81,"MrsHeisenberg","comment","","As someone who has felt this exact same way at one point, I'm really encouraging you to try and see a glimmer of hope. I know when you think of the future it seems worthless, you think you're not good enough, and thoughts to that extent. It's simply not true. You are very much capable of making a better life for yourself. Something that I found useful was creating very, very small goals for myself and soon enough they would turn into bigger goals. For example, I have severe social anxiety too, so I would start with a very small goal (which seems bigger in your head), like calling and making an appointment at the dentist or something of that nature! Small goals like this give you more confidence over time and you'll be doing things you never dreamed of doing in no time. nnI swear I have made my social anxiety so much more manageable without therapy and by just creating these goals for myself. I at one point had trouble just leaving the house. But now, I am a student, I have a new job, and also new job opportunities coming my way from putting myself out there. I started college this year, I'm 22. It's a pretty normal age to start believe it or not. It's actually better in my opinion because you know at this age you're a lot more determined and could value the education more for what it is. There are a lot of financial aid options out there. Don't think you can't do it. I thought that way for a long time too, but now that I'm a student it makes me wonder why I didn't start so much longer ago, (fyi: it was because I thought I couldn't all that time!) Even if you just start out with one class! Go for it! You can make your own destiny!nnMaking money and meeting a girl is NOT a pipe dream! YOU CAN DO IT! Believe in yourself, you are capable. Do you work at all? Try finding a job on Indeed.com or one of those websites just to get the cash flow starting. Through work you could find the girl of your dreams. You won't ever meet her if you don't put yourself out there. nnAlso, believe it or not but braces could be pretty affordable (I know, sounds crazy) But I'm not well to do by any means and was able to make payments of $175 a month for 2 years in order to pay mine off. Pretty reasonable if you ask me, especially for how confident my smile makes me feel now. You may have to come up with a grand or something like that up front, but again that is very doable if you have a job and start saving. Or, your parents may even be willing to help you if you explain to them this could give you the confidence you need to become better, but I don't know your relationship with them. nnDon't give up. I believe in you and I'm just a stranger. I hope you take my advice and start with some smaller goals for yourself, instead of thinking of the bigger picture and getting depressed. Nobody becomes successful overnight. Hang in and show yourself what you can do. nn"
139,"OneEarth3","comment","","I had a similar problem in my first and last relationship (it was also long distance). The main difference was that she actually treated me like crap. Even though she treated me really badly, my social anxiety, and being stressed out all the time was one of the main reasons I ended it. Eventually that fear and stress outweighed the attraction I once felt for her, and she wasn't open to talking through that sort of thing.nnI still regretted dumping her for a couple months afterwards, and had to constantly make lists of all the ways she had mistreated me to stop myself from going back to her. Despite the fact that I felt like I didn't need anyone while I was with her, I got more lonely than I had ever been after I left. It was a year before I started to think of it as purely a good decision.nnIf you break up with him just because of your anxiety, although I know it seems like the best way to get rid of your stress right now, I think you'll regret it, and see in the long run that it only made things worse. The same thing will happen in every relationship from now until the end of time, unless you find a way to trust him and talk to him about your fears.nnIf you talk to him, and just spill this entire post you wrote on him, what's the worst that could happen? Worst case scenario he leaves you, then you're free anyway without any guilt, and you'll know for sure that he wasn't equipped to handle your social anxiety. If he handles it well, then you've made the first important step to having a relationship that's actually trusting and fun. Go for it and tell him the whole thing. Write down your thoughts and text or email it to him if you have to, if you find that you can't say the words aloud."
185,"Gig472","comment","","You could try asking questions yourself.  Asking questions is a great way to keep  a conversation going. It takes the pressure off of you because the other person has to answer and it establishes that you genuinely want to know more about them and you care about what they have to say. You can even reciprocate the same types of questions they ask you.  As for therapy it is very helpful. If you want to find a therapist just go speak with a physician and tell them your concerns and they can refer you to a therapist. I am doing therapy myself and it focuses on things you can say to carry a conversation as well as setting goals to push yourself out of your comfort zone. I'm only 2 sessions in and already showing some progress so I highly recommend it."
204,"OneEarth3","comment","","I'm 21 and I've been single for all my life except for 1 month, 2 years ago. At first it was great, but she treated me pretty badly, so the appeal didn't last.nnI was diagnosed with social anxiety, and I still want a good relationship more than perhaps anything else. It's not just 'normal' people who want to be in relationships.nnI find that some people with SA allow their anxiety over relationships to gradually nullify their intimate emotions towards other people. That is sometimes a problem for me, but it gets easier to handle with exposure."

Getting a motorcycle is the only thing that would make me happy. It would get me out of my house and maybe I could even make some friends. I might even start a motovlogging channel on YouTube."
501,"TenaciousHotDog","comment","","Mics don't even have to be in the equation for me to feel freaked out. First time I ever tried going to a chatroom I was visibly shaking and took a solid 30 minutes or more just to work up the courage to sign in (and not talk). The effect isn't quite as debilitating now, but it's still rough doing pretty much anything. Even shit that's 99% anonymous with little to no communication like Rocket League or Pokemon.nnCould you have SAD, sure, what you describe is certainly a symptom, but I'm in no way qualified to diagnose anxiety disorders. However, I'm very much qualified to say that no it's not stupid."
521,"MisfitLove5","comment","","I have no idea why you're acting like a dick and assuming all of this about me. I've never used a single self help book and I never claimed to know everything. I'm simply talking about the issues I have. It's extremely hard for me to push myself into social situations which means it's difficult for me to push myself into therapy. It's like there's a barrier that prevents it."
522,"MisfitLove5","comment","","I don't really think I'm suicidal. There's pretty much zero chance I ever go through with it. I've just thought about how I would do it if I did go through with it. So maybe that is suicidal but I'm not in any danger right now.nnI just don't think I could go through counseling or therapy. I've just read so much about it and I feel like I'd have a ton of trouble buying in. I'm tired of hearing cliche advice. I've taken all if it and tried but it doesn't work. Maybe they won't give that advice, but I just don't know what they can say or do to help."
548,"Gig472","comment","","For your information I know very well what it feels like to be depressed and suicidal for months and even years at a time. I have been hospitilized because I made an actual attempt to kill myself a few months ago. I have the ability to bounce back quickly because I have been to lots of therapy. I posses the necessary coping skills and I can identify the early warning signs and catch myself before I fall into a deep depression. But your right I have no idea what depressed people go through. Remind me to tell my psychiatrist she's a dumbass for diagnosing me with MDD at my next appointment.nnYou know nothing about me or what I've been through, so stop making broad assumptions as if you do.nnEdit: My original post contains 5 paragraphs, but you just got hung up on a couple sentences that I've already conceded were a slight exaggeration. Furthermore, from the very start all you did was try to invalidate my feelings and then you try to order me around without any attempt to express empathy which is totally unhelpful. That is psych 101. Even I know that. So if you have nothing helpful to add then don't respond."
553,"ShinigamiSirius","comment","","Listen, OP. You sound just like me. I was relentlessly made fun of everywhere I went because of the way I looked. I was born with a huge forehead (I can fit 7 fingers between my eyebrow and my hairline) and people made sure to let me know how they thought I looked. 'Creepy,' 'weird,' 'old,' you name it. If it was direct bullying I could have coped better: all I have to do then is just fuck up the bullies. But when it is everyone and everywhere, what am I supposed to do? Confront all of them?nnI went from being an open, friendly person to what you described with a healthy dose of generalized anxiety disorder although I am always very warm to my friends. I, like you, became a hermit. I automatically assumed people were talking shit or calling me a freak. nnHOWEVER. Despite all that, I maintained discipline. I honestly think this is what prevented suicide. I work out, eat healthy, and when I was in college (graduated last year, good riddance) I did well in class. I shaved my head as well and the looks have gone way down. Now people think I'm 35-40 years old (I'm 23). Wonderful. But still, I feel way better about myself.nThis is what you have to do, OP. Get healthy. I know the thought of going to the gym forms knots in your belly. It still does every time and I've been going for years (anxiety affects how I move; self consciousness is a bitch). If your body is healthy you will have a good foundation to clear your issues. nnPick up meditation. Do it every day, starting at a measly 10 minutes per session. It'll take a while to see results but when you do it's amazing. More control over your anxiety, more ordered thoughts, resilience against stress... I could go on.nnSo fuck them. Work on yourself. Those self absorbed narcissistic fucks can talk shit all they want, but they should never break you. nnThe best advice I have read is to follow your anxiety. Gym causes you anxiety? Good. Go do it. Exposure therapy works, and it will get easier, I promise.nnI wrote this to help you but it was also cathartic for me. Thanks for listening and good luck to you."
578,"merme91","comment","","I am not very good at making friends due to social anxiety and depression but I still want to pursue my dream and move to Ireland one day (I live in Belgium now). I don't like it here, I don't like the people and it's hard to integrate yourself as a foreigner (I've heard that a lot). I think the place where you live has a great impact on how you feel and with the right help you can really improve yourself. I hope I will get better before moving away but some places just make you happier than others.nIf you don't like where you live now and there's a place you just dream of calling your home, go for it, get therapy, get help and you can do it. Just moving away and hoping the circumstances are going to change everything won't work."
579,"merme91","comment","","I'd do a social skills/assertiveness training. I can't share any experiences yet but I'm gonna start quite a long training in 2 weeks, it's specially for people with social anxiety. My therapist referred me to it. But there are loads of trainings just for people who want to improve themselves who don't necessarily suffer from anxiety. I think it's worth a try!"
580,"merme91","comment","","Please talk to your therapist about this. He/she has probably noticed it anyways? Maybe your therapist just goes too fast or is too directive. Would you rather want to ease into it? Talk about something less threatening first before starting with more difficult topics? I hope you can figure this out with him/her. Therapy is not easy and it'll take time until it gets better. I still wanna run away when I'm in the waiting room to be honest. But please don't give up! I'm proud of you for taking this step!"
581,"merme91","comment","","Yes that sounds like a good idea! Form is just way too important with weight lifting, I'm sure you'd benefit from some sessions with him :) or you can always ask other people hanging out there to correct you or show you how to do it right? I might do that when I want to try something new (would challenge my anxiety too ;))"
586,"merme91","comment","","Wow that sounds absolutely amazing! I'd freak out if my therapist gave me homework like that, I could never do it.. :/ I am so proud of you! "
598,"Charisma_Corner","comment","","I'm sorry to hear about the problems with your parents. I am also 24 years old and have a lot of difficulties getting along with my parents, especially my father. Your mother is foolish for enforcing the stigma present in seeking help for psychological/mental disorders. Mental illnesses are extremely misunderstood, and I believe everyone should see a specialist along with their normal physician. Personally, I do not suffer from social anxiety. I grew up the extroverted brother of two and studied Communication at SDSU. However, my brother is extremely introverted, along with several of my friends, and I have seen the side-effects of poor social skills/behavior. Seeing people suffer from depression and social anxiety is difficult, so I created a blog (http://charismacorner.com/) with a friend of mine to help people with tips, hacks, articles and resources to combat social anxiety and foster social confidence. For now, I think you should talk to as many people as possible, and focus on the things that truly interest you. If you ever need someone to talk to, please reach out to us, we would love to hear what you have to say. Thank you."
601,"MisfitLove5","comment","","It makes sense, but I have a lot of trouble buying into things that therapists say. I'm not saying they're scamming or anything like that, I just have trouble buying into anything that says I'm not the problem or that nothing is wrong with me. I just can't see it any other way."
602,"raron_aeger","comment","","I have not been official diagnosed with social anxiety but have been feeling affects as far as I can remember ( I'm 19). When I meet people it almost feels like the ranking system of a military. What I mean by this is a successful man, or beautiful woman will make me feel like a private talking to general, I feel like a small little bug who does not deserve the time or respect of whom I'm talking to. Other times I witness someone talking back and I am shocked and think to my self how could anyone say that to this person. This is starting to become a big issue for me in college"
608,"Anonymous242001","comment","","I am a 15 year old just like you. I didn't have Social Anxiety until I hit puberty. I am afraid to get out on the balcony. When I go out I always think what others think about me. I say excuses to my mother and stay inside my house. At school I get nervous and like you i don't come out of my room when guest comes. I  afraid to put my profile pic on Facebook because I am concerned about people negativity. I get very anxious when I go out in public places. I get nervous talking to girls my age or older. I am thinking about consulting a psychiatrist."
614,"gdaykunt","comment","","Definitely do what tapiocaloaf suggested, write down notes of some sort and organise the major issues you wish to express. I did this before my first ever appointment with my own psychologist.nnLike myself, you seem like you have issues putting your thoughts into words on the spot. But once you write notes down you will be able to express your issues clear and concise and the psychologist should be able to understand you which will make it easier for them to read you, and make it a lot easier for you to communicate. That's what it's like for me, and my appointments have all been pretty successful.nnFeel free to keep in contact with me, seeing as we're both seeing psychologists. Sharing experiences could help us both!"
623,"MyNameIsntSuspicous","comment","","I'm only 16, though. I'm honestly not sure if I could even get a benzo or something like that at my age. I'm just scared my doctor doesn't care. I've been to him 3 times and every single visit he's never brought up sleep and helping me go to sleep. It's so hard talking to him, too. Not that he's mean or obnoxious I just get scared talking to anyone and my face goes bright red. "
686,"fatrice_","comment","","Thank you for reading it. I was pretty emotional when I wrote it. I have yet to see a therapist or a counselor. The reason being is that I'm afraid that it might cost a lot of money. And I don't go to the college counselor because people might see me go and they would (I know they wouldn't but I couldn't help but think) judge me or something, I know, paranoid.nnThat being said, have you? And I agree with you, I have bright hopes for the future, but not now."
687,"NASCARaddict24","comment","","Yes I used to take Celexa which at low doses treats anxiety but once you get above 20-2mg it starts to become more of a medicine that treats depression. And yes the sucky thing is it does take a long time for these medicines to start working. 4-6 weeks to build up in your system. At 6 weeks you should be able to tell if it is helping or not. Also remember that it isn't going to magically make you just start talking to anyone and everyone; it takes the edge off so you can basically function and make that decision :D you got this bud!!!"
700,"dinosaurrrrrrrrrrrr1","comment","","I think if it's something that's concerning you, maybe talk to a counselor. nnWhen I first met with a counselor I really went in for depression, I didn't even mention social anxiety disorder (though I was pretty sure I had it from my own online research) and they ended up diagnosing me primarily with social anxiety after I had explained all of my symptoms.nnIt is my understanding that social anxiety disorder can affect people in many different ways and on different levels. For example, I can talk to waiters at restaurants with no issues whatsoever, I can take a theatre class and perform a monologue without any hesitation. For some people with social anxiety disorder, these things are extremely difficult and anxiety-inducing. Other people with social anxiety are totally fine with certain sorts of social settings that I would find totally debilitating. Everyone's different.  nnIf you're comfortable/interested in seeing a counselor then you could at least get some of these feelings off your chest. Even if you don't have social anxiety, they can provide support and help you with things like coming up with conversation topics, etc."
702,"fatrice_","comment","","No don't worry. When I first posted this, I actually wanted to feel that I was able to relate to others and I'm happy that you did.nnAnd it's nice to see that you are holding it together. And honestly, even though there are feeling of self-hatred and thinking that I am not normal and anxiety and so on, there's a part of me that is sort of, well... thankful. Thankful that because of what happened in the past few months, I got to learn more about myself.nnI realise that I love my privacy. I love being able to just be with myself. I love not having people going through my locker anymore. I love that people aren't taking advantage of the fact that I have stuff. And it has also made me reflect back on what I want in my friends. And these thoughts makes sure that I'm not regretting what can't be changed, which is the past.nnAnd with these appreciations, I am taking new steps in, which I can say, a redefinition of who I am. I'm taking steps in controlling my anxiety and depression. Albeit, a very, very tiny step, which is, I talked to my mum about this problem. Honestly, our family is not so hot about talking about problems. So, I'm hoping that by me taking the first steps, I can sort of make it a thing in my family. Besides, I wanted my parents to know about me, and I want to be able to depend on them. And also, I might be starting therapy in February or March, since I've finished my preparatory studies.nnI'm hoping that you don't fall into the traps set by anxiety and depression. And if you have, take a moment to find things that you love yourself for, and find positivity in the realisation. And, if you ever need to talk to someone, I just want to say that I'm here. And I understand. Granted, I might not be of much help in terms of giving advices but hopefully we can solve it together. Or something."

747,"MightyJigsaw","comment","","I have never heard of someone overcoming social anxiety by ""It was from kind, supportive, knowledgeable people who knew that while doing nothing wouldn't help, belittling and insulting me would be even worse"". I have overcome a big part of my social anxiety by being hard to myself and being extremely uncomfortable. Any youtube video or post here of someone overcoming social anxiety will say the same thing as me concerning being uncomfortable. People don't get better if we treat them like victims. They need a good push in the back to get up and to overcome social anxiety. Life is tough, claiming otherwise will only make people on this sub feel like others are the issue and they will be in denial.nnI hope one day you find the way to overcome social anxiety, but I can tell you for sure that by being in the magical dreamland you are where everyone loves each other, you won't get anywhere. I did the complete opposite of the advice people were giving each other here and I am almost over social anxiety, when I was once severely depressed. It wasn't by taking pills or going to therapy, it was by being hard on myself.   "
811,"merme91","comment","","I can especially relate to the first part of your post. I really really want to get to know new people, I crave friendships and relationships but at the same time I am absolutely terrified of being rejected. It's definitely really lonely. I asked my therapist if she thinks I have avoidant personality disorder because I can identify with like 90% of I've read about it but maybe I'm not doing quite that bad.. Or at least she didn't want to give me that diagnosis. However, I under your struggle and I hate it."
823,"merme91","comment","","You have to talk back to that voice. It's hard at first, my therapist started doing it for me and now it's getting easier to believe people like me when they are nice to me. It's really about changing your thought patterns.. there are a lot of ways to work on that, like writing down your negative thought and trying to turn it into a reasonable thought, or maybe even a good one. But you have to practise it. Everything you think is just an interpretation, so why not try to make more good ones instead of bad ones?"
824,"merme91","comment","","My situation was different from yours but nevertheless I felt like absolute shit a year ago and today things are better. If someone had told me this last year I wouldn't have believed them because I was in that downward spiral for years and years but yes. Things get better. It's not something people just say. Life goes up and down and it's been going down for a long time and atm, it's going up. Finally. Don't give up hope, do your best with therapy or medication, try a social skills training, whatever sounds helpful to you. Just don't give up."

858,"merme91","comment","","I can only suggest doing a social skills/assertiveness training. My therapist recommended one to me and it's been helping so much with my social anxiety.

Maybe there's something like this too where you live."

960,"SceneFromaMemory_123","comment","","I'm not saying I want numerous hookups and be a ""sex god"", I'm just saying that people who started dating at 16 (which is most common, at least where I live), already had 3 or 4 partners since teen relationships are actually more casual, about fun and never last too long. At my age people start getting serious because they already experienced all the fun and probably want something more meaningful, but I don't really want that because I missed the fun part that I still need/desire in order to move on.nnAs I mentioned, that's not the only thing that I'm too old for (it's also much harder to find friends at my age, the only thing that I wanted as a carrer is now impossible to start from scratch etc.), so my entire life circles around that to the point where I can't think of anything else anymore and *it's killing me* from the moment I wake up in the morning. And it's only getting worse. I was visiting therapist last year (one of the most successful in my town) and after about 5 months, not a slightest improvement.nnSo, *that's* what I ment and I think it's completely *reasonable* to feel that way but thanks for reminding me that I'll never ever have that. :)nnEDIT"
986,"TenaciousHotDog","comment","","Well, let's put it this way -- I got my first permit at 20 years old in 2014, and 3 years later all I have to show for it is two expired permits, a single-digit number of driving sessions, and still no license. nnGranted, there are numerous reasons for this, but the biggest one is just anxiety. How some people can actually *enjoy* the act of driving is something that baffles my mind. When I'm driving I'm incredibly tense, panicky, hyper-aware of everything, constantly afraid that I'm a split second and one minor mistake away from thousands of dollars in damages. Relaxation is the furthest thing from my mind. nnThat said, the anticipation is actually far worse than the driving for whatever reason. Being on the road is awful, but it's tolerable. I mean it's not like driving is hard or anything. It's pretty damn easy. Thinking about driving though just instantly fills me with nervous dread, and I have no idea why. And it doesn't seem to get better with exposure either. The first time I was just a little nervous, but mostly filled with curiosity and the desire to learn. But then with each successive trip I just got more and more tense and my eagerness completely vanished. "
1010,"Mollusk_Incognito","comment","","I've been wondering lately if this is the case. My parents were always very distant and militantly anti-therapy of any kind, or anything mental health.  I think it's because both of them were trying to protect me from their own shit (which obviously fucking came out in the end anyway), but I feel that I never really learned to understand, articulate,or  do anything with my own feelings for whatever reason, so I never considered that maybe depression might be something I'm experiencing.nnA friend of mine who was diagnosed as major depressive after years of confusion told me that it was like everything just suddenly clicked, made perfect sense, when someone finally suggested she might be depressed.  Lately that's been ringing more true for me."
1029,"Mollusk_Incognito","comment","","All of this except one thing describes me.  If it please the lord, I try not to think of it as a condition I *have*, instead something that I *experience*.  I don't like the idea of self-diagnosing, or blaming SA for my problems in life (""because of my SA, I will never ____,"" etc).  I'm not shy, and I don't consider myself a victim; but I do experience varied and often extreme levels of anxiety in social situations.nnMoreover, people can experience SA without this one genetic mutation.  It can be cultivated by a confluence of psychological factors and environmental ones.  I don't care how *legit* they are, which seems to be your concern.  If a person suffers from a feeling anywhere in this area I'm sure you'd agree they deserve to be helped.  It's no fun to fight this."

After 6 months if symptoms still persist, then the road to be your 'normal' self can take years. My doctors started telling me around the 7th month (they were being realistic, which doesn't upset me) that I have to get used to a 'new me'. I can go back to school, but only take one class a semester (only had 7 classes left which would've been two semesters, but now it's looking like 7 semesters).  The main reason I'm home almost all the time is because of chronic headaches and migraines that arose from the brain trauma and some dizziness and vision issues that make it difficult to be by myself for more than an hour or so. nnI was a very active, healthy 22 year old girl and not being able to do much took a huge toll on me. Whenever my friends are too lazy to go out and do stuff (which is most of the time) I just want to shake them and force them to leave and enjoy themselves!!! People swear that life is guaranteed. Nothing in this goddamn life is guaranteed. Enjoy life while you can. nnSeriously. I was shopping for pants and almost died. It doesn't take much!!!

Where I live, yeah, the stigma is around but while I think this job sounds great, taking up a job and disappearing to doctor's appointments every week/month is probably going to look a little suspicious if I don't declare (at least that is what I think, not sure if anybody has a different story to tell, hence the question) that I have SA.

1122,"InTheSunrise","comment","","Ever tried making anxiety your friend instead of trying to make it ""disappear""? My doctor ever once mentioned that you not accepting of your anxiety is like piling more anxiety about the anxiety you already have, in other words, it doesn't help in the least bit. Anxiety doesn't kill, and there are tons of people on this sub including myself that have experienced positive results from doing things that SA insists you absolutely cannot do because it's ""Bad, scary, terrifying, (insert own reason here) etc"".  nnI don't know of anyone who LOVES feeling anxiety, in fact, till today I still downright HATE it, but again, plenty of people on this sub including you and me has tried making anxiety go away and we (probably) know how well that worked out. It's an eternal waiting game and one you're as of now, not likely to win anyways. "

I have dysthymia as well and if it wasn't for my fearful nature (fear actually helping somewhat here!), I probably wouldn't be here typing this today. I'll echo what others say, time to find a counselor or any professional, someone you could actually express yourself out to face to face as I feel you're in a pretty dark place right now and you are definitely going to need some assistance and some coping techniques to move yourself out of a rut.nnAlso try keeping a journal, if you're lazy to write, you can always find a couple online ones where you could simply type, at least for me, it helps as a venting tool and while it may not necessarily solve problems, it will probably bring you some kind of relief overall.

1129,"InTheSunrise","comment","","Yeah that's kind of what I mean, it's going to take time. nnYeah of course, we all do to a certain extent, I don't know of anyone who WANTS or LOVES getting rejected by other people. A person who truly, completely doesn't care about other people's opinion has other life problems of their own. Socially anxious people like us means that the fear has gotten so big that it begins to or already has affected our normal functions in life and that's not healthy.nnI would take advice from non SA sufferers with a grain of salt (qualified doctors might be a different story), they may have great intentions but they cannot truly empathize with something they have never experienced before. That's not to say everything they say is horse shit, but if it resonates for you, great, if it doesn't, thank them for their goodwill and move on.nnIf you're not terribly in need of money, consider just taking a short break for a while also getting some professional help, I do not know the details of your circumstances but I think this will be beneficial somewhat. Also perhaps look into getting involved in some yoga, meditations etc, things that would probably benefit your psyche.nn"

If they're too busy worrying about their social appearance in the church community (and damn, gossiping about other people as well?) to grasp what's happening with their own kid their priorities are wrong, straight up. In principle I like the idea of the greeting, community is important and it sounds like a nice bit of exposure therapy and whatnot, but that's really only valuable if it's you putting yourself there, not pressure from others.nnFull disclosure and separate point, I totally agree that this sort of implicitly obligatory community centered on moral imperatives is a cause of SA.  I'm a pantheist, but I've had a lot of christians in my life get really fucking twisted up trying to be what their family and church community want them to be and it makes me really sad to watch them suffer.  Believe what you like and be happy about it, just make sure that it's really you who's believing it, that's literally the only thing that matters.nnBut yea like, is this something you could talk to them about?  Or maybe with some counselor in your church if you're into that?  Just about how to move forward.  Maybe you could find a compromise, like, half the time you don't have to go, and the other half you'll try super hard to get through it?  I'm sure there's a way to figure it out :)"

I'm 23 now. I promise you, you can get there too. Remember: it's not all one leap. It's lots of little little hurdles, and then one day you wake up and find yourself where you want to be. It starts with the first little hurdle. nnWhat you are experiencing sounds a lot like Generalised Anxiety Disorder; I really, really really suggest going and booking an appointment with a psychologist, and possibly getting on some medication for anxiety. It will let you see the future in a different light. Regardless, book an appointment with a doctor and get in to see a psychologist, talk to a professional. You can do this. I've been there too, and I'm just so content now... if you had told me that a couple of years ago I wouldn't have believed it. You will get there, to a happier and more content place, I know it. nn"

Or atleast cut it down to max weekend.nnI used to be in a similar situation as you are except i guess im a bit younger than you are (i'm 20 yrs old and started smoking at around 14). I felt that weed was starting to make me anxious but i insisted on smoking anyway mainly because it was a habit and everyone else did it aswell. Well it got to a point when i couldn't smoke around anybody without getting socially anxious. Even with the social anxiety i insisted on smoking masochistically for quite a while until it kinda got unbearable. then i ""retired"" my smoking activities into the comfort of my own home in the evenings. I kept doing that for quite a while but it still made me anxious and socially uncomfortable even in the daytimes when i hadn't smoked. I had a lot of phases of smoking less when feeling more anxious, and then going back to smoking everyday because i thought i got rid of the anxiety, only to find out that i hadn't. I kept lying to myself and went back and forth in those phases probably dozens of times.nn Until i got to a point where the anxiety got so bad that i got shortness of breath for a couple of days after every smoking session. Even if i smoked just one small bowl of weed.nnFast forward to this day. I dont smoke anymore. At all. nThe price i have to pay for smoking masochistically and lying to myself for many years: Continuous social anxiety and negative thoughts. I do have better and worse days and there are some things that help.

I have this habit of hesitating and then just not taking any actions at all. I'm a huge procrastinator. My major issue is definitely the social anxiety though. I went to see a therapist a couple of years back and in my weak and vulnerable state, I got way too attached and had to stop seeing her. That's a super embarrassing thing for me to look back on. Plus, I was in a bad car accident a few years back in which the van I was in rolled several times along the highway. That didn't help my anxiety any and didn't help my habit of living inside of my head either. I must have relived that accident in my head about a million times. So yeah, you're not alone.

It's always been a frustrating process for me. I really wish this were more of a viable option for me, as I don't even want to spend my time shopping, even if it didn't make me feel nervous. But my body is weird, and moreover, yes, I would like to fix and understand this problem. I did see a therapist for a time, but she seemed to think I was normal (which is cool, although I would beg to differ) and brushed over this issue. I guess it does sound really stupid. "
1258,"thrashette","comment","","Thank you for your response. Yes, I feel infinitely more comfortable in an empty store, but even then, the loud music and the employees (I know they're just doing their job!) get to me. I hate how stores play like that runway music... it makes me so self conscious, like, I don't want to be walking in tune to this music. How do I walk out of tune with this music? It's just odd... ha. nnAnd oddly enough, I have no problem with quick ""in-and-out"" shopping. If a store has a specific item that I need, and I know exactly where it is, nbd. I go in, grab it, leave, without really thinking or feeling anything. Maybe I'm just very overwhelmed and need more set goals in terms of what I want, rather than just ""clothes."" But I'm having trouble figuring that out due to my age and not really having a ""style"" anymore (and not really liking today's fashion.)nnAs for not leaving my room, it does depress me a little, but I'm somewhat comfortable with it. I used to go out a ton and had a lot of fun, but part of that was looking nice and wearing cool clothes. I know it sounds superficial, but I don't like looking and feeling like a bum. So I'm kind of too embarrassed to go out. I know that if I could rectify this issue, I wouldn't miss out on so much, but I'm kind of a loner/homebody/nerd, and I'm pretty content with it.nnI do need to, ahem, shop around a bit for a better therapist if this persists, but that too is pretty uncomfortable for me. :p"

I've tried that and learned that drinking in no way inspires me to do something I already don't want to do. But I love your idea and would like to apply it to something more healthy, like creating a special, bomb-ass playlist. Maybe I'll even find some earbuds and take them with me... I will try this tomorrow, as I kind of need to. Thank you."
1353,"Gatored","comment","","Most of my life, I've been a ""nice guy"". So I can relate with you.nnIn my experience, most of that behavior stems from the relationship with your parents. Neurotic behaviors get unconsciously passed from parents to children. So I would probe back to your childhood.nnWhat were your parents like? Did you have an overbearing mom or dad? Was your family religious? Did your parents communicate, overtly or indirectly, to you that sex was taboo?nnThat's my story. I grew up in a religious home, with an overbearing mom. And I learned from a very young age to please my mom. In order to receive love—in my mind—I had to keep her happy and be the perfect person and do everything right.nnI also learned from a young age to repress my sexuality. I learned not to play with myself. And I got brainwashed in church that sex was taboo; all the boilerplate ""don't have sex before marriage"", yadda yadda.nnAll that shit massively affected me, and still affects me to this day. It's a journey unwinding yourself from the mess. But you've got no other choice.nnYou may need to seek a therapist, or someone you can talk to about your past. nnAt the very least, you should do some therapeutic writing (freehand, unfiltered writing) and probe into your past, and try to discover why you are the way you are.nnWhen you understand your past, you can formulate a better game plan to make peace with it, and thus live a better life here and now.nnPM me if you have any questions."

1556,"Stump_Patrol","comment","","Have before used a couple therapists, but often felt it was time consuming and too expensive for my parents if they even wanted to go that route anymore. I was actually sent away to a wilderness camp (Elements in Utah) for 9 weeks about a couple years ago so therapy has left a very sour taste in my mouth. If you dont know what that is, it's basically like being taken away in the middle of the night not knowing where the fuck you are going. Worst 9 weeks of my life, didnt get much out of it at all. But my mom had mentioned medication before and we never actually tried that route. I just hate to be dependent on a drug to make myself better in public. I already smoke too much BHO and started drinking hard liquor recently to make life enjoyable. Used to pop lots of pills (xans, molly, percocet) so would rather fix this from the source than becoming reliant on some pill to make my life better. Thanks for your input tho friend"

1634,"Emperor_Mr_B","comment","","I have just recently finished high school and I know what it's like to go through it with SA. It has made me feel absolutely miserable about life by the end of it. My advise is to get treated as soon as possible. Seeing a therapist or going to the school canceller is a good first step. It will inevitably take a long time, but with the help of medication and your chosen specialist, you will need to slowly build up your social skills and regain your confidence. Getting treatment for your SA really shouldn't be put off, otherwise you will end up like me, sitting there alone for five years without a friend in the world. You will feel too nervous to ask questions or to ask for help, even though you need help the most. You will feel too nervous to work with other people, so you will fail entire subjects as a result. Every Single school social event becomes an absolute nightmare for you. You end up leaving high school without a single fond memorie. Trust me, you really need to get help. "
1646,"AG4014","comment","","I (25M) have had social anxiety disorder (SAD) since I was very little. I don't know what caused it. It was worst in my younger years (age 11-19). At hat time, I didn't know it was a disorder. I thought I was just shyer than everyone else. But one day, I was frustrated after having a bad day due to my SAD and I went online and googled if anyone else has the same problem as me. Then I found out that so many people have the same issue and that it is called Social Anxiety **Disorder** . As soon as I found out it was a disease not a personality trait, I realized that I can get rid of it if I asked God (Jesus) to heal me. Right there and then,  I went down in my knees and asked God to take it away.  From that day on, the SAD started fading away little by little. That was 4 years ago. Now my SAD is very little compared to where I was and I notice a change every week. I remember not being able to make eye contact in conversation 3 years ago. Now I can do it easily and I even initiate conversations myself. You can search around and you will never find a cure for SAD because it is a mental/spiritual problem. Medicine, CBT or therapy will not cure it but the way I did it can cure it. I am just patiently waiting for little time to pass until I can be totally free. The formula is :Pray to Jesus Christ having full faith that he can heal you.  Keep in mind that you might be cured much faster than me.  God has different plans for everyone. But if you believe in him, he won't disappoint you. I am a born again believer. I know a couple of born again believers who had SAD and are now free of it. If you are not a believer, you should get on that path for complete freedom. Start by saying this prayer ""God, I know that I have sinned against you and I am deserving of punishment. But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven. I place my trust in You for salvation. Thank you for your wonderful grace and forgiveness - the gift of eternal life Amen!"". Remember saying this prayer or any other prayer won't save you. It is only trusting in Christ that can save you. This prayer is simply to express to God your faith in him and thank him for providing for your salvation. God bless you and your brother. I wish you guys well. "

While sitting there I would become overwhelmed with feelings of loneliness, uselessness, and hopelessness. It would all just make me feel absolutely awful about myself. I just can't help but stare aimlessly out of the window. But it usually came to an end by the time I got home. From the best that I can describe it, it is like having a miniature bout of depression, but overall I can comfortably say that I don't have depression. I just can't help but let it take over my mind. Then it started happening during class time and at home. It would absolutely take over for like an entire morning or evening for example, and I would lose all motivation to work. At first, it wasn't a every day or week thing. I would have on and off periods of it throughout the year, but it was in no way consistent or constant. And now sense I have finished high school, over the last three months it has got progressively worse. It is now nearly both a daily and nightly thing. Sometimes it gets so bad, that it just makes me want to cry. My parents don't know about this. Nobody else knows about my problems. I only ever tend to have these sessions while I'm alone. I've always been quite good at hiding my problems, but the time is coming and I will have to come forth about it. nnYou in the meantime, should be quite grateful for what you have.

By facing these sort of situations, you’ll start to learn that your misconceptions about social situations are incorrect and over time it’ll start to ease the anxiety you feel. It’ll be a good way to practice your social skills too and over time you’ll start to feel more confident.nI’d also recommend talking to a therapist (since as the name implies, it’s a form of anxiety) and they’ll have you go through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, which will force you to challenge negative automatic thoughts that cause you to feed back on your anxiety.nFortunately, if you don’t want to go to in-person therapy, you can still overcome this through CBT based online programs. These are essentially the same thing as in-person CBT, but instead you work with an online coach who guides you through it. A great program I’d recommend is the one they offer on joyable.com (keep in mind, you do have to pay around $200-$300). "
1867,"Notsadjustalone","comment","","Everyone regrets the cringey things they've done in the past. I know I've had my fair share. How to overcome it is to think back to your thought processes that led to the behaviours you regret, realise why you did it and forgive yourself. It may seem cringey now but it obviously seemed like a good idea at the time, so don't beat yourself up about it.nnFor example, I ran away from a treatment centre when I was 14 for no apparent reason. I cringed about it for years afterwards because I was just being a complete inconvenience and jeopardised my chance at recovery. But when I thought about it, I was 14 which is a fragile age anyway, and there was actually very little treatment going on at the centre and the staff were only around at mealtimes or to tell us to be quiet, so I realised I did it because I felt I was being ignored and forgotten about, and didn't have the treatment in place in order to develop better coping skills. nnBy learning why we did these things, and empathising with ourselves, we make it easier to live with our past, and learn from it in the future.

And in your life right now, you may be alone throughout the day, but you don't know what tomorrow brings. You can work on what tomorrow brings however, and its going to take some work. nnI'd first suggest doing small things to improve your anxiety like mediation or even talking in-front of the mirror. The first thing you can do right now is promise yourself you wont bad mouth yourself for a week, go EASY ON YOURSELF! If you dont like yourself why would other people? Replace your negative thoughts with positive ones. nnGo online look at potential online therapies, I've done a few, and the first thing they teach is to get rid of NEGATIVE THOUGHTS. They are making you feel crippled, and then you need to change your beliefs. nnBe strong and Stop feeling sorry for yourself, you can do this. nIt IS ACHIEVABLE "
1890,"theanxietyfairy","comment","","You’re not alone in that one nnThat’s currently what I’m struggling with right now. I’m in university so last summer I did a 9-5 job and it was soooo so exhausting being anxious every day, I had to leave 3 weeks before my last day. Come around to this summer, I couldn’t conjure up the courage to do another job because of that last experience. Which is of course extremely problematic for my future.nnSo I’ve started therapy to try to be able to learn how to manage it before I graduate it. Because that’s my only option really.nnI had good and bad days on that job, of course, so I know I can work to have mostly good days. I just have to patient with myself. I’ve made similar progress where before I couldn’t do one shift of a part time job without crying from anxiety attacks, and eventually I was able to do get through them fine and even have fun— only with occasional anxiety.nnThis is just the next step. But it is hard to pull all stops to make sure you’re able to function nnYou can do it though :)"

Just take deep breaths before going in and remember that there’s no judgement from your therapist. There’s no “right” or “wrong” way to express yourself, but they will try to help you change any thinking that isn’t helpful."

1976,"krispeon","comment","","Lol, I'm also 19!!!!! I've had a couple jobs and I got my first  one about a year ago. I dropped out of high school because of my social anxiety and depression. I've had like 5 different jobs since leaving and it's honestly really hard. I've had millions of interviews which I've totally bombed because I am so awkward and I get so anxious, I think your best bet is to prepare yourself for interviews and like get to know the place you want to work at. I worked in a deli for a couple months and I never really spoke to anyone, I just quietly did my work and everyone knew I was the quiet one who just worked away, jobs that require you to do tasks like, on your own are probably the best to look out for (kitchen, deli, Baker positions are all good examples) you'll eventually get comfortabler as time goes on and you'll possibly have more interviews.... My therapist always told me that if you ever feel really anxious about something just imagine what it's going to feel like after you accomplish the task. Maybe start small, like handing in your resume somewhere and work your way up to calling places and asking if they're hiring. Just baby steps until you really get a feel for what it's like I guess. It takes alot of trial and error, but it pays off in the end!!!! Honestly it takes alot of strength to do stuff like this w/ social anxiety and it may seem overwhelming at first but you will survive and you will be able to do it, it just takes time and practice :) nnnnnAlso protip: practice interviews are great, even if you just do one in the mirror and build your self confidence up a bit, it gets so much easier. You got this!!!"

Than I went to a second session with a new person and I didn't really like her so there was no motivation to go back since I had already done my required session"

2098,"couchrealistic","comment","","At least you have a car. When a friend convinced me to go to a party (in school, maybe at age 12) for the first time (excluding kid's birthday parties), his parents dropped us off outside the school. We then started walking to the room where the party took place, but before we got there, I decided that I really can't go there. So I sat down on the floor and waited a couple of hours. Other students walked past me when they went to and came back from the party, and if I remember correctly, some of them actually asked me why I sit there and were like ""WTF?!?!?"" (not sure if I managed to respond anything sensible). Finally it was time for us to get picked up by his parents and they brought us back home.nnUgh. I wonder why my parents decided to not send me to therapy back then. I mean, I couldn't be much weirder than that.nnMy little brother decided to actually have a party of his own in his own room when he was like 11 years old. So he partied hard while I (few years older) was sitting in my room, playing WoW. :-) How can we be so different? His personality is the complete opposite in some very positive ways. I'm glad he likes me no matter what."

People regularly guess that I'm a teenager, or that I can't come get drinks with them.nnIt's hell for dating. Despite getting treated usually like I'm attractive, it doesn't actually matter to adult women - looking so much younger is an instant turnoff. They're looking for men and I seem like a boy. Dating was easier in high school where I fit the expectations more, even if I didn't capitalize on it very much due to huge anxiety. But now it's just totally different, can't get matches on dating apps for example, looking like a boy at my age just seems to be an instant no, whether I'm good looking and in shape or not.nnOn a positive note, nobody who becomes friends with me ever thinks of me as young at all. Once someone gets to know me, they see my maturity and would never think of my as a teenager, so that's nice! It's just hard for the times when first impressions are important."

I've pretty much been a shut-in for years but decided it was time to make some changes a few years ago.  nnI was seeing some support workers every other day, started seeking help from a psychologist, went to support groups, tried volunteering, and even got into working out. To the point that I was eventually going to the gym everyday. nnAnyway, long story short I met a guy whilst at the gym and I'd say we became friends. He was a regular at the gym I went to and kindly helped me with getting used to working out and how to do everything correctly. nnWe got on well since we both had similar interests and he had dealt with mental health issues as well so he seemed to be very patient and understanding with me. nnWe would see each other almost everyday at the gym and work out together regularly. Although not many conversations were had since neither of us were overly talkative. But whenever we did I almost felt lost. It seemed like a huge challenge just to think of something to say and I'm sure there were many times when I was unintentionally offensive or inappropriate. nnI think about conversations I've had days ago or even years ago. What could I have done differently? Maybe if I was more talkative or showed some emotion I'd still have friends?nnAround 6-7 months after meeting him I kind of just woke up one morning and felt like it had all been a huge lie. Since when am I able to talk to people or go outside on a regular basis?nnI'm ashamed to say that the realisation of all that sent me into a bit of a tailspin.

There are plenty of people who prefer not to for one reason or another.nnI think it’s a pretty millennial college kid thing to be open or at least joke about your personal struggles with mental illnesses. Finding friends who also struggle is really nice. You can directly say “sorry I’m running on like 2 spoons I gotta stay home tonight” and they understand. That said, some people are more friend-reliant / can’t afford a therapist; as it goes anyway, you can’t be friends with everyone.nnKeep in mind too it’s like everyone’s first day of kindergarten.

I think a lot of us with social anxiety get stuck in a negative feedback loop. I know for me personally, girls would like me but I wouldn't make any sort of move (because I was nervous). So while other people are getting in relationships and you are not it's easy to think the reason is that ""i'm not attractive enough."" I use to struggle with this a lot too. nn&amp;#x200B;nnI'm 24, married now. I met my future wife in the dorm we were living in during college. We became close friends for about a year before we finally got involved romantically.

I'm on paxil, propananol and klonopin and that helped tremendously. If you want to stay of prescription medication I also found Benadryll and CBD Oil to help.

I start every day before work with a run or some sort of other aerobic activity and that has made a total difference. nn&amp;#x200B;nnAnd man you aren't a loser. You are going through something that the majority of the people around you will never experience. I know how hard it is, everyday can be a struggle.

Luckily I was able to tell my parents a couple months ago and they were supportive. But now that I'm being forced to confront my issues it's terrifying. I'm an anxious wreck. I was able to email an anxiety center nearby and they think exposure therapy would help and I agree with them. Now I have to work up the courage to go to this place and talk with someone about my issues, which is exactly what I've been trying to put off all these years.nnI guess it doesn't hurt to try though. I think the best way to beat this is to confront our anxiety head on. Just start small and continue to work your way up. I know it's easier said than done but that's what I'm trying to do.

I've also been severely anxious over the family gatherings coming up and have also been having suicidal thoughts because of it. I feel like a lunatic. These kind of things should be seen as fun, right? I love my family and people in general too but the anxiety becomes too much to bear around this time of the year.nnRegarding how to tell your parents. It's really tough, especially if they're religious like mine are. I just told them that I have bad social anxiety and think I need help. That's really all there is to it. It went well and they were sympathetic but they ultimately said to go to god with these problems because he's the ultimate healer or something. They didn't think therapy would work. But at least they had my back. And if your parents are loving they should have yours too.nnNow, on to the solution. Obviously we both need help, especially if suicidal thoughts are popping into our heads to get away from these social situations. So what I'm looking into doing is exposure therapy. I contacted an anxiety center nearby about it and am currently in the process of seeing if my insurance would cover it. Let me tell you this shit is terrifying to me. But I know I need to break free from the anxiety before I do something stupid like take my own life.nnI wish you the best of luck my friend. I'll be rooting for you.

2554,"basketball_is_life","comment","","I feel you on so many fronts - about appearing weak if I told anyone about my anxiety, missing out on so many things in high school, wishing I could just ditch everything and go anywhere but the present. All I can really say is that the quicker you reach out for help the better. Don't try to just cope with social anxiety or it'll continue to eat you up inside until it's too late. I'm 22 years old and finally took a step towards recovery in contacting an anxiety center in my area and am looking towards exposure therapy to help me out. And I honestly wish I'd done it sooner. I'm a mess man. Way more anxious than I was even a year earlier. It took hitting rock bottom and constant suicidal thoughts to force me to reach for help.nnAs for how to tell your parents, I know it'll be tough. I never thought I'd tell mine but I ended up being straight up with them. One day I told them I had social anxiety and how it's difficult for me to do certain things that normal people wouldn't have a problem with. It was so hard to be so vulnerable. But it was like a weight was lifted off my shoulders knowing that I wasn't the only one who knew what I was dealing with. And I hope it's the same way for you. I wish you the best of luck.

2560,"basketball_is_life","comment","","Hi there,nnI got a couple questions for you. What were your specific triggers when you had severe social anxiety? What were your first step towards recovery? Did you ever go to therapy and how did it go? What made the biggest difference in boosting your self esteem?nnI'm 22 years old and have had enough of social anxiety and how it has controlled my life up until this point. I want to finally take steps towards defeating my anxiety rather than just coping with it. However, with this decision I realize I'm going to have to face my fears head on now, which is a terrifying realization because for years I've avoided my triggers at all costs. So I guess I'm just looking for a general idea of how you overcame your anxiety. Thanks!"
2564,"basketball_is_life","comment","","That sounds awful what you're going through. And it's especially awful that your family seems to be making the problem worse. High school was a really difficult period of my life as well. I was really anxious all the time and bullied nearly every day. It was so bad that I would rather sit in the bathroom stall during my lunch period than eat in the cafeteria. I'd also skip every single presentation in class because I had no confidence in my abilities to speak in front of anyone, let alone the whole class. I just hated everything about me; I was skinny, short, had lots of pimples, turned red easily, the list went on and on. I thought of committing suicide nearly every night. One night, a night that I remember very vividly, was when I looked into how tall the Golden Gate bridge was in San Francisco and what the success rate of suicide jumpers was. I was so, so low. But, and I don't know how I did it, but I just kept pushing through. I kept fighting.nnThat was a little over 7 years ago. I'm 22 now and finally looking to get help for my anxiety and depression problems. For so long I'd been successful in pushing my problems further and further into myself, coping with the problem rather than fighting it. I simply didn't want to face them. But now that I'm about to dive head first into the real world in a few months I've been looking into going to therapy because damn do I know I need it. I just wish I didn't push away the problem until now. I wish I'd done it much, much sooner. So I guess my advice to you is to seek help now rather than later, no matter how much you might not want to. There are mental health professionals that want to help you become the best version of yourself that you can be.nnI wish you the best of luck and I'm rooting for you!"
2569,"basketball_is_life","comment","","Hey, I was just summoned as well. I was supposed to appear January 8th but I postponed it online to later next year. Apparently (at least in the state of Oregon) you are allowed the opportunity to postpone your duty to a later date one time. You are also allowed to not attend if you feel there may be an issue.nnYou should definitely check with your therapist. Try to get a written note that describes your condition and how you wouldn't be fit to be in the selection pool. Then I'd suggest calling the court you're supposed to appear in and let them know of your issue. They'll then be able to guide you in the right direction.nnHope this helps."
2572,"basketball_is_life","comment","","Happy birthday. I hope you're able to do something fun for yourself today.nnI just want to tell you that I feel your pain. Social anxiety is a real pain in the ass to deal with. You want friends but at the same time you don't. It just doesn't make any sense. I've pushed away so many people just because I didn't want to put in the effort and I was too scared to sustain a friendship. As a result, my only true friend is my cousin who is the exact same way. I don't have any friends besides family. And it's an awful feeling. I want friends to hangout with, to go to concerts with, to play video games with, but I just can't seem to take that next step into actually making and keeping friends. I'm too scared and my self esteem is too low to even try.nnBut I don't want to keep living this way so I'm planning on making some serious changes this upcoming year. I'm going to push myself to get uncomfortable. Instead of coping with the anxiety I'm going to try to defeat it head on. I've never gone to therapy but I'm going to schedule a session beginning of the year. Am I nervous? Scared of what's to come? Hell yeah I'm scared and nervous. But I'd rather travel into the unknown than stay where I'm at if it means having even the tiniest of chances of defeating social anxiety.nnAnyways, I'm sorry you feel lonely on your birthday. Birthday's can be difficult. I know mine is too. If you need anyone to message I'm here for you. And sorry this post is a bit scrambled, I do that sometimes :p"
2573,"basketball_is_life","comment","","You're welcome! I'm glad they were understanding of your situation and allowed you the time to get that letter from your therapist.

I've never gone to therapy before and I'm really nervous about everything. But I'm hoping that by pushing myself bit by bit I'll be able to gain some much-needed self confidence. "
2574,"basketball_is_life","comment","","Perhaps as a last ditch effort you could call the number on the letter the court sent you and explain your predicament to them? Let them know of your anxiety issues and how you've been seeing a therapist but don't think you'd be able to handle all that came with jury duty at this particular time. Idk if it'll work but I guess it's worth a shot if you feel as though you wouldn't be able to go. Certainly the court wants a person who can focus completely on the trial at hand and a person with mental health issues (like me and you) wouldn't be able to give 100% to the cause.nnI'm sorry for what you're going through. This kind of a problem seems so irrational to people that don't have social anxiety. I hope you're able to get out of it but even if you don't just remember that it's only a moment in time that will eventually pass and be over with. I wish you the best of luck."
2594,"XIsACross","comment","","You need both. You need to experience social situations to be able to challenge your fear of them, but you need cognitive change to challenge your perception of what actually happened in the event, and what people actually thought of you. A lot of the time we often believe people judged us more than they actually did, and we need to cognitively make arguments for whether or not people actually judged us. At the same time, we actually need to experience those situations so that we can put those logical thoughts into action, and prove to ourselves that we can successfully talk to people.nnEdit : personally I think that exposure in indeed more important. Before I went to therapy people used to tell me that it was the most important thing I should do, but even though exposure helped, sometimes exposing myself to my fears in the wrong way would actually make my anxiety worse. When I went to therapy I learned about the process of changing my mind and the importance of being able to actually INTERPRET the situations I am in correctly, and that massively improved my ability to overcome my anxiety in situations of exposure, and to take much more away from those situations so that I was less scared next time. I think the average person only has experience of overcoming relatively minor fears using exposure, and so recommend it to people with actual anxiety disorders. The problem is that while exposure is usually helpful even for people with strong anxieties, if done in the wrong way it can make a person's anxiety worse. "
2595,"Sopel97","comment","","You may be able to better tell who can be trusted, who wants to really support you, and who is there just because you go to the same school. It will show who can understand that some people have problems they can't themselves imagine and their reaction can show their true attitude towards you. People act diffent in such public environments, they may tell much more than they would in person. How much it means depends heavily on your past interactions with them and what you actually wrote, but you can always get something valuable from such exposures.

I found a group for people with social anxiety but it isn't very active (go figure!) and another group for people with anxiety and depression which has more events. Hopefully I can gather the courage to make it to one of their events!nnMay I ask, have you ever tried exposure therapy? That's what I'm hoping to try soon and I'm terrified lol"

I'm from the UK, and I have been through situations that are sort of similar because I grew up in Wales but went to university in England. People from Wales get 2/3 of their student debt paid off by the Welsh government, so I have about a third the student debt that everyone else around me has. I have had quite a few conversations with people about it where they are a little bit jealous of me having so much less student debt, but never jealousy in a serious or personal attack sort of way, more jokey or banter-y way if anything. However, if you aren't from the UK, the UK does have a system where student loans aren't really treated as real loans, unlike say, the US system, and so aren't nearly as stressful as I'm sure they can be in many countries.

Trembling followed with increase heart rate, always looking to see if others are starring at me, feeling judged by everyone around me, telling myself to breath in and out and then looking awkward because of it, and my voice gets a higher pitch when Im in a social environment. n2. Idk about low point but I have had these symptons since i turned 22 and I am now 24. n3. I used a lot of Alcohol to cope with it, which is the worst thing you can do because its just a temporary fix and once the alcohol is gone you are back to being anxious. Not only that but weight gain can result from drinking too much and eating too much just to cope with it.n4. Nope and nope, but I might have to seek therapy even though Im kinda anxious just thinking about seeing a doctor... n5. I was that guy in High school and college who would go to all the house parties, clubs, festivals and would put myself out there.

The best thing you can do is explain to your parents that it's not just a phase and that its something your really struggling with. Ask them if you can get help from a psychiatrist. nnWeather or not that works you need force yourself to socialize with anyone you can and try learning to enjoy it. When I was about 14 I made a promise to myself that I would become friends with everyone in my class. By the end of the year it worked, I was friends with almost everyone in my class and I was a completely different person.nnI'm 19 now and social anxiety is something I still struggle with very much but I don't think its something you can ever really cure. As long as you try you'll just get better and better at socializing, it might not ever feel good enough and you might not feel like everyone else but all you can do is hang on there and enjoy the good bits, the more you try the more good bits there will be."

First will help you detach your own cognitions from those stemming from childhood trauma. And trance techniques help you forgive your parents ""in the past"". Act of forgiving is very powerful - your parents are just humans, imperfect like anyone, they've only done what they've could've done, and you still forgive them. From that sort of act you reclaim your personal worth and power, since their harmful actions are forgiven and no longer linger over you. nnNot going to dive deeper (whole books been written on this topic), it's better to work it out with good therapist.

You somehow think in framework of ""worthy not worthy"" where people need to be of certain quality or goodness or do something to deserve love/respect and so on.

You need to work with a therapist about your core values, because if you process your potential interaction with a woman on a street, you are going to think in terms of that ladder or hierarchy, and think that long enough you start feeling shame, and won't even look at them, because it's like constant reminder of your position (on your imaginary ladder).

3140,"rosebudpng","comment","","As someone else mentioned, I think part of the anxiety for me as a person in their 20's (and it sounds like the same for you) is that there is the pressure to ""live your life to the fullest"" in your teens and 20's. And while that would be the ideal, it's not always feasible for someone dealing with anxiety and depression or other mental health issues. It's important to recognize that the things that people without these added pressures can do is not necessarily achievable for you right now, and that's not necessarily a bad thing; everyone goes at their own pace, and everyone needs help doing it. Therapy is (slowly) helping me come to terms with that.nnHave you talked with your 3 friends about your struggles with anxiety? I've lost friendships as well because of my anxiety and depression, and the emotional breakdowns that resulted from it. A lot of them ended due to a lack of proper communication because of said issues. Maybe having an honest dialogue with your pals will help take off some of the weight of feeling like a ""nightmare."""

Shame of being imperfect - who was the first who gave you that thought that you have to be exceptional to be accepted (while others are accepted for just who they are)?

Root cause is you judging yourself.  n n3. Also shame - since you can't accept yourself as a good person, you setup a bargain scheme, good for good, which of course is not a viable. Showing off is you putting on a protective mask - you want to have some good emotions for once, some fun, but since you are judging yourself as a bad person, the one way to have fun is ti pretend or put on the mask. The mask is not you - so it can act more freely. That's a coping mechanism - you want to feel positive emotions, but since you are rendering yourself guilty, only some alter-ego can have fun.  nnnSo the root question may be - who was the first one to make you feel like you are bad person and you've accepted it as a truth?

Once you get awareness of your anxiety, and I mean you really will start to see from where it's coming, what are it's roots, you will also become aware of thoughts, and emotions it generates.

That’s the trick to social anxiety though, and the fact that you caught that is a sign that you’re fighting anxiety and making progress on it. nAs for your your therapist, my opinion is that saying one isolated thing like this is not enough to stop seeing him, but it should cause you to be aware of what he tells you and take things with a grain of salt if need be.

I purposely went for a job a few months back, that I knew was only a fixed term of 3 months with the possibility of extension, because I knew if it was horrible I wouldn't have to go beyond 3 months. There was such a mix of us there; a 17 year old girl, 19 year old guy, five or six 50+ women, three 40 year olds and myself (26F). But I felt so out of place, most of them knew each other well whilst myself and another woman were new. nnShe got on so well with everyone, whilst I was placed next to this rather miserable, gossipy woman, who seemed to subconsciously look down upon my 'too overly nice for my own good' attitude. My social anxiety often makes me be really overly smiley and scared to say anything controversial, or say anything that might invite them to ask me more about my personal life. I tend to be very closed off about my personal life as I'll admit, I'm embarrassed by a lot of it and scared to look like a loser. Especially seeing the outgoing 17yr old girl getting on so well with people 30 yrs older put me off, because I realised I was in the middle and the outsider. nnI prayed for calls to come through (it was a call centre type job setting) because talking to strangers on the phone was somehow easier than being around those colleagues. One day, I was at a computer in the corner and the whole lot of them were laughing and joking with each other whilst I barely said a word, I then was forced to ask the miserable lady for advice regarding a phone call and she gave this microexpression of 'Oh god, here she is bothering me again, won't talk unless it's work related'. Everyone went silent and I just wanted the ground to swallow me up. Thankfully the new job contracts were not renewed due to funding so I didn't have to carry on there. nnBeing part of a group whether socially or at work has never been my forte, as you can tell haha.nnYou sound like a competent young woman who can do the job, and the fact you're going to therapy is really commendable. Don't give up, unfortunately I've struggled a lot in my early twenties with jobs but there's still time for you to make the best of those years.

I dont know a whole lot about it, since i never actively seeked help, but try and see what works for you. Try therapy, theres even group classes geared towards bringing people with social anxiety together so you can work on socialising with people who are just as anxious as you. Slowly try to put yourself out there, even if its something small like buying something yourself. Try out new hobbies, have fun, and it doesnt necessarily have to be something that involves being around other people. nnIn terms of uni and work, i found that for me im having an easier time doing it because theyre both centred around things im very passionate about.

I’ve learned that I will never be fully happy about it and not care, it will always be on my mind, so the only thing I can do is learn to accept myself and realize my insecurities and weaknesses will not go away. Spending time thinking about them and wishing they would change and how happy I’d be if they did when they can’t makes things worse, so i have to accept that i am the way I am and live with it. The thing that helps me most and what i believe is the key to finding your self purpose is to identify and focus on your strengths and the things you’re far better than the average person and use your energy to be the best at that you can be, and this will give you confidence in yourself."

I also have super wide hips like a girl as well which was even worse. Before I started lifting was the worst because I was skinny so you could see my weird bone structure easily. Sophomore year of high school I started lifting consistently and I grinding that for a solid year and half hard. Went from 133 lbs to 185lbs. Shoulders chest, and back widened out a shit ton and created more of v-shape going to my wide hips and butt than before. Felt wayyyy more confident and happy with my body. Took a little break from lifting when I started college (I’m 19 rn), but got back into it heavy this April and worked out from then till August and had a decent diet. Got into really good shape and my shoulders widened out more than ever and made my hips and ass seem less big. nnI still wasn’t able to shrink my hips or butt and shit that’s just bone structure but by bulking up and lifting it looks more like you’re just a big, wide, strong bodied guy instead of a guy with girl hips and buff lmao. People guessed I was like 195-200 lbs when i was more like 180 (still noticeably strong and lean though).nnIf you tell me how old you are I’ll be about to give you advice on routine as you are a noob like you said. This really helped me and my self confidence a lot as I did not like my body for the same reasons as you. I promise you if you put in the work you will get a lot of confidence in yourself."

I had to accept myself as my own real friend. I used to struggle with anxiety but I've kinda overcome that, and other issues. also I can see not talking at all as an issue unless you want to talk, I used to hate talking and being forced to interact with others in school because I was not comfortable, but the more I've done it throughout the years, I almost have no issues talking to people today; avoiding makes it worse/prevents you from getting better at it"

I told my doctor about my problem and he put me on a small dose of lexapro (a common starting place for anxiety medication). It can take around eight weeks to feel the full affects, but after three, I can say I’ve definitely been in better moods and I’m a little more outgoing in social situations. I’m not really a fan of taking medications long term, but if it helps, I’m for it. Unfortunately there are a lot of possible side affects with lexapro. Fortunately for me, so far, I’ve only experienced the most common one...lasting longer in bed lol.nnAnxiety medication isn’t the answer though. It definitely helps, but it’s just a bandaid. I’m seeing a therapist to try to conquer the anxiety, not just numb it. I’d suggest considering doing the same."
3835,"LiterallyAGhost_","comment","","This is a post I could have written myself when I was 18. I'm 21 now and I'm doing a lot better. I still don't have tons of friends and I still spend too much time depressed and laying in bed. I still have never had anything even resembling a romantic experience before. But back then I felt like a worthless, unlovable, disgusting piece of dirt. I wanted to die and sometimes still do. I wondered why God was cruel enough to make me. On top of that, in my family life I was surrounded by perfect siblings with good grades who were also social butterflies. I wondered what was wrong with me. Why am I like this? Why am I this broken abomination?nnI never sought help until a doctor told me I needed to go to therapy for depression a few months ago. The therapist gave me a new way of looking at things. You feel like dirt because you see people enjoying life while you don't. Ask yourself what you might say to someone else who feels the same way you do. Odds are you might show them sympathy and tell them that their situation is relatable. You might reassure them and tell them things can get better. Or maybe you'll tell them that it's OK if they don't go on dates and party all them time. Now ask yourself why you don't give these same answers to yourself.nnFor me, a big part of my depression was that I had been conditioned by myself and the people around me to believe that I was ""supposed"" to be doing all the cool college shit that supposedly everyone does. I had been told that in college everyone has tons of friends and getting an SO is super easy. When that didn't happen, I plummeted into depression because I believed something must have been wrong with me. Over time I came to realize that it's normal and OK to struggle. It's normal and OK to not be where you want to be. Sometimes the things we think that we are ""supposed"" to be or ""should"" be really aren't true at all.nnI hope my explanation wasn't too rambly.

(“I have less of it compared to even the average person”) because that would be ground-breaking, in fact, there is no method that has been shown to “cure” this disorder not even with CBT. nnSocial anxiety is complex, it has many factors that contribute to the over-sensitivity of the brain’s fear centre such as to much serotonin production and the higher nerve activity in the amygdala (emotions) which is often the case with sufferers of SA and is the reason you should seek both doctors and psychologists to be evaluated and treated accordingly.

I went to countless training sessions and matches against other teams during this time. At the end of the year we had a ceremony in which all families of the team gathered and each player stood in a line on an elevated stage and our coach that had been training us for the entire year started handing out a medal one by one and then somehow (I still don’t understand how it was possible) he forgot or just didn’t give me a medal so I just stood there empty handed whilst everyone else in my team were holding their medals up in the air for their families to see and cheering. Then when we walked off the stage and back to our families I remember my friends dad asking me with this worried or almost shocked face “Didn’t you get one \[my name\]?” and I could instantly feel my emotions overwhelming me and I was just like “nope” and I don’t really remember more from that day, sort of suppressed it. (I just felt betrayed by my teacher which I very much liked and sort of looked up to, I've struggled with SA before that time tho but I think that really helped fuel it.)nnTLDR: Was part of a football team (10 years old at the time), coach forgot to give me my medal at end of year when everyone was watching and it ruined me."

I haven't gotten a clear diagnosis on what it exactly is but it is either depression, social anxiety, autism or a mixture of all of them. Don't know for sure.nnI started going to counseling begining this year because I had a breakdown phase at the end of last year and it was not the first time but the first time I am financially capable of getting help. nnThe first session was mainly introduction. She told me what she studied and how her therapy works and I explained why I reached out for counceling and explained briefly who I am and what I do. The following week we started with my family tree and the relationships I have with the people in my live. I always thought yeah it was not soo bad and other people probably had it worse but my first session we talked about family I started sobbing about a topic I thought was not a big deal at all. The third session we mainly talked about what happend the week before, how I felt during the week and why that happend. The 4th week we continued with the familly tree. Last week we started with my ""life line"". We talk about how I grew up, ho school was like, what I used to do, who my friends were and so on. It's nothing crazy yet but it helps her to understand who I am and why I am how I am.nnEven if I just had about 5 sessions yet we already filpped some stones and I really think we are getting somewhere. Not like ""hey you're cured and life is perfect now"". But in a better direction. My psychologist helps me to cope with feelings and how to approach situations and explains to me why I might feel how I feel and links that to my stories about childhood and fears and stuff and it really helps to calm down in situations where I usually get anxious, clamed up or can't think of anything to say.nnMost of them know what they are doing and will try to find out how to help you best and even if it just gets a little bit better it is still a piece of life quality you might gain out of it."

I was doing science bachelor in the first one (I’m from Spain), and I wanted to change to the arts bachelor. In the second high school, people were great since day 1, and one of my best friends now (met her in 2016-2017).nnOn 1st year of college, class was great too, but I felt weird because I had never had a bf. Friends there were good and still maintain some of them (but only online because it’s a bit far from where I live now), but I didn’t like that studies so much (Audiovisuals) and changed to Graphic Design in another city.nn1st year of GD was good at first, but then I felt anxious, coped with some personal issues, also insecurities. Then I isolated from people and I was a bad friend to some people that was very nice to me. Felt bad but I wasn’t capable of saying sorry. I was so anxious.nnNow I am on 2nd year and I finally said sorry to that person, stopped being as introverted as before (but still), talked more... but met new people this year and some of them were awful. They discovered and told everyone private things about me and 9o% were lies, and those which weren’t, were exaggerated. I didn’t go to class a lot this year, I will fail at least 3 or 4 classes. People that I found nice hate me because the stupid other people call me weird and  lot of bad rumors. Of course, I met great people too, but it is terrible to see that people now hates you and treats you as if you were crazy or stupid. And yea, I have friends, but I’m still alone, if you get me.

4283,"AA9920","comment","","So the therapy itself I started last year and I'm still in recovery so I still got anxieties left in me but I'm working on them as well, but it certainly doesn't necessarily take a whole year to deal with overcoming social anxiety. The duration of how long it takes to overcome your anxiety is totally dependent upon how aggressive you push it in the exposure therapy. I mean, I reckon you could perhaps totally overcome social anxiety in 3 months if you really really push with the exposure therapy and don't hold back. But yeah, the bottom line is there's no definite time when you'll get better, it all depends on the person and I guess how disciplined they are in their exposure work. So for me, literally just like 3 months ago, I was still relatively deep in social anxiety, so I feel that the bulk of the anxiety has been removed just in these last 3 months, because that was when I was really really pushing it with the exposure therapy as hard as I could. How has life changed? Well, you basically see the world more for what it is, which is that it's not really scary at all, like all those people you meet are literally people just like you and when you're in recovery from social anxiety, you can really see that clearly in front of your eyes and you're baffled by how you were so scared all this time. But the brain is so powerful, it makes non-threatening situations feel so threatening and when you have social anxiety, I suppose you just view the world through a kind of scary, grotesque and distorted filter but that filter is just an illusion. Thanks for the comment btw."
4285,"AA9920","comment","","Exposure therapy is certainly effective, however I feel like there's one part of exposure therapy which is ABSOLUTELY key in overcoming anxiety disorders, which is response prevention; so you must firstly expose yourself to the thing that causes you anxiety, BUT the most important part is to do response prevention, which is to not respond with relief seeking behaviours, such as rumination, analysing, reassurance or anything and just let the anxiety be there; it is in letting the anxiety be there that the brain is given a chance to habituate to the anxiety and for it to go down over time and thus recovery is made. Also, for people with social anxiety, they can't be told that their fears are irrational because most of them know this. The problem doesn't lie in intelligence but rather in emotions, a bit like being scared of a spider, like you know logically it won't cause any harm to you, but it just feels sooo scary, so they need to kill the fear by facing it directly and raw. Also, about you not being able to voice your opinions, oooh man, I can soo relate to that. I just want to say something to others but every fibre in my body's telling me that something horrible will happen to me if I do, so I would just keep my mouth shut. But absolutely you can get better. These fears destroyed my life from like 5 till 20 years old, which is what I am now. I do still get waves of anxiety but now I know what to do with them, which is to not engage with them. Anyway hope you get better. 100% you are not doomed to live with social anxiety for the rest of your life, change can be made. It happened to me, so it's more than possible."
4354,"DoveNacht","comment","","Hi I am an 18 y.o female. I didn't speak throughout all my childhood. I was diagnosed with severe social anxiety (mutism) at age 6, I went through a lot of physical/sexual abuse and bullying which amplified everything. I didn't have friends until my teenage years came around, I started off whispering then talking but with a lot of stuttering but now I can speak normally. I was able to achieve this with a high dose of zoloft and a lot of therapy. I can now speak to only close friends without stuttering or having a panic attack at the moment. I want to be normal, I want to make new friends but it's so hard. I've had guys ask me out a lot but this was only when I was at my worst with anxiety. Quarantine has been awful with the problem I have. I've been trapped inside my own dreams and I can't escape unless I can face reality again. I'm now craving real life social interaction and it's so strange. I just wanted to share this because i'm at a low point and I need some kind of outlet."
4405,"AA9920","comment","","If you are to heal from social anxiety, you must completely cut out all ruminative behaviours, this means analysing, reassurance seeking and general rumination. These are all relief seeking behaviours, which will make you feel better in the short term but in the long term just exacerbate the anxiety. So you must cut all of this out, which will be somewhat painful, however just sit with that anxiety raw and let it be there and let it play itself out and then because it can't stay there forever, it will tire and go away and your social anxieties will eventually become almost extinct. That is not to say it won't ever come back. I think because you have an overanalytical brain, triggers will always come back from time to time but if you do this, which is ERP therapy constantly, then it will become eventually second nature to you and you will be able to live a life pretty much free of anxiety, though maybe not completely.  Also, there are other things you can do that will allow to even be free of triggers, such as eating well, exercising, sleeping well. Because sleep deprivation from what I've read is a huge trigger for anxiety and so if you aren't well rested, your anxiety spikes will come back much more intensely than they would with a good night's rest. So if you keep these factors in mind, I don't anxiety will really affect you at all, you'll be able to live just a good a life as someone without any anxiety issues."

4505,"War_Luigi","comment","","What I can definitely recommend is going to a psychotherapist. Your mental health is at least as important as your physical health. It is especially difficult nowadays to have the courage to go to a psychotherapist, because it somehow has such a negative connotation in our society.  Like just because I see a doctor for mental health doesnt mean Im mentally broken, retarded, depressed or anything. People even go to psychotherapists just to have someone to talk to about their everyday casual problems.nnAnd I also dont mean you should take medicine, I would even advise against that. A psychotherapist will simply talk to you about your social anxirty, finding out where it came from and how to work on it step by step. nnAfter years of trying and ups and downs I found out that I am simply not able to fix this problem for myself. Psychotherapy can help you fix that once and for all!nnOf course its not going to be easy, but I think its the best shot. What do you think about it?"

I'm 21 and I totally relate the state you are in. I was always quiet and an extreme introvert . When I was 12 , I had gone through Chemotherapy and it totally messed up my thought process and hormonal balances. All of a sudden , I was a fat thin haired nerdy looking introvert. I couldn't talk to anyone after the treatment also because I had not much interest in communicating with people. Somehow I got good in studies( maybe I found my comfort zone here) . Then I joined college far from my home just to gain some communication skills. It didn't work out much but I learned a lot things to a point where atleast my roommates know what I am and what I can achieve.nnIt's really hard to digest when you hear that"" you're very quiet"" , "" speak louder"" , ""don't be antisocial"" , "" don't be shy"" , "" I didn't see you , were you here all the time?"" bs. My parents are worried that I ""can't live life"" with how I am doing. Except in communication skills and social anxiety , I feel very proud of myself with my knowledge because sadly I'm the only one who knows what I can do though people can only see my Other side and judge on it.I feel motivated these days and I love learning things that I don't know .nnI'm so used to overthinking now. I liked thinking about things and getting knowledge was fun but with my nervousness added it has turned to anxiety and am depressed for almost 7 years. Almost to a point where I like getting depressed because it's the only thing I can fully feel.nnI started exercising and lost weight which really helped gain back my confidence . Now I'm adding meditation in my schedule to balance my mental stress and anxiety. I've also learned not only ""you think so you are ""  but also "" what you eat is what you are"".nI'm so excited for my future-self social being after I overcome anxiety and be able to express without being shy.nnAnyway, thank you so much for your time reading this .

It's the imperfections--the vulnerabilities, the weaknesses, the human elements--that make us who we are, that make us real, beautiful . . . necessary.” - Guy Harrison nnI was like you at some point in my life. However, this was something I thought about that helped me find my purpose in life: the harsh reality of life is people come and go. I knew that if I died while being blinded by my insecurities and going nowhere in life, I would only be known as the quiet kid from high school since I have accomplished nothing good. I would recommend investing your time in a hobby you are passionate about (I highly recommend PC gaming since video games can help keep your mind away from life). Also seeing how you have regrets, that is a good thing. Learn from your past to become a better person  (become a humble person), if that makes sense. Treat others the way you want to be treated. Keep in mind that you are definitely not alone. Together we can both kick our insecurities in the ass. What are you insecure about? Your looks?"
4645,"polydipsia1","comment","","I’m 24 and I met criteria for social anxiety disorder when I was in high school and college. When you’re 15 and have social anxiety, it feels like the focus of your entire life when you’re old and looking back on your life will be high school. I mean that’s what it seems like in the movies. That’s not true at all. In fact, as you grow older and people become more mature and accepting of themselves, you realize the degree to which everyone has problems and doesn’t have life figured out. Most people in high school are too afraid to be vulnerable for you to see that, and it can seem like you’re the only one having problems and feeling left out.nnWhen you have social anxiety, it also feels like everything is your fault when somebody says no to to being or friend or getting in a relationship with you. However, there’s no such thing as a girl that is objectively better or worse than other girls. Some guys like girls that are shy and anxious and think that it’s super cute (although also sometimes the thought that the other person thought you were awkward or anxious is just your social anxiety talking). People have different preferences. Inevitably, you will reject people and people will reject you. And that’s ok. It happens to everyone because nobody is liked 100% of the time. Also, I agree with not sticking around that guy because 1) it’s mentally unhealthy and 2) he might use you as a meat backboard if things don’t work out with the current girl because that’s what teenagers do and you deserve better than that.nnFinally, if you truly feel that social anxiety is having a negative impact on your life and functioning, that’s the time that you should ask your parents if you can see a therapist. Therapy truly changed my life and social anxiety is one of the most treatable conditions. I waited until I went to college and I wished that I had it sooner when I was in high school. There’s no shame in going, and anyone who says otherwise is truly ignorant about mental health. Good luck to you, and the pain from this guy will go away and eventually be nothing as you move on with your life and find many more guys."

Our SA pales in comparison to the thousands of people being diagnosed with a terminal illness or life altering condition."
4648,"islandwalking","comment","","To be honest I’ve never been evaluated for it, but yea I have all of those symptoms too. If you wanna be evaluated you’ll just have to force yourself to get it done (I know it’s not easy). Honestly not exactly sure how they address social anxiety either as I’ve always been treated for general anxiety. nnDon’t let your fear of a depression diagnosis scare you off too much though, it could help maybe. It’s scary but incredibly helpful to dive deep into your trauma or past, and understand why you feel the way you do now. nnBy the way, you should be very proud of yourself for sharing how you feel, I know exactly how terrifying that is and it’s a huge step in the right direction. I highly recommend journaling everything you feel as a release, no one but you has to see it, but it feels really good. You are not alone, as cheesy as that sounds, just know it’s true as fuck."
4730,"WesternNinja0","comment","","Well I guess it depends on the sub. The sub in question was r/AskFeminists. I told them how I heard that two men who go to my college raped people and I asked what I should do about it. They removed it saying I was trying to get free therapy from the sub to relieve guilt. I just wanted to know what they thought I should do in the situation. Luckily I got some good responses before the mods removed it.nn&amp;#x200B;nnSometimes the mods will remove for weird reasons, but you can also get decent advice from users before that happens. Good luck, reddit can be hard to post on."
4751,"War_Luigi","comment","","Whoa man, that story sounds rough and I can imagine that you only scratched the surface and could talk about it for hours. My current situation at work with social anxiety is exactly the same as yours and it can be hard to cope with it at times. Not being able to be the person you want and at the same time not being able to accept yourself is one of the worst feelings and it seems both you and me have that problem. Same problem when I was young and in school. It is interesting to see how children find ways to cope with it - for you it was that 'tough guy' personality which I can understand. For me I tried to be a class clown. I couldnt really talk with girls or anyone outside my close friend group, so I tried to be like the foolish guy (who is unpredictable as well).nnInstead of compensating with alcohol, I compensated with video games. One might say that it isnt as bad, and to some extent that is true, but I got addicted hard and still am. It was the only place I could feel comfortable and became so addicted that it made the problem only worse and I got less and less social.nnIm 23 right now and its not getting any better, I also have the feeling that my friend group doesnt really really care about me. They are nice people, but nobody would take a hit for me.nnI feel you 100%. But it sounds like at least you got out of your depression and alcohol addiction. You reflected on yourself and that is a huge step in the right direction. As to how to solve our problems - I dont know. I dont want to keep living like this but it seems impossible to change anything. Would you recommend seeing a psychotherapist to me? And have you thought about your next steps on how to improve?"

4851,"yuccamelon","comment","","All of the above. I love outside but even taking a walk around my neighborhood is nervewracking for me. There's always the off chance a man will try to approach me, ask for money or something even though I don't have any. Also just feels like people are staring at me any time I'm in public. Like I feel like I can't even conduct myself around people most of the time. It takes days of mental preparation for me to have interactions with anyone other than my boyfriend. I'm really lucky I have him at least. nnI'm also unemployed right now, been unemployed this whole year, feeling like a huge failure. I just graduated last year and did one internship, but nothing after that. I constantly feel disappointed in myself but at the same time terrified of going through all the interview processes. Zoom stuff is just as scary if not scarier than real life interviews for me. nnAfter dealing with so many phonecalls and appointments I finally got my ADHD medication again yesterday after being unmedicated since around March. It's honestly been the biggest struggle for me jumping through all these hoops with insurance and doctors after my previous doctor had to close his office. Being medicated vs not is the difference between actually being able to focus on tasks longer than 5 minutes vs flitting from one thing to another and ultimately accomplishing nothing at the end of the day."
4862,"SnooStrawberries9660","comment","","hi! i'm 21f, first of all i'm really sorry :( at least you're of legal age to get medical help on your own, so please don't worry about what your parents think because you don't legally need them for this. although it would be really helpful to have parents who care and understand (more than helpful, and it's really fucking sad that they don't ""believe"" in mental health disorders) it might be beating a dead horse if you talk to them and they still don't understand. please know you're not alone at least, and your problems are very valid. don't let them tell you otherwise. nni'm not sure where you live, but at least right now in america, all of my therapy appointments are over telephone due to covid. that will make it much, much easier. if not, you can most definitely request to do phone appointments!!! that is probably the best advice i can give, and it's what helped me. i wish you the best of luck &lt;3"
4865,"duncino12","comment","","Hey, I totally understand what you're going through. I'm 24 and I've been dealing with social anxiety since I was a teenager. The constant feeling of loneliness and rejection really ate away at my confidence and my mental health and created a feeling that I don't really belong anywhere. nnWhat helped me was just realizing that I can't be my own worst enemy. I had to choose to be my biggest supporter and not get down on myself when one interaction didn't go the way I wanted it to. One thing that really helped me was doing things to build my self-confidence. I don't know if you workout but for me personally that helped a lot and I started to feel better about myself. I also began saying positive affirmations to myself. I would start off the day by saying all the negative thoughts that I had about myself and then immediately countering them all with positive words and phrases. One example would be that I don't have any friends and I would counter this by saying that I have developed meaningful and fulfilling friendships in my life. This did wonders for me when I felt rejected because I was telling myself all the ways I'm worthwhile and I highly suggest looking into it and starting it yourself.nn Additionally, I found it helpful to lean on other people that I could really trust when I was getting really down on myself due to loneliness and rejection. At times this was my family and close friends and at others, it was a therapist. Therapy was really great in dealing with the feelings of loneliness and rejection. Being able to get these feelings and thoughts out of the echo chamber of my head was extremely helpful. One thing my therapist suggested to me was to slowly expose myself to things that I thought were fearful. It started small with things like making small talk with a cashier and eventually grew into exposure to rejection. nnId also try joining clubs or groups of people that you have common interests with once the pandemic is over. It's a great way to expose yourself to people and an easy way to make small talk and bond because you guys already share a commonality.nnI think the most helpful thing I've learned is that when I get rejected its not my fault and its not because of anything I did. Sometimes it just happens but I have to keep trying and putting myself out there because the feeling of loneliness is way worse. I don't know if any of what I said helped but that's how I've dealt with those feelings. Please feel free to shoot me a message if you'd like."
4882,"Current_Ad347","comment","","Reading what you've said here, it makes a lot of sense. To be honest, I thought the concept of rating interactions as ""good"" or ""bad"" in my head was something only I did 😂nnI have made a few throwaway accounts here on reddit before, making posts about problems I wanted advice for. A few times, I've been told to consider therapy, and I haven't done it so far. But I think your comment has pushed me over the edge to actually do it. I've tried to solve my social anxiety on my own, but it would help tremendously if I got help from someone who is a professional.nnI agree that everyone is pretty much lost in life, trying to figure it all out. I've had that mindset for a little while now and it has definitely helped.nnI actually really enjoyed reading your comment, because I agree with basically everything you've said here. It's kind of confirmed for me that I'm not crazy, and I just have a normal problem, that can be fixed. Even if it might take a while.nnThank you for your advice, it means a lot :)"

I recently went through a bad depressive episode and completely stopped talking to everyone except my boyfriend, and even talking to him took a lot of effort. I live with my parents (I’m 16) so I found myself only wanting to talk to and hang out with them because the thought of being with other people freaked me out.

And no I'm not going elsewhere, you cannot tell me what to do and i don't care in the first place, I'm stating my opinion based on medical facts, you as a ""therapist"" Again i doubt it, should know that the best cure for mental illness such as anxiety is fear exposure.

I try not to mention it because I don’t want to blame all of my behavior on it but you are definitely right I have some mental health issues for sure and it’s still in flux. It doesn’t help that my support system (my parents) are really skeptical of mental health professionals and think it’s more a matter of character and choice. Although they are right in a way. But also my mom doesn’t want me to see a psychiatrist or therapist anymore after having been through a lot of different ones. She is very skeptical about medications and therapy."

When I was a freshman and I got stitches in my pinkie finger every single teacher bent over backwards to make sure I was ok (I was fine, it just made it a bit harder to write). The same year I got a 504 plan for my mental illnesses which included weekly appointments with the school psychologist, and I had a teacher who would fight me on it every time I asked to leave, even though I had a 504 plan and a 98 in her class. It was also embarrassing as hell to have to loudly explain that I needed to see the psychologist"

I have been working on it for 1 year now as I started therapy in November 2020. I have made so much progress, from my anxiety being at an 8-10 when going to shops, driving or speaking in team meetings to it now not really ever going above a 5 for those same things. However since I finished therapy (around March 2021) I am finding that I'm experiencing   regular setbacks, at least one week a month, where I feel like I can't face or do anything, basically how I was pre therapy. I start getting awful physical sensations again from just thinking about doing small tasks i.e. making a phone call or driving somewhere, and I feel like I'm back at square 1. A positive is that these feelings do not last for long periods of time which is a huge improvefor myself (as they were mostly permanent pre therapy) but I guess I'm interesting in knowing is this common for people who are managing their social anxiety and if so how do people handle setbacks or something similar as its really starting to get to me."

The pandemic set me back -  as I've been working remotely and living in my childhood home. So outside of my coworkers and my parents, I didn't really socialize with others. But at the same time, therapy has been really healing, by helping me face the root of my anxiety and self esteem issues. nnI recently accepted an offer for my dream job in NYC, and my first day is tomorrow. I'm from Washington state so I've moved far from my family. I found a great Brooklyn studio and am in love with this area. (My parents grew up in Brooklyn so I am familiar with the area, we'd visit my grandparents here every year until they passed). I'm genuinely excited. I've worked so hard mentally to get to this point.nnI'm so nervous to be around so many new people. Along with the new job, I'm also in a new city. I don't have many friends, and hardly have any in this city, and I want to finally put myself out there.

5054,"taytaylc","post","Thinking about my behavior and how pathetic I am","So I've been known to seek out attention from men especially at night time when I'm alone with my negative thoughts craving for that attention I need. I try to ask for someone to just hangout with me and maybe have a beer and talk and I always feel like I have to give my body in order to just have someone talk to me. It's pathetic and I'm not about that life anymore. I want more than sex. I don't deserve to be treated like a rag doll. It's all what any guy wants. I barely have any friends. I usually seek out men because they will buy me beer so I can quiet my mind and my anxiety. But they always want something in return for getting me beer or buying me shots. I don't have any girl friends because all the girls up here are just like me bad influence and have no respect for themselves and I'm trying to break that pattern. Like last week I hung out with this guy at a bar and at the end of the night he pressured me like I had to give something in return for me being in his presence. That's not how it should be....it seems like no matter how much I say no and make it obvious I always end up disappointing someone always. someone always doesn't get what they want at the end of the night. So I guess I need to throw myself on the line in order to gain friendship huh. My physical body on the table. Such bullshit. Society is screwed up and respect is thrown out the far window. Eventually the night always ends.....I have to give in order for someone to just have a beer with me and talk to me like a human being! How sad is that shit?! I feel so low and cheap. Ugh idk I'm retarded "
5061,"TristanIsolde25","post","Sex and social anxiety","As a virgin I have been wondering if sex could even be an enjoyable experience for an anxious person, I can't imagine being relaxed enough to enjoy a sexual experience with a woman. A few years ago I did live skype sessions with ladies to try and get a taste of what that anxiety would be like, on some occasions I could function well in regards to blood flow but on one occasion I couldn't get the blood to flow there and all I could see was the woman looking at me and so I made an excuse that someone was at the door and closed the computer. I think there is a chance that for a man like me engaging in his own solo sexual activity would be more pleasurable than activity with a living breathing woman. "

I was on seroquel, lexapro, and something else I can't remember. tried a ton of different long term anxiety pills as well, similar to lexapro. I was on Lexapro the longest and it didn't help my anxiety at all, just made me feel foggy/crazy. I'm almost 19 now and my social anxiety/anxiety in general is constant. The worst part is derealization/depersonalization (haven't driven in two years) and anything social. I try to push myself out there and I might have a job interview soon at Target. It feels like I can barely breathe when I talk to people, and I'm worried about getting fired already (if i'm even hired) for being so quiet/anxious/coming off as rude. I was in trouble all the time at my last job for not talking to customers. Can't be a security guard or a stocker apparently because I'm a girl so I'll probably be on a register which I've never done before. tried to be a cleaning lady at a hotel but not enough experience, plus the hotels are really sketchy here. I've been thinking about starting therapy again and was wondering what everyone's opinion is on benzos? My friend takes them for his anxiety and apparently they give him instant relief. But I'm worried about long term effects.

I feel guilty about it.","So, I'll start off this post by saying that I had a year of being severely agoraphobic (in 2016) and pretty instantaneously got into a tinder relationship a few months after starting to interact with people again. I was doing fine for a while in terms of social interaction but of course it never felt completely comfortable for me again.nnAnyways, after a while I started developing body dysmorphia again (I've struggled with it ever since my mother was diagnosed with cancer and then passed away, sorry for the TMI) and basically feel as if everybody is judging how I look and thinking negatively about me as a person. This has caused a great complex in my relationship with my boyfriend and myself due to the fact I basically stay inside his room and minimally interact with his room mates when they are home. I'm pretty cordial when I see them, but I really can't stand being around people for too long or I get horrendously nervous and self aware. Anyways, I feel hella guilty for being this way and I wonder why this man I'm with is choosing to be with this socially awkward chick who isn't ""normal"" enough to literally just talk to people. I pretty much spend all my time with him and here, and I feel super scared and lonely when were not together and we could be (like when he's not working). I realize that co-dependence in general is unhealthy but neither of us are doing anything about it- I like being around him... even though I'm depressed as f*** and I don't really know what I'm living for. Regardless, my social anxiety sucks and I want to know how to deal with this or at least rant about it. How do I get over this fear of needing to be approved of/thinking the world is harshly critical?nnAnyways I feel people think I'm weird looking/look like a tranny but I can't tell if it's in my head. I'm a 22 year old female and I just am hella uncomfortable with my appearance- like I don't see many girls who look like me, and that makes me feel really nervous and sad.nnnSooo TL;DR: I basically live at my boyfriends house and am literally scared of most social interaction, including with his room mates. I isolate myself in their house, and I don't know how to get over this feeling of being hella weird and detached. n"

As soon as I started highschool I got severe acne that completely robbed me of my confidence and identity. In middle school I was so outgoing. DAted the prettiest girls, was the most popular kid and I'm not even just saying that. At 16 I went on accutane and my face cleared up but it was too late. I  was a completely different person and had already isolated myself for about a year. The rest of highschool was miserable. I dropped out my senior year because I was so depressed I couldn't even go. I got my diploma online and now go to community college. I haven't had any friends in years. I haven't talked to a girl since 8th grade. I feel like such a. Fucking loser. I look in the mirror and see a good looking young guy wasting his life away. I watch tv every night and the only person I hangout with is my mom. This depression and social anxiety fucking ruined me and now everyday feels like living in a prison of my own mind. I can't hold a conversation with anyone no less actually connect to someone. I've lived in isolation and self loathing for the past 5 years and I am so ashamed. Because of this I feel like I am constantly putting on an act when talking to anyone besides my mom. I've tried therapy but it definetly doesn't work for me.

5104,"taytaylc","post","Worst night ever","So I decided to go out last night up to Sonora. Which is an hour from where I live. My friend was telling me to come and go bar hopping with him. So we did. And he told me I could crash at his place. Long story short I ended up getting ditched by my friend and was alone all night. I was an hour away from home with nowhere to stay. My friend ditched me probably for another girl. So I was all alone in a back of a bar scared and eventually started panicking and crying. And while this was happening I kept getting hit on by older men. I felt sick to my stomach. I felt stupid and foolish for even going out. I thought he was my friend. But knowing now he is clearly not my friend. Anyways I ended up at a motel paid 100$ for a room and cried all night.  I’ve never felt so stupid and left behind. I wanted to go home but I didn’t want to risk getting a dui no way. So I walked to the nearest motel. I honestly hate people. I’ve never felt so low in my life. I blocked him on Facebook and messaging everything. I deserve more than a disgusting drunk night. I’m tired of being treated like nothing. I think I handled things pretty well for what I was facing but I was still scared. There were creeps around left and right and even one drunk guy randomly got into my car like it was nothing! I was sitting in my car contemplating if I should try to go home or stay at a motel. And he randomly got into my passenger seat. I screamed GET OUT! He could have hurt me. I could have been really hurt out there. Only one guy actually tried to help me. And get me safe somewhere. But just the fact that this guy left me stranded at a drunken bar is NOT ok. You would think he would at least let me sleep on the floor or something! But nooo my safety isn’t important. Fucking bullshit. I need new better friends who support me and want the best. Ughhh I’m still mad at what happened. I’m just glad I didn’t drive home drunk I wouldn’t have gotten far. God was really shielding me last night. And I’m so glad I got home eventually. "

I don't know how to feel about this. On one hand, I'm glad that I went to the doctor because he was so helpful, explaining the symptoms of panic attacks (alkalemia) and how to deal with them and since I was depressed (still am) he also did a diagnosis. But, I feel like I've hit a new low for getting medication. I've just recently moved to a new country and before moving, I was diagnosed with mild social anxiety disorder and the doctor told me that I don't need medication and treatment was possible. But, since it was a bit late, I could only see my doctor one more time before moving. So, on one hand I'm glad, but on the other hand, feel like such a loser because I can't manage this thing and had to resort to medication."

In my first post high school year, I want to change this. I want to seek professional help for my problems, but if only it was that easy.nnIn my City/Country, private Therapy is expensive to say the least. Around $100 plus per hour. I cannot afford such a fee. I want to get a job to cover the fees, but getting a job is extremely daunting for me because of my problems.

I don't ever want them to know that I have problems, hence the reason why I want to get a job. Plus I don't want to add a huge strain on a already very limited family budget. I could go to the public health sector for help, but apparently it is completely useless, overcrowded, underfunded and so on. Plus I honestly don't feel that desperate. Also because I'm 18, I am no longer eligible for subsidised healthcare in my country, so yeah. nnI could go to my tertiary education cancelling service, but my application for my tertiary studies appears to be going nowhere.

Plus I felt like I was wasting time and resources for people who need it more than me. So I stop, but it was nice to talk though. nnYou could recommend me to join a social group. Tried that, didn't help at all. If anything it only reinforced my problems. Just sat there alone as per usual. I don't have the confidence necessary to approach a person. Plus nobody there would actually bothered to talk to me. nnI feel like if I don't do something about my problems, then it will slowly destroy me, and I feel like I have within me all the ingredients necessary for depression.nnIn conclusion, I have quite a dilemma my hands.

Growing up, I've never played with anyone on the playground. I never went to anybody's house or had sleep overs. In high school, I had no one to hang out with. I always sat alone during lunch, if I even ate lunch. I've never been in anybody else's car other than my family's. I've never gone over to a friend's house. And nobody has ever came over to mine.

My situation is not as extreme, but it causes me to come off as awkward and extremely quiet and it’s something I tend to get self conscious about. I feel like me not talking causes conversations to become boring or awkward. When I do speak it is very minimal, I only say cliche terms such as “lit”, “cool”, “nice”, “word”, and a bunch of other terms kids use these days. I try and get myself out there but most of the time I contemplate on what to say and wait too long to speak up and then my time has passed for me to say something. When I am speaking in a group I tend to stay silent and listen and watch everyone else socialize. When I speak my hands tend to get kind of sweaty and I get a little shaky. I talk really quietly and minimal because I am really scared to initiate conversations. I have been to therapy for my social anxiety before and it hasn’t helped me because I feel like my inner self is too scared to speak up and it’s uncontrollable. It’s not like I cannot speak at all, but I wish to speak more and be able to initiate more conversations. I need tips and tricks to help me beat my flight or fight response when somebody talks to me and to be able to speak up and be confident with talking in front of a group of people without getting shaky.

After 7 months I was a bit tired of getting low hours and getting paid minimum wage.nn I got a new job offer at Starbucks and lasted there for 8 months. That job started out ok the first few weeks and went to hell until I quit. My coworkers well most were mean to me. Because I was new and they didn't trust me with most things.

Whenever I did something wrong I'd get cussed at by a coworker or go clean for the rest of my shift while everyone else were gossiping and doing the fun part of the job. I was constantly put down. They'd talk about me in front of me and it just really hurt me. I dreaded coming into work. There were times I'd cry in the back room and coworkers would look at me and quickly leave. I was pushed around. I was told I have no communication skills whatsoever. I never got comfortable with my coworkers. Maybe with one or two. My supervisor knew something was going on and tried to get to the bottom of it but I just said there's just bad days here. I'd cry when I got home. I knew how to do mostly everything it's just I still made a few more mistakes. Manager would also put me down. nnI couldn't handle it anymore so I put in my two weeks. Coworkers asked me why and they'd say they were going to miss me. My trainer told me to not leave and that I was just becoming a great barista. A week later all hell broke loose.

My family isn't very social but rather reserved; social anxiety also runs like a mofo in our genes.  So you can tell where I'm coming from.  As a result, I grew up to be kinda antisocial and only went out with my friends once or twice in the past, mainly in middle school.  Pretty much, I was destined to be a tacit Pakistani engineer that has a six figure job, and a virginity reserved for an arranged marriage at 52.  Now I've been really trying to escape my shell, but it's been backfiring, as if I'm missing a tooth in the key (or some other poetic shit).  Like today, I was walking out of a bathroom stall only to encounter a group of guys huddled up.  I said ""hi"" and they looked at me as if bigfoot just took an epic shit, and said ""um...lets get away from him..."", and darted out.  When I finally develop the courage talk to people, I always come across as condescending and caustic, which is exactly the opposite of how I want to sound.  This causes people to avoid me, like I'm invisible.  When I try to speak in a softer voice, I'm completely inaudible, and my voice becomes a background hum followed by ""what?"", assuming that anyone is actually listening.  When I introduce myself, I'm always awkward no matter how much confidence I'm trying to feign.  If the stars align and someone does respond, it's usually along the lines of ""um...who is this dude and why is he talking to me?""n  The words always come out wrong or as some dumb, incoherent shit.  Every time during a conversation, my mind just goes blank, like a sheet of copy paper.  Talking to girls, as you can see, is a nightmare.

If I don't talk to people, same thing: I'm seen as an arrogant douchebag.n  I can't even smile genuinely.  My mind is always convoluted with random ass shit and what other people think.  Whenever I do smile, people think I'm high and run away.  If I don't, people get intimidated.

I did online classes for a while but depression and anxiety caused me to drop those, and I'm stuck in a place now where i don't feel capable of anything anymore. I want to continue doing them but I'm afraid of what my teachers think of me after all these missed weeks. Plus, other people my age balance part-time jobs, social lives, and going to normal school, while I can't even set foot outside my house sometimes. I feel like a waste of space and a disappointment to my parents, who've given everything to try and help me. I wish I could actually go out and do something with my life, starting with going back to school again. The thing is, I just can't seem to find any motivation or even a reason to get out of bed in the morning sometimes. I've tried meds and therapy but neither have seemed to help and I feel kind of stuck. sorry if this was a bit of a ramble, this is my first post on here and I was pretty reluctant to even write this "

I have almost finished my second year in medical school. Since entering university I've never had any real friends to casually meet up for a specific reason, besides the occasional study group sessions. No one asks about me, nor do I get invited to activities outside of college. I've learned that they've created multiple Whatsapp groups without me in it. That doesn't bother me too much, because I live my life offline (No social media such as Twitter and Snapchat). nnWhen I do sit with my classmates during lunch break. I always feel socially left out, because there isn't a common interest between us besides studying Medicine. During discussions I'm usually in the periphery, because I can't really contribute to the conversations when it comes to anything outside of the profession (e.g Cars, soccer, TV Series &amp; Movies, celebrities, BuzzFeed, multiplayer video games, politics, books, history, and gossips.) nnI'm usually within my own circle of bubble: family, going to the gym, playing singleplayer games from my backlog, studying. I do want to broaden up my general knowledge, so I can feel accepted and be part of the group.nnTl;DR: I want to broaden my general knowledge so I can contribute to discussions, and be invited to activities outside of college."
5283,"madao_irl","post","Today I found the(main) reason behind my severe SA","So the worst part of my SA (which was pointed out too by my therapist) that bothers me a lot is being compared subconsciously with others. Yesterday, I was having a talk (online) with some of my friends who are far away from the city I study. I told them that here people are more open minded in comparison to the city they live(and where I was living for 20 years) at and I have more chances of having an romantic affair here(Well I tried coping with them by saying this, so you could so it is a defensive mechanism of my SA to show people no weakness about myself). Well what was their response? They told me I am a freaking loser, I am ugly and I will forever stay virgin unlike them who lost their virginity in their 18s (We are 20 now). They seemed to humor about it, the sarcastic type of thing.I laughed too, to show I was cool, hurt like hell though. But you know what? Whenever we were together they've always done that. Bringing up their social status in a humoric way and comparing it them with mine. There was always a response from my side, just to cool things off. Yesterday I made this realization. THESE PEOPLE ARE TOXIC as hell that suffer from many insecurities. I was furious today, was gonna cry at some point because of how worthless I felt about me yet again. The worst part is that toxic nature of them influenced my consciousness. I am considering myself toxic sometimes(or I might seem like it). If anyone can share his/her opinion, I will be really glad. Thanks."

A little backstory: I've struggled with both social and general anxiety for as long as I can remember...for most of my life I never even knew what anxiety was. I'm 25 now, and back in school they never taught us about mental health, they kinda touched on it, but I always thought the term ""anxiety"" just meant temporary nervousness. I thought I was a nervous person my whole life, then I discovered anxiety near the end of high school, early college. I still haven't gotten help though, but I'm really struggling as the anxiety interferes with my everyday life, my work, my relationships, it holds me back so much. I get irritable, overly stressed, worry about every little tiny problem, and on the physical side I get shaky, I stutter, my throat gets tight, my face turns red and hot, heart rate increases, and if it's really bad I cry and can't speak.nnAnyone who's talked to their doctor about this, can you give me some advice or share your experience? I guess I'm just worried the doctor won't believe me? It seems like everyone has anxiety these days, it's almost like a trend to say you have anxiety and depression so I don't want mine to be written off. I rarely go to the doctor to begin with so I'm not sure how to start this conversation. I don't want it to sound like I'm desperate begging for meds or something, I just need some relief. Another reason I've avoided this is because I'm a little hesitant to go on meds, I know they can mess with a lot of people and I don't want to become totally dependent...another thing to worry about lol (thanks anxiety).nnI also know therapy is super helpful too, but it's honestly something I can't afford right now, my insurance doesn't cover much. I want to get into therapy in the next year if possible but it's not an option at the moment. So I'd appreciate anyone's insight on this and how I can go about talking about anxiety with my doctor.

The only people I really trust are my parents and my boyfriend. I have a few friends that I sort of trust. I have been close friends with one of them for 8+ years. I don't have trouble with shallow communication with people. I don't enjoy small talk but I am pretty good at portraying myself the way I want to be seen. I am much more uncomfortable talking to people about myself or my life in general. nnI have been betrayed a lot of my life. I have always been a little bit of an outcast, but not so weird that I am unable to fit in. I don't know what my issue is. Over the last few years, I have made a few friends, but only 1 or 2 people that I would consider close friends. nnI don't want to be like this anymore. I have started to realize that this lack of trust and fear of betrayal has been negatively impacting my relationships with people. I come off as cold and aloof in my relationships, but that isn't me.nnI'm a little weird. I like to go to raves/festivals. I have done a lot of wild stuff in the time I have been on this planet, and I have done most of it alone. I like to be around other people, but I have a hard time genuinely connecting with anyone. I have always prided myself in being independent, but it has reached a point where I have started to realize that I am just afraid to let anyone get to know me. nnThe real question is what should I do about this? Am I choosing the wrong people to be friends with? I am insecure about any sort of relationship, but I am not insecure about who I am as a person. I don't really even know how to make friends. I have been hurt a lot in the past by so many people so I have just built up this tough outer shell. nnIt scares the hell out of me when people are interested in getting to know me. I always kind of think that they won't be interested once they actually see me for what I am. nnI guess the real question is does anyone have any advice? I have nobody to talk about this with and I can't afford a therapist. I feel really lost. nnI also probably should mention that I am a 21-year-old female college student. I am also an only child. nn"

I don't have any friends nor do I know how to make any.nI'm in Germany so I got psychotherapy and currently I'm for the fourth time in the psychiatry. The problem I have is this. I don't want to be who I am. But half of the psychologist or doctors are saying that I always stay this way and need to make peace with myself and try to do the best I am capable. The other half are saying this is only temporary and when (not if, they're saying when) I beat it, it is all gonna be worth it. I will thank myself for putting up the fight and winning.nBut then again I don't know that it will be worth it. I don't have any social contacts nor actual friends. Is it really that good? But why are they telling me (at least half of them) I should go with struggling. Would it not be easier to accept that I am a severe disabled person regarding socializing and never gonna be the person I want to be. Like a person without legs bc of a car crash is never gonna walk on his feet again should live the best he can. Why are there different opinions regarding anxiety? That really discourages me and makes me feel like a lab rat with no real therapy avaliable.nMy plan while staying here this time was to minimize social contact, so I would not dream about the other patients or especially about the girls in here. Because afterwards it makes me really sad. When it ends.nBut this psychologist here said I should try it and maybe even have a good time. And I'm in a dilemma. On the one hand I really want to do this, try this, but on the other hand the patients aren't talking to me anymore for giving them one week of my silent treatment. So then again I made everything harder for myself again.nnWhat are your experiences? Should I try to achieve this, which is super frustrating and cost so much energy or is it better to accept that I'm disabled and go on from there? "

I generally don't trust people but the times I do let my guard down, this is what seems to always happen; I get burned.nnI was kind of having this realization at work (it's a shitty minimum wage job that I'm over-qualified but I need something to do and some money is better than none) when my boss was really piling on the insults, negativity, bullying, and in-general being THAT boss. I've always took it on the chin and just tried my best to make her happy (I'm a people pleaser). I try to empathize and ask myself why is she such an insecure and toxic boss? Maybe because that's how she was treated when she was an underling or because a lot of the people there hate her. So I do literally everything she asks of me everytime she asks me to do something. Because I thought she was nice person deep down. But she kept being really disrespectful to the point that I had enough. nnI kind of realize, what the fuck am I doing? I'm letting myself get gaslit, insulted, and embarrassed for $8/hr. Unlike other managers she strips away any autonomy that you might have. So my anxiety is high and I'm just pacing around because I'm so mad and want to stand up for myself but not blow up and be dramatic. I want to just walk out and say fuck this shit. Fuck this bitch. But I'm also insecure at the same time so I can't do any of this, mostly due to her constantly negging the shit out of me all shift and the fact that I don't to be known as a quitter.nnSo I'm in the backroom not doing anything because I'm trying to cool off and want to walk tf out and she comes and starts belittling me again. And I suck it up and go out to help but she starts nitpicking at how I do my job AGAIN, just bullying me to make me feel bad. So i stand up for the first time ever to her and look her in the eyes and say no. Finally. And she immediately sends me home. nnI feel betrayed because I really did just do everything she asked of me and was especially nice towards her. I showed her multiple times that I respected her authority and that I was never undermining her. I always got the feeling she was just insecure which is why she was such a shit person. I was trying to go the show-the-bully-kindness route because she might've just been misunderstood or something but she turned out to still be mean, power-tripping, and toxic.nnI'm still asking myself how can someone be so fucking mean for no reason. nnNow it's going to be awkward if I ever have to work or see her again which is why I'm thinking about just quitting. I don't know. At least I drew a line.nnIf any of you guys read this, thanks for listening."

I experience only a rapid heartbeat and difficulty breathing in parties and after making small social mistakes. I can sometimes freely talk to people and have no problem. I certainly have moments when it's all too much, but it almost feels like a self-fulfilling prophecy, because I get stressed out from thinking about social anxiety before the social situation occurs (mostly when it already started and it's too late). Also I started seeing a therapist, but they don't really believe in giving a strict diagnosis and I think they might justifiably kinda look down at my internet-based self diagnosis. I'm not sure if even the therapist telling me I have social anxiety would help, because it just kinda feels sometimes like I'm forcing myself to lean into symptoms, so I can have something to explain my large amount of flaws and inability to connect."

Though it’s gotten a little better with medication and therapy, I keep on having this reoccurring fear that I’m never going to completely be confident or completely relaxed.

If anything, because of my anxiety, my high school experience was like what I imagine a monotonous 9-5 office job would feel like. I feel like it hits me a lot when I listen to songs about teenage hood or see my friends posts and conversations, I just feel like I’m too ugly or awkward or bland to have experienced what they have.nWhat I’m most scared about is not reaching those goals in uni and remaining the same boring person, or spiraling downward by chasing risks in hopes of “getting my teen years back.” nnIt’s scary to think about both, and I guess I just wanted to rant and see if anyone has felt or is feeling the same as to not feel so strange.

For me (and probably many others), social anxiety manifests in an inability to be authentic or genuine. I definitely try my best to be my most ""authentic self"" but anxiety just seems to act as a barrier between me and everyone around me. Either way, I have never felt a sense of ""community"" and have maybe once (?) had a friendship where I felt completely and authenticly myself. I'm currently in my second year in college and have not made any friends (even though I have surprisingly put myself out there a lot). nnI've been through pretty severe depression as a result of this and am still trying to cope. I've been through therapy, tried to meditate, etc. and haven't really gotten better. I've done some research on psychedelics and I think it might give some good insight on myself/others or a new perspective on life-- which I desperately need right now, as I can feel depressions claws reaching up to pull me down into the abyss.

I had everything planned out wake at 6:30 get ready take the bus at 7:17 that google maps told me to, it’s pretty accurate usually here. nnI woke up, took the bus now mid way I knew bus wasn’t right one and google had fucked up. I said I get out on the next stop and take the right if i can. Surprisingly I was pretty calm. At pint ticket controller get in a had the ticket so no worry. nnThe TC comes to me and before I show him the ticket, mf says “A document please” I said ok. Show him the doc. He start checking the detailed and after a few minutes says me sign here. Now I didn’t know what I was signing on so i said why, what am I signing? He says just sign and I say no tell me what am I signing. He gets super irritated and tells me “ok you don’t wanna sign it get out the bus” I ask him again Why? what am I signing ? nnBefore he says another word his colleague comes in and starts to calm him. Tells me it’s a fine because I do not have ticket and i told him I have the ticket your colleague didn’t bother to check it. He finally checks the ticket and says the its the wrong one. Now this is city bus (guest by colors and the company operating it) there’s only 1 ticket for it. And on the stop or the bus there weren’t any sign to buy different ticket. Btw I read the paper, saw they got some details wrong so they can’t verify me lol. I said ok and signed, in pressure and anxiety with bus full of people hearing our conversation. Four of them were around me. I never intend to pay that “fine”, if it’s official then it’ll get deleted after 5 years so it ain’t a big problem. nnIn all this I missed the doc appointment so I had to call them to cancel. Doc was skittle angry as I called just a few minutes before it. So I was angry/anxious AF and had to locate another bus to come back to my city.

My friend offered to pick me and take me out to dinner with her and her boyfriend. I've been dreading it all week.nnIt's the fact of meeting her new boyfriend. Driving together to the restaurant and then having to drop me back home that freaks me out. I have no escape plan. If I could have my boyfriend and it would be a double date I would be way more relaxed. But my boyfriend can't attend as he lives in another country. nnI'm so nervous tomorrow. I want to cancel so bad until I have my car next week but I don't want to make a bad impression. He is in residency so it's hard for him to get off. nnAnyways sorry for the ramble, I guess I'm looking for advice on how to handle this. Or reassurance? nIt's just driving me mad. "

If you still like each other 2 months later--BOOM--you're in love.nnFor the last decade, I've been too depressed and had too much anxiety to ever ask out the people I was interested in. I recently started therapy and SSRIs for the first time and, a few months ago I finally took the courage to ask out this girl I was interested. She's beautiful, smart, funny, and artistic. My type in so many different ways. I met her at work, and spent several months pining over her before I finally asked her out.nnWe got a long really well. I felt comfortable with her, and we had a lot of good conversations. However, things never really progressed, emotionally or physically. After a month and a half, I realized we would be better friends than lovers, and told her as much.nnI have a lot of issues, mentally speaking. But I feel like dating this girl (who's a really great person) has been an incredible learning experience for me. I feel less afraid of people, less afraid of asking them out, and less afraid of getting to know people. I feel like I might have made a friend. I also have a much better idea of what I want romantically, and feel more excited to meet someone who's right for me."

Small changes to my routine or surroundings would have me on the verge of tears.I was depressed as a result of my anxiety, and it held me back from so much as a kid.nnA combination of the right medication, working on my self confidence, and cannabis has changed my life in the best way possible. My senior year of high school, I joined the drama department and performed in front of hundreds of people. I can make direct eye contact without wanting to crawl out of my skin. I can ask a question in a full lecture hall without stuttering (I still blush quite a bit) and I've even gotten pretty good at public speaking. nnSometimes I struggle, but I'm very proud of where I am now compared to how I was.

In my country people enter medical school right away without the pre-med years bc we're taught almost everything we need in highschool biology. My social anxiety has started to cripple me ever since I started university. I was afraid of doing presentations, afraid of meeting new people, afraid to sit next to people during lectures bc they would notice my nervous fidgeting. I've had panic attacks during exams which significantly lowers my grades. And now I'm afraid I'll never overcome these obstacles and never actually be able to talk to patients. My parents really wanted me to become a doctor and convinced me this would be the only career choice that would give me a stable future. I think I'd be so much happier if I could work as a translator or something related to languages. But in my country there aren't many career oportunities in that area, according to my parents. I really feel inadequate here, detached from all the brilliant social butterflies that ace the exams and somehow have time to pursue classical music, theater, sports and all kinds of hobbies. Meanwhile I'm struggling with my anxiety, overwhelmed by people, thinking that maybe I should be the patient instead of the doctor."

I started first year and had a good GPA at that time, I believe it's 3.57. I entered ROTU (Reserve Officer Training Unit) in hope that I could build my discipline and leadership skill. But the reason were mostly just to make my father proud. I then entered the student council due to the recommendation of my officers in ROTU. But things only went downhill after that. I can't manage my time properly and I failed my classes. It was at my 3rd year studying that my GPA hit 2.2. It was at this time that I was diagnosed as clinically depressed when I went to a clinic psychiatrist at a government hospital. I went to the hospital only when I already attend a series of meetings with the university's counseling center, talking about my problems with my academic adviser, and my parents. I was even close to killing myself at the time. After discussing this problem with my dean, I then got a one year break from studying.nn​nnIt is now again my third year, repeating subjects that I failed while my old friends are close to graduating. I was no longer depressed but the backlash from the event have made me become socially anxious. I was close to fail the first semester but I managed to enter the second semester. I couldn't make any new friends in class. When there's a group work, I couldn't even communicate to find group members which lead me not doing the assignment at all. And then I started not going to class since I don't have any allies in class, couldn't even talk with them still. It's like they all have their own little circle and refuse to let someone new in. Lab work is in group but sometimes my group mates treated me like air, since I didn't follow their trends and can't jump in their little talks about their friends. Plus, they are girls. Unfinished assignments have been piled up, I didn't even attend to tests because I'm afraid of meeting my classmates. Overthinking stuff has been hell for me. I have a lot of fears now and I can't even believe in myself anymore. I wanna get out of this downward spiral but I can't seem to. What do I do?"

The things I've noticed is that I'm anxious around girls, am a bit anxious about how people think of me, in some cases it gets real bad. Also I turn red immediately if the teacher asks me to read something, and I just can't get out of my words, even if I'm reading the text already.

(we have 1 class with exactly the same people for every lesson and our class needs to move to a different classroom for every lesson) And I'm not sure if it's the anxiety that kicks in that I need to have a girlfriend, or that I just like her, as I've never had a girlfriend and don't know how it feels to have a crush on someone. The thing I feel is like thanos double fucking falcon punched me in the stomach, and I get even more anxious around her than other girls. I think I don't look too bad and know I can get a prettier girlfriend, as our standards for our class is pretty low, and she is the prettiest in my class, but our personalities are totally different, because she likes to party, but is shy (which makes her more attractive), while I really hate parties, and talk bad about myself, while not being shy.nJust looking for some help.nnIt's probably too long to read, sorry for any spelling errors, because English isn't my first language, and if I posted it on the wrong subreddit, just let me know and I will delete it and post it elsewhere.nI am not depressed, so don't think I'm in a worse state than some of you guys (or girls), your state  probably worse than mine and I'm not professionally diagnosed, just hang in there and do what you can "

I couldn't walk myself to school, my Dad have to walk me there. Even though we live VERY close to the school. I remember I have to bring my mom to my friend's bday party. In the 6th grade, we have a dance and my mom wants to chaperone it.

Came of Fluoxetine and stopped CBT at 19. Now 21.nnI have been in a really good place with my anxiety in the past 2 years or so. I allow myself to feel nervous in situations where it would be normal - exams, interviews etc but on the whole I’ve been really good (no panic attacks in almost a year and a half!). However, in December, I started learning how to drive and something about it makes me have those awful feelings of dread. I feel sick from the moment I wake up, I make silly mistakes in my lesson because I don’t have a clear head and I cry after almost every lesson. Even having good lessons doesn’t help. The reason I posted here and not somewhere else is because I think it is possibly some remnants of my SAD cropping back up. I am fine driving in the car with my dad - I drive to work, run errands, take the dog in the car with no problems, but the moment I have my instructor in the car, I panic because I know he’s judging everything I do. nnIt’s not an issue with the instructor, he’s lovely and I picked him specifically because he has a good reputation with nervous drivers but I cannot calm down. I start to spiral when I’m driving, lose concentration, make a mistake and start spiralling again. nnDoes anyone have any advice on how to stop this? I don’t want to go to the doctor because this is the only aspect of my life my anxiety still affects and I don’t have money for a therapist."

A little about me, 24 year old guy that feels like I grew up under the arms of family that loves me very much. I feel like I have had experiences that I tend to downplay at times but also I think these experiences are somehow subconsciously affecting me very much such as difficulties in trusting, fear of negative judgement, strong fears of what people that I think highly of think of me, a lot of fears. I feel selfish sometimes for my feelings if that makes sense at all.  I feel like I am a burden even though while I say this I simultaneously “know” that is not true. At least I think so? I feel so back and forth with my moods, I don’t wanna day I’m bi polar because I have not been professionally diagnosed but I have had extreme episodes of angry/frustrated “outbursts” within my relationships.

I've always been somewhat sexually repressed ever since I was a child. I wasn't really interested in getting a girlfriend (or boyfriend for that matter) like my peers, but I always told myself I'd become interested in it later. Fast forward to high school when I started having my first serious ""crushes"" (i.e., infatuations, borderline obsessions), but they were few and far between (nobody ever reciprocated), and I never really got into the whole dating scene. Nobody really hit me up like that, and the few people that did (very few I might add), I was not attracted to. I don't think I'm ugly or anything, but I guess I'm just ok looking. Although I have secretly dabbled in a few dating sites and sexted a few times (plz don't judge me lol), I have never been on a date, never kissed anybody, never as much of held hands with somebody romantically, and definitely never had any sexual contact. It's not like I'm asexual, demiromantic, or anything like that, although I'm a bit of a late bloomer on the whole sexuality thing. I wanna get laid like everybody else my age, which I know would probably be pretty easy to obtain because of dating sites, but I feel like it'll feel empty and shallow for my first dates, kisses, sex, etc., to basically be from a casual hook-up. At the same time, I really don't know how to reach any of these milestones like a normal person in real life because I've never experienced even the basics. I just wanna know if there's anybody who was this socially inexperienced at some point who can give me some pointers about what I should do in this whole situation. People usually say, ""just put yourself out there"" or that I need to ""flirt and let people know I'm interested"" but I don't really know how to do that. Flirting is a rare occurrence for me, and I've only attempted within the past few years. So yeah. Plz help! Ya boy is pathetic :PnnP.S - I'm going to Northwestern University in Evanston (near Chicago, Illinois) if that gives people some necessary context for advice."

I’ve never been officially diagnosed but I know for sure what it is and I’ve never reached out for help.nnRecently however it’s gotten so bad I can’t do anything but to lay in bed and think about the same thing over and over.. I can’t even get to work.nnThe thing that’s bothering me so much is a social even I attended last weekend. It was a small group of me and about 6 other people. n We took a roadtrip down to my best friend’s girlfriend’s summer house and brought a lot of alcohol.  nIt was fine the whole evening, although quite disappointing because two of the people we invited (a couple) were so incredibly boring to be around, and everyone was a couple except me, a girl Ive never met before and my best friend’s girlfriend’s sister. I socialized with everyone pretty much (I don have problems socializing at all, im actually pretty extroverted most of the time) but the only people that were really talking to me were my best friend and my best friend’s girlfriends sister (let’s call her M).nnIt got late and everyone was pretty drunk, although my best friend was probably the most intoxicated. We were heading inside to play some old quiz game on the PS2. We were all in the living room where there was a big corner sofa and an unmade bed. I was laying in the bed that was right next to the sofa and M was next to me but sitting in the sofa (sofa and bed was really close to each other) and me and her were talking, just waiting for the others to set up the game. I didnt think too much of it but she was getting closer with half her body on the sofa and the other half in my bed. It didn’t look weird though, it wasn’t close to being inappropriate IMO.nn That’s when my best friend says something in the lines of ”Stop hitting on my GF sister it’s f***n disgusting”, couldnt tell if he said it jokingly but regardless he said it in front of everyone. From my perspective I hadn’t hit on her at all that night nor did I have thoughts about doing it even though she’s really attractive. I was just enjoying that somebody was talking to me without me having to put 100% of the effort.nAnd being me, caring so much about what people think of me, turn super embarassed immediately. I go mute until I eventually tell everyone I’m going to bed. nnI go upstairs and just fiddle with my phone, with thoughts racing in my mind constantly. nEventually M comes upstairs and asks why I’m on my phone when I told everyone I’m gonna sleep. Although I was hesitating I told her my reaction to what my best friend said in front of everybody, how I care a lot about what people think of me and how it made me feel like everyone had this picture of me, that I was hitting on her and I didnt wanna be seen as that guy.nnShe tells me it’s not like that but she thinks I’m attractive and has wanted to kiss me and stuff, and has told her sister and a friend she has a thing for me. Obviously I’d never do that since it’s my best friend’s girlfriend’s sister. It’s wrong in my opinion and I wouldn’t purposely hit on her.nAfter our little talk my best friend comes up and we go outside to about everything in private. He apologized about what he said, he said he was joking but I don’t know, he also said that Im overthinking and nobody really cares.nnWe eventually go inside to everybody and it’s just a super weird. Nobody’s talking and everybody knows why I left. nWhat’s worse is that we still had another day to stay there, but the next day wasn’t that bad apart from the hangover. nnOn our way back we actually had a pretty good time, probably the highlight of this trip. But it was my best friend driving and M in the back. We took a different car and didn’t drive back with the boring couple. I’m glad I’m on good terms with M atleast.nnNow after this whole incident my anxiety has gotten really bad. And it’s really only because I think my best friend’s girlfriend really doesn’t like me no more. We meet occasionally and I feel it will be weird, because she probably knows every single detail that I’ve said and all. And I have a feeling she feels she shouldnt have invited me there after I made things weird. It’s super embarassing and it makes me feel so insecure if I’ll meet her again. nnAm I overthinking again or is this a real f*ck up that I’ll have to live with? And how do I deal with it?

I went into it thinking I’m gonna try this out for 7 days, no more then 10 minutes a piece and see where it goes. I’m not about 3 weeks in, I’ve missed a few days here and there but boy oh boy! I feel like a new man. Let me start by saying  I went into it with an open mind, wanting to enjoy it, and to find something that works for me in terms of guided mediation or just music. nnI choose guided at first til I soaked up some of the simple lessons, and the positive words you should tell yourself. And I spend 10 minutes everyday in bliss, I actually enjoy it, i allow the music to take me to a place of pure relaxation it’s like a holiday away from my day. And in that holiday I tell myself it’s ok! I look on life positively in that 10 minutes. I calm my incessant thoughts in that 10 mins, that 10 minutes has become a beach for my mind to relax in and not feel anxious. nnAnd the amazing thing is, during the rest of the day, when I get into social situations that were once filled with anxiety. For some reason, my mind is way more relaxed then it was. I don’t stutter anymore, I don’t heat up and sweat, and my mind doesn’t focus on every possible negative outcome that may happen in that social interaction. It’s an amazing feeling, and I have no doubt it’s going to improve.nnJust try 10 minutes a day for a few days pal see how it goes. Might no work for everyone"

(saying yes before thinking seems to be quite a good method, at least to some extent...). Yesterday me and 3 of my high school friends went clubbing. I didn't know how it would go but I wanted to try and not think much about it. Before we got there I was fine. After we got there I was fine. But I don't know. I immediately started feeling like it's not for me. Exhaustingly loud music. People everywhere. I can't dance, didn't want to, couldn't get myself to try, I couldn't imagine it being fun. Even while being drunk I couldn't do it. Ended up sitting for the whole time. Alone, sourrounded by everyone having fun. I don't remember ever feeling as alone as there. It was some of the worst hours recently. We finally decided to move on. There are pubs everywhere on the street. As we go by one of them there's 2 employees standing next to the entrance. One of them says to us ""wanna get in for a beer"" and the second one goes ""don't you see his friend isn't even 17"" like wtf. Do I need to be constantly reminded that I look like an ugly kid? When I got back home I jumped into my bed, hugged a fucking curled up blanket and cried myself to sleep harder than anytime recently. Nothing makes me happy. I don't know what to do. The more I try the worse it is. Nothing good ever happens. I still can barely make a hair appointment. I'm failing uni. I can't even begin to look for a job even though I have more than enough qualifications to find a good one. Everything scares me. I just dream about a true, peaceful, close friendship. One in which we could be honest about our thoughts and feelings. I want to have someone I can hug. It's all I really want. But I can't imagine opening up more to a man. I've never had a female friend. Never been close to having one. A year ago I was so down I actually tried to talk to one I've known like 9 years ago. She was the closest to me. We never even talked before. And she was the closest. That's how pathetic I am. I don't know. Am I fated to be sad? Maybe I don't know how it's like not to be? Maybe I want to be sad?

Last session we played Jenga as we talked (a board game) because she noticed I was nervous in my first session (and mentioned how I thought I might have social anxiety and wanted to work on that) so the board game would help with the anxiety.nnIt did help me not get anxious about sitting there with her but I was still too anxious to talk and say anything. nShe would ask me questions but my answers were always super short or a nod or head shaking. When I tried to talk my voice would break and it would be hard… she asked me if I had anything I wanted to talk about today and I shook my head. (Even though that had been the worst week of my life I couldn’t get myself to talk) nnso she just told me a story and we just talked about random stuff because I wouldn’t freaking speak. She said that therapy is the perfect place to practice and basically told me I need to talk (in a softer way) but I couldn’t! I have my next one tomorrow and im scared the same will happen. She probably thinks im so weird and dumb and think im not even trying…. But I just can’t. 😭 when I talk about my feelings I cry and if I start to cry I embarrass myself then I can’t continue talking.

6142,"Tacobela","post","My boyfriend is a socially awkward mess","My bf (23/m) and I (22/f) have been together nearly 3 years. We love each other very much and we’re both very socially awkward but the difference is that I’m much more affluent with my words and can communicate well when I need to, whereas my bf stumbles over his words, rambles on about pointless details, and sometimes he’ll just stop in the middle of a sentence bc he’s unsure of how to carry on. It’s a little embarrassing tbh. He does fine when speaking to me (aside from the occasional mess up) but with anyone else it almost sounds like he’s having a stroke. He’s an EMT which obviously requires dealing with people pretty regularly and he claims that he has no problem talking to them, and I believe him bc he does really well at work and has advanced faster than a lot of his coworkers. nWe’ve made plans to get married next year and we’re in the process of buying a house together. We had a meeting with a lender today and he stuttered for 5 minutes straight before giving up and telling me I’d have to take over from there. I have no problem with that but sometimes I just want him to be an important part of these types of things and not just sit there listening in bc he’s unable to communicate properly. I am very honest with him and try to give advice on how to effectively get his point across. There has been some progress in the last 3 years but it is very slow. I’ve suggested that he look into speech therapy but he doesn’t think it’s bad enough for that to be necessary. I know that he was accidentally placed in special ed as a child bc of his speech issues but was moved back to normal classes after they realized he was of average intelligence, so personally I do think that it is at a point where speech therapy is an option.nI love him and can’t see myself going through life without him. He’s the first person in my life that I’ve been able to trust 100% and we seem to be very compatible, I just have a difficult being crazy attracted to him when he can’t speak like a normal adult. I think that speech therapy would really do some good, not only in his life but in our relationship as well. Any thoughts?"

Part of what drove me out of college before was severe social anxiety, and a phobia of oral presentations especially.nnIn this class I’m taking participation is 25% of the grade, in another class it’s 20%. I have been trying so hard to chip away at my anxiety. In one of the classes I raise my hand and say something at least once a class, and got a review from my professor still saying I need to participate more, which broke my heart because it was already an uphill win getting my hand up once a class.nnIn the other class, it’s much, much worse. I think because it’s a smaller class, and the material is more abstract, so it’s easier to look stupid. I’ve spoken up a few times to varying success. One time I forced myself to say an idea and the whole time I spoke my voice was shaking so hard and it was so embarrassing. I keep telling myself that as long as I force myself to speak up, I’ll get better, but it’s been eight weeks now and that hasn’t happened at all. In fact I think it’s getting worse. nnI don’t know what else to do. I read the material thoroughly so that I’m not caught off guard. I have a plan that when my anxiety begins to flare up, to breath, meditate a little and bring myself back into my body. But anytime I think the teacher might call on me, or anytime my brain presents an idea that would be good to share with the class, my heart starts beating into my head, I get hot and sweaty, I feel like I can’t move, I feel so scared like I want to cry and run away. Every. Single. Time. It doesn’t go away. The breathing doesn’t help, the forcing myself to participate hasn’t chipped away at it whatsoever. It’s honestly maddening. I just want to participate like everyone else. nnI’ve also been working out regularly and eating super healthy, sleeping, no coffee, etc.nnI really need help with this. I’m waiting to get insurance (which is also taking a maddeningly long time to get, by the time I’m in a therapist’s office the semester will be over).

6191,"rocky8624","post","How social anxiety ruined my life","Hi there reddit, since i am not a native English speaker i'll be using Google Translaitor. I am not seeking for help or life advice i just want to talk.nnI am 20 and half years old and only now i realised how completely i ruined my life because of the anxiety. And there is no way out for me.nnAs far as I remember myself, I was always a rather shy and closed child, I did not go out outside unnecessarily. My first friends (and the only ones) appeared in my 5th grade. I well remember how we met, it was some kind of event and a couple of guys from my class came up to me and we just started chatting about everything - games, films, football, we chatted for at least two hours and then headed home and exchanged each other with console games. And in my opinion, it was a lot easier to communicate with strangers then. Secondary school, and then in my opinion the first problems appeared. When the homework was a pubic presentation or recitation of a verse by heart, I never completed these homewroks, as a result of which I got F grade and I had to hope only that in future we would no longer have such tasks, I was also afraid to go to the teacher and give me an individual task. In high school, the situation did not change, I was still afraid of public speaking and did not leave home unnecessarily, and when friends called for a walk, I always said that I was busy. A quick fact, in all my life I have never been to a cafe, to the cinema i wasnt even in a store alone. If I needed something, I asked my parents or sister to buy me. nnIn 2016, I passed the exams and entered the pedagogical university at the Faculty of Philology, this was one of the biggest mistakes in my life. Due to the fact that I did not really care about where to go, I had to quickly choose the direction. I had to move from countryside to city (not to far tho, about 130 kms) and learn to live on my own, buy groceries, pay utility bills and most importantly communicate with people, from that moment I no longer saw my friends live, both moved to other cities. Speaking of classes at the university, each English class needed to stand in front of the audience and tell the learned text, there were also quite often group work, and if I could barely cope with the first example, then when we worked in groups I was ready to disappear, run away , do anything if only I were not here, cause i simply cant talk to people which i dont know, My palms and forehead began to sweat.  No kidding, when I reached the bus stop and went to the university, for me it was a real challenge. What makes me even more anxious is that there were 22 girls and 6 boys in the group keying me. I went through anxiety for two months until one day I decided not to go to university, and from that moment on, my life went awry. I began to skip classes more and more, sleep problems started, I went to bed at 8 in the morning, and got up at 7 in the evening and my parents didnt even know about this situation. With bad points, but I still went through the first semester. But in the second situation did not change, I was not at the university for exactly a month and none of my classmates, headmen or curator were interested in what happened to me.  By the way, in January 2017, I stopped talking with one of my friends, the communication just broke due to some little trifle I don’t even want to mention it. April 2017, the curator told his parents that I did not attend classes, but I in turn made promises that I would attend classes. One day, after a long absence in class, the curator called me to his place and began to ask me what was happening to me, I had good points for the first months of my studies, and then everything went awry. After the conversation, she advised me to turn to a psychologist, but I immediately rejected this idea, although now, I understand that it might be worth giving this idea a chance. Even the girls from the group offered me their help, but I refused, i decided that it will be extremley hard to comeback.I just don’t have the courage to approach the teacher and ask for additional classes. As a result i was expelled from university. While I was in the city alone, I talked a lot about what to do next. They set me up as an example for my sister, laid more hopes on me, but I just didn’t live up to these hopes, I myself was not in awe of myself, I considered myself miserable and that there was no place for me like this in this world, so I decided that the best option there will be suicide. I decided to hang myself in the closet and when I felt cramps and lack of oxygen, a stupid thought crept into my head and said to me “Do not do this, give yourself a chance”. Now, I really regret that I succumbed to that thought and did not finish what it would be worthnnIn September 2017, I entered college and again, in November 2017, I was expelled. Classical history, anxiety, unwillingness to leave the dorm room due to loneliness, although I understand that I had to go to college and university not for communication, but for education. For almost 2 years now I have been living with my parents in the village, I leave the house only to throw snow from the yard, I haven’t been talking with my last friend since January 2019. My younger sister graduated from college, works and receives money, while I just sit on the neck of the parents. Guess, i messed up my life, opportunities, goal and there is nothing i can do about it. I dont watch movies, series, anime, sometimes playing games but right now nothing interests me, i just lay down on the bed and thinking about my pasy and what i have done. Last year I tried to start all over again at the university but I didn’t have 3 points to enter. nnIf you read up to this point, thank you for surviving this confused story with tons of grammatical errors, I appreciate it."

Because of this she'll often take breaks, we live in the same town but we only text, I could text her endlessly. nnOne of my personal mile stones with her is that she swore to never call anyone, and she means it. but in the recent monthd I've managed to convince her to let me call her with promise that she is not obligated to talk and that she can text back as I talk. These sessions take place at night and from 11pm-3am. nnA lil background to me is that I study people and society in college and my end goal is to be a therapist as an LCSW.

It’s so embarrassing going there and waiting surrounded of people and looking at the floor for like 45 min… makes me so nervous or walking in at the wrong moments….nnnSo I told her if she could call me over instead but now I’m so scared because she could call me any school day at any time during any class. Everything the phone rings I’ll get so anxious. And I’ll be anxious the whole day. (This happened once… everything the ohone rang for a week I got so anxious and she called me until like a week and a half later so I was stressed for so long) but I’m so scared of walking over there at wrong times or when she’s busy again."

I'm always worried that they secretly really don't like me and need some reassurance about it but even if they tell me I just go straight back to being nervous about it. nnIt just seems like throughout the day I have this knot of dread in my stomach, I'm rarely able to just be present because I'm constantly worrying, sometimes about nothing in particular I just feel like something's *wrong.* nnI'll sometimes feel physical symptoms, stuff like feeling sick and nauseous, racing pulse and sweaty hands and I won't be able to talk very well. usually it's before I have to talk to people I admire or any group. nnI'm pretty insecure and I think that plays into the need for reassurance, I just feel like I'm not good enough or good as others, and that I'm being excluded socially because of that. I fear that I'm being too clingy often but also don't know how to be more included. nnThere's more to it but that's just what I can think of that I've been struggling with for awhile now. nnDo these signs point to anxiety or could this just be stuff that people have to deal with? I don't know whether to try to see a therapist or doctor about it because I don't want to blow it out of proportion. I just wanted to ask somewhere"

I live with severe social anxiety and it fucking sucks. I have no friends whatsoever, not even internet friends because I'm too fucking scared of talking to people. I'm so embarrassed of this and the fact that my parents worry about my lack of friends is adding fuel to my shame. I'm 20 years old and I haven't ever had real friends besides my parents and my sister. I'm not joking, the last time I ever considered someone a friend was when I was 13. Since then, I have been alone, not even acquaintances. This usually doesn't bother me that much; I'm used to being alone and my introvert self delights in this but it makes me feel ashamed when others point it out. I feel so inadequate, so inferior.nnI feel like a waste. I hate the fact that my parents talk about me behind their backs and try to be all delicate with me when talking about things I need to do if I want to have a ""proper life"". Like, you need to go out more, you need to have a relationship, you need to talk to people. It's always that; you need friends, what if we can't always be there for you? you must be lonely. Well, I'm not lonely but embarrassed that people assume I am. It's so shitty when I can't do things normal people do because of my social anxiety. I have cried because of phone calls. I have cried because I madly want to get therapy but the idea of talking about these things with another person and being judged/analysed by them is so terrifying to me. I'm nervous of having to talk to a therapist, like. I wish things were easier."

Sorry if the post is messy, I have a lot to wright and I don't want to take ages talking about this.nnI'm 16 M and I've been struggling with overwhelming anxiety and depression for the past 10 months. It just hurts to live anymore. I repeat the same day over and over and over. I get up go to school, get out of school, and then spend the rest of my day in bed.nnMe and my family moved countries a few months ago, and ever since I have been broken. I left behind everything I had known my entire life, alongside all of my close friends that helped me with my anxiety beforehand. I'm in the last year of high school in my new area, and I have no friends, or acquaintances. I know no one. I spend all of my time by myself or with my younger sister in school.nnI get really bad anxiety when doing any simple task anymore. Talking to a single person makes my heart beat fast, sweaty hands and I mess up saying my words. I have a really severe stuttering problem, any word I say I stutter for 3 seconds trying to spit it out. So this makes my anxiety even worse. I've just resorted to not saying a single word to any of my peers during class in fear of being mocked or laughed at.nnMy sleep and thought patterns have been awful too. I try to stay up as long as possible to avoid going to school, and in my free time outside of school, I'm either in bed on my laptop, or I'm trying to play games with my old friends. My thoughts have been really dark recently. I'm always thinking about suicide and I keep having existential crisis that last hours on end. I've also been doing a bit of self harm when I'm alone, I'm trying to stop doing it but it sometimes overwhelms me and I can't help it.nnI have talked to my mum about my issues but she really only cares about my education and always sends me to school when I get regular panic attacks. I really just want to give up and not have to spend my entire life working and going to school. I just think there is mo point to that. My mum has been caring though, I first told her about my issues a month ago when I broke down after holding all my emotions to myself. She has booked an appointment with a therapist, but I don't know if I even want the help, I just want it to end.nnI'm really just posting this to get some kind of peace in my mind.

I am such a jealous person that all it takes is for someone to talk to my crush that I feel like my insides are being burned and I need to throw myself off a building just to make the pain stop. I hate this. It is so childish but it's not good at all. There was this girl in an abusive relationship that I remember convincing myself that I could be lucky with. And the funny thing is, I know that she found me attractive, I'm not even going to mention why, and her boyfriend also could not stand seeing her with me that he'd spend the time looking over, stress and constantly coming over. Co-workers told me this. Had no idea why he was being a c*nt to me even. But the truth is a normal guy would definitely have done something and get her to like him, she was that broken and it'd be the right thing for her to do, but me, she'd never leave such a relationship for me. It sucks. Maybe it's better for her. Maybe somebody that likes me for who I am is enough but maybe I'm not a good person and any girl would make a mistake to be with me.  God there are things I should mention but I'm not going to, because I think this story is enough for you to tell me I should see a therapist and not seek relationships.

It's something that affects my every day life and I fear it's making me bordeline agoraphic. My mum's a psychologist and she agrees with me that I (probably) have SAD. She actually told me about it before me knowing it had a name.  Now, because of ethics and her being my mum and all, she can't actually diagnose me with anything.

They are kind to me, so I don't understand why I keep feeling this way. Since I've known them, my friends haven't treated me badly at all; it's very rare they even treat me neutrally.

6392,"AA9920","post","The Key to Overcoming Social Anxiety","If you suffer from social anxiety, there's a good chance you have low self esteem; feel stupid, ugly, helpless and completely fragile. You probably feel like going out more will help to fix this or making new friends, etc, but the truth is none of this will solve the core of your anxiety issues. Even if you do start going out, make new friends and become more social, etc, yeah, you will feel a temporary moment of happiness, but then your anxiety will come back with a new theme, such as ""Oh yeah, you have friends, but they probably hate you"", and there goes another spiral of anxiety and it's a never ending nightmare. To solve the core of your social anxiety, you must embrace all your self esteem issues and all your anxieties. What does this mean, you may ask? I know this sounds very counter-intuitive, but if you give up and just say ""fuck it, I'm a dumb, ugly, useless, fragile anxious mess and I love it soooo much"" and TRULY accept it and embrace it with all your heart and you don't bother trying to fight it or anything, eventually over time the anxiety loses all its power and you will see the world in a much clearer way which is that ACTUALLY there is nothing wrong with you as a person and that all those self esteem issues you once had were just an illusion created by your faulty malfunctioning amygdala warning you against threats that never existed in the first place. Also, paradoxically, the more you accept you may never have friends, the easier you will find it to actually make them, because you're not forcing it to happen and therefore don't come off as clingy and it all flows naturally like it should. Same way as sleeping; if you force yourself to sleep because you have an exam the next morning let's say, guess what? You become unable to sleep. But if you let yourself fall asleep whenever it comes and don't force, it comes naturally. Though, I recommend this be done with a social anxiety therapist who is trained to deal with these things.nn&amp;#x200B;nnOne thing to also note is that your anxieties I don't think will ever 100% go away, but 99% of it definitely. The thing is that you will always get incredibly mild triggers of anxiety likely from time to time but as long as you just leave it there and don't fight it, it will go away shortly, so that's nothing to worry about."

I guess there is none.nnAs I grew older I’d have less problems with social situations and today probably no one would notice I’m nervous all the time, since I’m a pretty social normal guy. But still, it’s eating me up inside.nnFor example; it always hits me worst BEFORE social events, and I’d be super nervous always even though it’s usually with people I know well. Or before work, I used to always be a little nervous, or just anything that puts me out of my comfort zone that’s my house. Even just meeting a good friend would make me nervous. nWhen I went on a date earlier this year I was so nervous I had to take a few shots to help.nnBut it isn’t always just the nervous feeling, sometimes conversations are a struggle because I literally just don’t know what to say sometimes. There are a few friends I have where I don’t have to think about what to say before hand and I love that feeling. And usually it comes down to I don’t want to say something weird or be judged. But that always ends up backfiring because you think through everything you say and end up not saying it. nThis has caused me to have issues building stronger friendships because it always ends after small talk.nnAnd the worst part of this is THERE IS NO CURE! I worked at a place where I had to be social every day with people I don’t know and everyone was the same age (~20), and to an extent it definitely helped my social skills but this nervous feeling ALWAYS comes back. nnSo what can I do about this?

I want to atleast reduce this thing to some extent. I have problems speaking up for myself, and although battling anxiety may not be completely possible without a therapist, I could make things a bit easier for me.nHere's what I intend to do:nn1. To find an accountibility partner and meet once / twice each week through zoom or Google meet, and start of by sharing our experiences on anxiety. Since we'll be strangers so this drill itself will help us with the stress we feel when we talk to others.nn2. After a couple of sessions, we'll set up targets as to how we might cope up with the various situations. Also this won't be limited only to anxiety issues. If anyone has any other targets which they aren't able to achieve, they might also try including it here. But main focus will be on improving our mental state and trying to shape our life.nn3. I want serious and dedicated people in here, as this thing inside my head is eating me alive now. I cannot pay for therapy yet, and it's also covid 19 going on. So only those who are motivated enough respond to this post.nn4. I'm planning to start with a single accountibility buddy, but we could even have a small group of 3-5 people helping each other.nn5. Every session we'll primarily discuss our progress, and plan for future action. If we are able to make progress we congratulate each other, if not we motivate one another.nnI'm trying to do this as soon as possible so, interested people pls DM or PM me. Also there's no restriction on age and gender, but I'd prefer guys around my age (give or take 2 yrs), but with that been said, it's only a preference. So whoever you are, don't hesitate to reach out. nAlso the main criteria to join is to have some sort of general or social anxiety.

When I was 16 (I’m 22 now) I was diagnosed with Thyroid Cancer. Due to invasive surgeries around my neck area one of my vocal colds are completely paralyzed. This happened when I was 18. Basically how they work is these two folds in your neck move in unison to create your high pitches and low pitches so my voice is much weaker due to one fold having to do all the work. This results in me having a deeper, breathy voice that’s almost impossible to discern in any sort of loud or social environment. Some days my voice is decent enough, sometimes due to inflammation it’s hard to talk in even quiet environments. Mind you I was relatively extroverted during my teen years prior to losing my voice. I was an icebreaker, passionate about the causes I cared about and just loved meeting and getting to know people. I know deep down inside this is the person I still am, but physically it’s not possible for me to be this person anymore. I’m not kidding when I say I feel as if I’m a shell of former myself. I hate the fact that I can’t speak up about anything anymore. It’s humiliating when people ask you to speak up but you physically can’t. That your sorry you can’t talk louder because your voice is quite literally broken. I’m sorry for ranting. I just want my voice back. Please don’t ever take your voice for. Your voice is one of the most important things on dictating who you are as a person and how you connect with other people. Cherish it, ask questions, learn from others, and use it for good. Because if somehow science allows me to one day get it back to what it use to be. I know I will in full force."

I’ve had bad anxiety since like seventh grade, and every since I got to high school it got worse. I always feel like I’m being watched or silently judged, and even though I know that’s not true there nothing to really convince my brain it isn’t. I overthink the way I walk and am worried I walk weird, the way I move, if I’m moving awkwardly, I’m tense all day and can’t relax and have even skipped class due to how much I didn’t want to go to one of my classes. It’s stupid and I know those are things I shouldn’t be anxious or even think about but that’s anxiety I guess. Within the past few months I’m pretty sure I’ve fallen into depression (isolation, no motivation to get out of bed/takes hours after I wake up to get out of bed, cutting/hitting/biting myself), and I might be getting to a doctor/therapist soon for help.nnnI am just wondering if itd  be smart to go to school completely online for the rest of the school year. My school has this schedule where we only go certain days of the week and sadly all my friends have the other schedule so I spend my lunch hour in the bathroom now, which is where I’m typing this from right now, so I really don’t see a point in going."

All the other kids in my neighborhood were either a couple years older or younger than me, so I was kinda singled out. To make matters worse, in fourth grade, I switched schools. By the time I got to the new school, friend groups had already been formed (it was a k-8 school). Eventually, I did make friends, or so I thought. I wouldn’t call them friends, more like “friends” who just forgot I exist on the weekends or even at school.nnFinally I made it to high school. This was supposed to be the time I could finally get some real friends, maybe a best friend. Well it didn’t work out like that, and I ended up just making fake friends that probably just talked to me cause they were sorry for me. I really tried. I have been to numerous therapists and gotten advice, but no matter what I do, nothing changes. I am now in college and I guess it’s improved, but my years of having no real friends drastically lowered my self confidence and made me extremely self conscious/anxious. nnI have been hurt so many times that at this point, when someone genuinely wants to be my friend, I am nervous. I’m nervous that they’ll be like all the other “friends.” I am very open about my feelings, and get attached really quickly to people. Sometimes I think I scare people away. nnThat, ladies and gentleman, is my question. Am I doing something wrong? If I am being myself and STILL not being noticed, what do I do. I have already tried the “just wait for the right people” approach for 20 years, but it hasn’t worked. What else can I do? I am involved on campus, and a genuinely nice guy, yet I feel like I’m a background character in everyone else’s lives. Thanks! Any advice would be appreciated :)"

I was being bullied on all stages of life because I'm a bit eccentric and not really a type of person who'd stand up for themselves. My biggest fear right now is that I will be bullied again at university and not only that, I'm terrified with the thought that I might be bullied in my own flat without anywhere to run.

Recently, I had an appointment with a psychiatrist to talk about a treatment plan. She suggested that I try cbt instead of psychoanalytical therapy and suggested me taking ssris to manage my physical symptoms and help stabilize my mood. The thing is, my mom is really against me taking antidepressants because she’s scared I’ll get addicted, and as I’m 17 it’s not really like I can make the choice myself. Even the psychiatrist tried to convince her and told her that she thought they would help me a lot and that she would be constantly monitoring my progress, but my mom is still not so open to the idea. I know that medication isn’t a cure-all and that there are negative side effects, but It’s just really frustrating knowing that I might be missing out on something that could potentially help me make progress after being anxious for so long because of my mom’s stubbornness. I understand her worry, I honestly really do, but I’m just so tired of knowing why I’m anxious and the root of my worrying without being able to much to combat my symptoms (not dissing my current therapist btw, she has helped a lot too lol). The compromise my psychiatrist and my mom worked out is that I’ll go to a trial CBT session next week and do a blood test to check that my anxiety isn’t linked to any thyroid issues. I’m definitely willing to give cbt a try first, but I still would like to have the option to try antidepressants in the future if my mood isn’t budging. But I don’t know how to convince my mom who has her mind pretty much set already and hasn’t become much more open to the possibility. Any advice?"

I couldn't mute myself or turn the camera off, so I just turned my laptop away.

My roommates made food and a cake and everything which was super sweet of them. I asked “is she not coming?” About my roommate instead of “are they not coming”. Only 5 seconds later I realized what I said and said to myself sorta, “they, sorry.” And idk if those roommates heard. nnAnyways since then they’ve been more cold than usual. I’m usually pretty quiet and keep to myself but we have decent small talk the few times i see em. They look in my direction during conversations and seem happy to see me. But especially today I was walking with them for a long time to an event and they completely disregarded my existence pretty much the whole time and talked about their inside jokes. I said multiple things to which they said yeah and nothing else and started talking among themselves. When I said I wanted to go to the event with them they seemed pretty unexcited and honestly kind of annoyed. nnIt was like an hour of feeling super left out and feeling like an incredibly shitty person for misgendering my roommate and now being perceived as a shitty person because of it. My non-binary roommate seems to be okay with me, because they probably don’t know what I said. I feel like I deserve it, but also disappointed because I’m not actually a rude person who doesn’t respect other genders; it was a mistake. Or maybe I’m just overthinking it and they just find my socially anxious personality boring.nnTo be fair i don’t care much if they love me or not, I have made a few friends in college. And I understand why they’d dislike me for it, they’re very close to that roommate. It just hurts to be seen as a bad person and being treated with disregard because of a mistake I made.

I'm not embarrassed to share anything about trauma or social anxiety but something about my pieces being about very current struggles made me just feel sick to my stomach as soon as I stepped into the class.nI cover up anxiety usually with jokes and weed but I obviously needed to be alert. As soon as I stood up I immediately I got shaky &amp; started crying. They encouraged me to continue since everyone was sharing very personal stories and someone was bound to cry. I just didn't think it would be me.nI cried to whole way through. I even put my glasses down so I couldn't see them anymore and continued as contained as I could but I still had tears running down my eyes and all over my mask.nI don't know these people really. The 3 in the class I kind of know are very surface level. Out of all of the embarrassing things I've done this one humiliated me. The way this program works means I see this same group of people for about 6-8 hours every week for the next like 2 years.

She also said my eczema is probably caused by mental problems too and that I should see a psychologist first. I've never been diagnosed by a doctor as to suffer from depression or social phobia, but I have been feeling depressed for a long time (more than 2 years) and already isolated long before the quarantine started. I have also been suffering from social anxiety(I self-diagnosed myself based on the stuff Ive been researching on the Internet for a year however Im not a specialist nor a doctor so as you might guess its not even accurate.)

So finally out of obligation I had to tell my brother what Ive been going through and he arranged this psychologist too.

And people like that are pathetic. nnI think people like us with social anxiety have had so many negative experiences that’s it’s just stuck to us like glue. And we sometimes think everyone dislikes us and we doubt everything. That’s why we hole ourselves in and don’t speak out. We feel like our words are not good enough when they are. nnWe need to think positive things. Like so what if randomo glared at me, talked behind my back because I didn’t talk to anybody or have a small convo with crazy lady Karen. Like sorry but my anxiety is bad. I come first. Not anybody else. nnAnd if people hate you for it then they do. Do not live for other people and what they think of you. Live for yourself. Just explain to the people around you if they ask why you’re so quiet. And when you give them the answer and they look down on you, or do not take you seriously. Then at the end of the day they’re not worthy for you to be around and converse with anyway. nnI’m sick of feeling like shit and that there’s something wrong with me. Technically there is with my anxiety, however is there something seriously wrong with me? No. Im like any other person and should be treated like any other. nnIt’s like being quiet is something so rude and bad to do when it’s not. I’m a lovely person, I say hi to people, I smile, however I’m just not talkative enough.

I posted on a OCD subreddit and quickly became acquainted with a redditor. Now i’ve never talked to strangers on the internet... and certainly not on reddit, but it was interesting. I had never felt happy having someone to confide in and talk to about everything and anything. Its been almost two months and i still cant get over our “friendship” if you could call it that. I feel happier and i dont like it cause i fear rejection and embarrassment. It hurts me to know I seek comfort in someone who i have no access too. Am I delusional (given my social anxiety)? Any tips on detaching yourself from someone? Any tips on how to stop LIKING someone?"

I’ve never been able to converse well with others, even my friends. I have no clue how everyone does it so well. Just today, 1 of my friends who usually keeps up conversation with the other was busy texting someone else, and my other friend said it was awkward because we weren’t talking, just walking in silence. But I just didn’t know what to say. I seriously have no idea how everyone else seems to do it so naturally. Usually, I just join in on conversations. I think silence is my natural state or something, but I wish I could learn how to converse well with others. It sucks seeing other people live so freely without having these types of problems."
6889,"Psychological-Dirt35","post","I have a presentation for a big conference in 3 days and i am scared af. I don't have anyone to talk to about it so please read the full post and give suggestions. I will be really grateful.","Please ignore the errors. This my first time posting anything on Reddit. Please bear with me. This may sound like a rant but I really need to get this off my chest. nnSo I (19F) have been diagnosed with severe depression and social anxiety. I am deaf (since I was 10 years old) because of which I have problems with pronunciation, sometimes I speak too fast and too loud without noticing which has led to some really embarrassing situations and I feel too scared to talk to people or to go to a new place alone. Along with this, I am overweight (since I was 11 years old) which adds to the situation. I have psoriasis (a skin disease since I was 14, it doesn't have a cure except a few medicines to lessen it) and I have hypothyroidism. Food is one of my coping mechanisms although I know it is unhealthy but I overeat when I am really stressed. This might not seem too relevant to the post but I am having self-esteem issues and physical appearance issues. I have always been made fun of. Many might not consider it severe bullying but it has taken a lot of toll on my mental health. My friends, my family, my relatives have all made fun of me. I despise having to act like it doesn't hurt me when I just want to say ""just shut the fuck up and mind your business"" to them. nnIn my country, we don't have a big concept of mental health and along with this, I am from a rural area so it's hard to actually talk to someone about it. I didn't know much about mental health until I went to a big city to one of the best colleges in the country for my UG degree. I was glad to meet many open-minded people who were strong advocates of mental health. I started a bit of counselling with a college counsellor for a while in my second semester but then the lockdown happened and I had to go back to my hometown. nnI was going through a really dark time last year and it was too much so I finally decided to talk to mom but as you can expect it didn't go well. She was like, ""do yoga, eat less, be less lazy"" It took a lot of my strength to open up to her. So I decided that I won't open up again to her. nnI have complicated relationships with my father,  my brother is a teenager and he has some frequent outbursts because I find it hard to talk to him. I can't even say hI without him saying fuck off to me. So they are not an option at all. I have some friends but I can't go to them because I feel like a burden. nnIn November 2020 my aunt passed away. She was like a second mom to me. I loved her to the bones. I was suicidal (planning the way I was going to do it) the day she passed away before receiving the news of her passing away. It was really devastating to hear it. I was not able to cry and had to force myself to shed tears so that people won't start back talking. I feel guilty because I loved her and was not able to cry. I miss her so much. She was kind of my rock. nnAfter she died, people forgot about her for 2 weeks. Everything went back to mostly normal except my cousins. So it made me realise that people won't remember me even if I die. So I don't need to worry about missing me. I shaved my head because the issues were becoming too much and I needed to do something. I had final exams the month after which took a toll on me. So I contacted the college counsellor (F) and she helped me a lot during my exam period. I am really thankful to her. nnShe suggested that I try in-person counselling here (near my hometown). I kind of convinced my mom to take me. My finally breaking down and shaving my hair in front of her did kind of helped her see the severity of the situation. So she asked my uncle to find a good therapist. He suggested the one his mom has been going to for years. nnP.S. In our area, we don't have many covid cases, not even now. And all the precautions were taken while visiting both the therapists. nnAt first, everything was okay but later the therapist (M)  suggested talking to him every day for 2 hours on an online messaging app. Some of the messages made me really uncomfortable. But as I don't know much about therapy and all, I was not sure what was right and not but did know it was not okay. I told him not to ask these questions anymore. I have had really traumatic experiences from my childhood which I would like to go into detail into but I did tell him about and he agreed to not ask or talk about those kinds of stuff. nnBut 2 week fast forward, he sent me a disturbing gif. To add to this, he is at least 40 yrs older than me. It was really disturbing and I had a breakdown. I told him it was not professional at all and also told him I needed to go somewhere and switched off my data but I switched it on he was acting like a harassing man like a reply to me, why are you not replying. nnI went to Google and did a bit of a search which made me believe I was not being oversensitive and what he did was not good. I contacted my college counsellor and showed her the chats and she confirmed that it was unethical. So I blocked him. Told my mom and uncle. I wanted to confront him about how he can do this. What he did made me scared to reach out for help again. However, we didn't go. I didn't get to confront him. Which made me resent my uncle kind of because he knew how much important it was to me. nnFast forward, I went to a new therapist (M)  recommended by my college counsellor however, my mom is with me inside, so I cannot freely talk. It hasn't been effective at all. I don't say much. He asks questions to my mom. I don't get to talk much. He doesn't give any advice. Just medicine. It's not that he is not a good therapist, just not suitable for me. I can't ask to change because I already have once. I have to pretend that I am doing better when I am not because I don't want to talk about it. nnSo about the situation. Because of lockdown,  I have limited in-person interactions which have worsened my social anxiety. I feel scared to talk in online classes. I had 2 panic attacks even when I needed to speak just for 2 mins (it was about talking in the department meeting about the problem I am facing because of the online mode of education as a deaf). This is how much my situation has worsened. I don't even turn on my mic for attendance. I write in a chatbox. I don't give presentations. I do double work ( research and making ppt) and a friend presents for both of us in a group presentation. My professors have given me this privilege for which I am really really thankful. nnI want to go to study abroad in one of the top universities for my higher studies(currently I am in my 2nd year). 2 research paper helps the application process although they are not compulsory. My cousin (My dad's brother's son) is a scientist. He is really successful and has earned 15 prizes. He is helping me with the procedure. nnWe both worked on 2 research papers and I needed to present them at a conference. The presentation for paper one was offline at first which is a benefit for me because I was more comfortable with it. I did the mental preparations required. However, a day before the conference I was informed that the conference will be now online on zoom after a few days. nnI am scared as fuck. I had a practice session before (1 month ago) with my brother and 2 friends online but I got a panic attack. I was sure since I am close to these people it won't be hard but shit happens. I tried talking to my brother about public speaking, social anxiety and his response was something like it is all made up just in the head. I did tell him it was not Self-diagnosed. So talking to him again is not an option. Furthermore, I don't want to disappoint him. My mom doesn't understand the severity of my social anxiety. nnI can't ask anyone for advice. Please don't suggest things like ""you can do it"", ""be positive"", ""you are strong"". I am sick of this. I need real advice about how not to fuck it up. It's on zoom which doesn't have any captions which add to stress as I will have no fucking idea about what they will be speaking. My brother said that he will send the conference a formal male to tell them to write the questions in the chatbox. nnI speak too fast and loud. My pronunciation sucks. How can I perform better? Please don't give a motivational-cum-be positive speech, I have plenty of them. If you have really advice suggestions then please do tell me. I will be really thankful. nnTL:DR - I have to present at a conference in 3 days. I am deaf because of which my pronunciation sucks. I get panic attacks while trying to speak in an online meet, class or session. I need suggestions on how to be more confident and prevent a panic attack just for the 10 mins I am presenting. I don't care if I get a heart attack or a  broken bone after those 10 mins."
6890,"Footloose27","post","My SA Journey so far","So I'm 21M and was recently diagnosed with social anxiety. Now my case is weird because I was born with a speech disorder and the symptoms of SA are almost identical to the anxiety a stutterer can face. But ever since I was a child my speech overall has really improved, the anxiety hasn't though. Having SA is one thing to deal with, but I also have to deal with a stutter on top??? So now in social situations I m faced with automatic response social anxiety symptoms along with the thoughts of ""well I better not stutter"". It's not the best combination to have and this combination has made me really fearful of ALL types of social interactions such as having a full time job, participating in class, going out to social outtings, family events, etc. I definitely have more of a SA problem then speech problem I would say. nnSo I decided to do things to help myself (in theory they are supposed to help). I went to CBT and only had the money for 5 sessions. Our sessions we're relaxed, understanding, and he helped me with identifying one fearful situation I could change to make myself feel more comfortable (wedding ceremony if that ever happens lol) but I got a long ways to go with CBT. It was mostly aimed at changing thoughts but I am way more concerned with the automatic anxious feelings I get that I feel I can't control. nnI've been taking Prozac for a while but I have no idea what it has done. I may have to experiment with social anxiety medications (if any have helped you I am all ears)nnI tried meditation which helps temporarily for myself. My mo had really bad anxiety in her thirties, she meditated for 10 years, and claims she has practically cured herself, which is amazing for her.nnIf you experience physical symptoms of anxiety to an overwhelming degree you should try propranolol it really helps me and I use it very little.nnI tried CBD oil and it made me 20% more relaxed. I take it before social things like family events or before I go into school or next in my life, work.nnI decided to lose 46 pounds and continue to lose. This is just a small self-steem building block to help with confidence in social situations. I try to run most days and eat healthy everyday. I read a book called Eat to Beat Depression and Anxiety by Drew Ramsey. I didn't use the recipes but he offers tons of information on optimal brain nutrients and vitamins you should aim for in your diet to help 'manage depression' which often is accompanied by anxiety. nnI figured speech may be the cause of my anxiety too (it definitely contributes but I don't stutter that much it could be WAY WAY worse). So I joined a speech program and worked at its methods really hard for 2 months straight. I really improved. Then I stopped doing the exercises and I am still benefitting from what they have taught me but I should be treating those speech exercises like working out - do it everyday.nnI can truly say the only thing that drastically improved my social anxiety was COVID-19. I no longer had to go into school with a pounding heart and hating each day, day after day of heart pounding, avoiding stuttering, and being engulfed in socially anxious thoughts. I sit at home, complete my homework, drink a little at night, hangout with a friend or 2, things I just generally enjoy (things that don't make me feel like a weird human being haha). So eventually within a year I will have to get a full time job. Terrifying haha. I am hoping that I will eventually get comfortable at work because most of my life until moving to a new college I was always SOMEWHAT comfortable at school. But since moving to the latest school I experienced chronic social anxiety as soon as I stepped foot on the campus. nnSo I don't know how many of you in this forum are 'recovered' or have found ways to help manage your social anxiety, but I am all ears. I would love to hear what path you took with social anxiety if you learned to manage it. Hopefully some of the information I put here is relatable or helpful.nnThank you for reading."

6916,"WesternNinja0","post","Is opening up about social anxiety to ""friends"" even possible?","Social anxiety of course makes it harder to open up about feelings, including those about social anxiety. I don't think I've ever said to anyone I knew that I experience (albeit self-diagnosed) social anxieties. People can probably tell, because I often express social worries, which ends up being alienating. I often get ""your over thinking it"" or ""don't worry."" And then people who say things like this often stop talking to me. I really want to say ""listen, I get anxious for no logical reason a lot, especially with social situations. I probably have social anxiety disorder and might need to go to therapy for it, but I have anxiety about the idea of therapy too."" But I feel like that would be more alienating. I want to just appear to be a cool, fun, confident person people want to hang out with, but these feelings eat me inside and sometimes slip out when I'm talking. I always have to hide my anxiety so people will like me. Because whenever I inevitably show signs of it people disappear from my life. But I don't want to be a liar my whole life either.  Is it even possible to open up about it without being alienated or people looking at you differently? Because at the the moment it feels impossible for me."

We barely touched on my depression. I thought we would go through a questionare or something but he barely asked questions and just expected me to talk I guess. Then he ended it off asking if I had any questions and I didn't so I said that i didn't and he was like 'I know you do'???

But I saw the irony in doing that for anxiety meds when I'm trying to get better so I decided to do it myself. I waited for about 10 minutes on hold, they answer the phone and I say hi and start to ask if I can check on a prescription-and she hangs up on me mid sentence! I thought maybe we just disconnected so I called back and was on hold for another few minutes and it happens again! If she couldn't hear me she could just say that???

I'm 20 now and about to graduate from college. I don't feel like I've grown at all. nnI have trichotillomania, which is the uncontrollable urge to pull out my own hair. I have huge bald spots and I've never felt confident about my appearance. I've never been in a relationship or even on a date.nnhad a big group of friends in middle and high school, but I always felt like the odd one out. I only ever felt really close to one of them, because on my first day of middle school, they kind of adopted me. Then her friends became my friends. But in the group of us all, I only really felt truly comfortable around her. If she wasn't at an event, or at lunch one day, I didn't really feel comfortable to hang around the others on my own. I ate by myself those days. I always felt bad because I felt like I was too clingy to her. nThen we graduated from high school and everyone went away to their different universities. Those who did stay have their own schedules and other friend groups, so I never really see them. Quarantine didn't help. I still talk to one friend from high school regularly, but she's incredibly busy. I don't have a license so I can't drive to see her. She has a license but doesn't drive.nI'm going to graduate from college in a few months. I'm studying film. But I don't feel like I did much. When we had simulated sets or group projects I got overwhelmed and would go retreat to what I call my ""designated crying stall"" in the bathroom or my bench. I would rush through lab hours just so I could go home. I don't think I've made any friends at school. None that have lasted more than a few months, anyway. nnSince set work overwhelmed me I thought I'd try writing. But when I write I get sad because I get jealous of my own characters.

I don't want to be anymore. I want Covid go be over so I can at least go out and try to make friends again. But even when it does end, I won't be at school anymore.

I have to be introduced to someone several times and have “safe” interactions to take them off the “fear list” in my head. I’ve worked on all kinds of grounding skills and I know I tend to land on freeze or dissociative responses to my social anxiety. I want to be independent but I struggle with simple tasks.

Everything was going fine until the doctor injected the anesthesia. My right foot became numb pretty quickly, but the left one didn't. I told my doctor this and he gave me another injection and left for five minutes. While he was gone, I suddenly started getting really anxious because my fucking foot wasn't getting completely numb yet and I feared my doctor would get annoyed because I was delaying the procedure so much. It's such a dumb thing but I started panicking and when he returned, I was too overwhelmed with anxiety to say something about my foot. nnThen he started to poke under my nail and I could feel a small sting. My toe was mildly numb, but I could feel some pain when touched. I wanted to say something, but I feared it was too late since a little bit of blood started to come out and he had already taken out the other nail on my right foot.nnI don't know how I did it, but I somehow managed to power through the procedure without crying in pain.

6985,"RectilProjectil","post","I'm a teen with social anxiety and panic disorder, just wanted to get this all off my chest","So I'm a 14 year old boy and for the past couple years my anxiety has gotten worse and worse. last year was my first year of highschool (I'm Australian), and I was mostly normal. But as the year went on I slowly started to feel more and more anxiety in every day interactions. I started secluding myself more at school, like I would just sit in the library for the entirety of recess and lunch, stopped talking to people unless I had to, this just got worse and worse every day until the point where I couldn't even look at someone in the eyes without feeling sick to my stomach. It took me a year but towards the end of 2020 I got myself to tell my dad about it, he was very understanding and set up an appointment with a doctor. When we went there I told the doctor everything and he diagnosed me with very severe social anxiety disorder and mild generalized anxiety disorder, he also wrote up a referral to a psychiatry clinic. after that literally NOTHING happened, that place we were referred too was fully booked just like every single other clinic so that was great. So at that time it was January in the summer holidays and nothing happened until school started again, now when school started this year is when my life went to shit. So it was a Friday, went to the first day of school, great day, went home, yay!  Then it was Monday, went to school, went great for a bit, got an assignment in English where we had to interview people and record it and then show it too the class. I started to feel sick in the stomach, I was breathing heavy, I started shaking, my hands got this buzzy feeling in them, and then suddenly I went into this TERRIFYING state of panic and anxiety, I thought I was dying, I thought this was it. My friends looked over at me, at first they were smiling, like: ""haha whata you doin Lukas?"" then it got worse, they started to panic too and took me to the office, my dad got there and took me home. It was extremely traumatic, after that incident the school got us in touch with a psychiatrist and scheduled an appointment for the next week, so I took a day of school and came back the day after that thinking that it was only a one time thing, within an hour of being at school I had another panic attack. From then on I nearly had a panic attack EVERY day I was at school, it was horific. I've lost track of how many I've had, but its been ALOT. At that time I started therapy which helped abit with the panic attacks, I mean but that's only because of this protocol that was put in place for me, my anxiety was still the same. After a while the attacks started thinning out and I was eventually put on anti-depressants, Sertraline I think its called, I think that's helped a bit but I don't really know. Now we're at the present, I've only had a couple panic attacks, I've been getting more confident and happy, and then today happened. Today I had the worst panic attack of my life, When I had it there were so many people just watching me helplessly, they had no idea what to do, finally a teacher came and brought me into the teachers office, which was full of teachers... Who had no idea what to do, eventually they called my dad, my dad happened to be in Melbourne (the big city), called my mum, she didn't pick up, called my step mom, she picked up, yay! But of coarse my little brother and sister were with her ( both 5 years old ), so it takes her ages to arrive. So basically I was having the worst panic attack of my life infront of multiple helpless teachers and HEAPS of students, who are just staring at me, waiting for my step mom to arrive. So now I'm here writing this, I am feeling the worst I've ever felt, its been a year of hell which I've finally basically recovered from, and then it all got taken away from me today. I'm just grateful that I have such loving parents who actually love me and are helping me through this. So yea, that's me, just wanted to get this all of my chest, if anyone has any advice with coping with this shit then I would be so very grateful, Thanks."

I always just want to cry and run away as soon as someone new starts talking to me. I don't know how i'm still surviving in this world to be honest. I've been in and out of 2 different psychiatric hospitals after developing psychosis from being extremely lonely with an overactive and impulsive mind.

Until yesterday (which was not that bad) and today:nnMy yearly doctor appointment was today, I’m so scared of needles. I cried 4 different times through the appointment because I was so scared of the shots and blood work. I felt so dumb and like I was over reacting because not even the little kids or babies were crying like me. And I didn’t even get the shots I have to come back in 10 or more days. After im 16.

My counselor said that she thinks it is helping. (Which I think so too… I mean I’ve made a friend! And had felt happier) I thought they would see it’s helping but today they told me again how they are going to take me out of counseling because I’ve made not even one improvement. (It’s only been 8 sessions) they make me feel like I’m crazy and not even trying. I’m trying so hard. nnI suggested family counseling (there’s many other stuff that happened today when we talked, it was like a huge discussion, they are mad at me and they think I’m ungrateful probably crazy. )They said I have good health, can talk, walk etc while others can’t. So it makes me feel like my feelings are small compared to others and that they don’t matter… now realize I’m not ready for family counseling… I’m scared my parents and brother will judge me and not understand me. There’s no way I’ll be able to talk in front of them all, I couldn’t even express all my feelings, even though I did say a lot, and more than I thought I would be able to say during counseling) in front of one counselor which I know won’t judge me. I don’t know how I will be able to do it in front of a new counselor and 3 other people who probably will think I’m crazy. Worse of all is that I know they probably won’t understand because I’ve tried telling them stuff before through text. nnThey want to do family counseling online, that’s even worse I don’t know why I find it harder and scarier that way.

When asked this, I always say “A lot older than you probably think” to try and ease their inevitable shock before I tell them my age. I said that, paused, and then said “I’m 19.” nnUgh. The reaction is always the same. “Oh...WOW. I thought you were 12!” (Sometimes they say 13 if I’m lucky...)nnI never developed during puberty. The only physical change was menstruation, body hair, and sweatiness. I never grew after 6th grade. I started developing breasts in middle school but they never actually turned into anything, so I don’t normally wear bras since none of them fit. I have 3 bras to my name. All too big for me, but they’re padded push-up bras and I wear them in hopes that I’ll look at least 12 and not 10 (I’ll wear them in classes or at the barn, etc.) My voice often gets mistaken for a little kid. When I, on the rare occasion, meet women around my age who are my height, they always have a much deeper voice. You can tell their age usually. I know everyone thinks their voice is high-pitched and annoying, but I do voice-recordings all the time for classes. I’ve gotten used to my voice and I know what it sounds like.nnWhen I was 14, my doctors had me tested (bone x-rays and blood test) because they were so concerned. They found nothing wrong with me. My relatives are relatively short but not to my extent, and relatives my age don’t look like little kids. nnAnd I’m so fucking sick of the “teehee, you’ll be glad when you’re older!” I get from middle-aged women who are miserable with their wrinkles and gray hairs. When I was 14, people thought I was 12. When I was 15, people thought I was 12. When I was 16? 12. 17? 12. 18? 12. 19? You guessed it, still 12. I’m screwed. I don’t even have good skin genes, it’s all thin and easily sags around my mouth (thanks mom), so it’s not like I’m gonna be some rare beauty when I’m older. There is no upside to this. I’m tired."

It was much worse back then but I’ve been able to keep it under control for the most part with therapy and medication. I still get pretty anxious but I can bear with it. nnSo I met this girl on a dating app and we’ve been talking and things seemed to be going pretty well. I find out we have a lot in common like she’s introverted and has anxiety too. I met her at a park to walk my dogs with her and I thought things went pretty well. I was the one that kept the conversation going and asked questions. I felt like I was doing a great job of being outgoing and talkative. She even let me kiss her at the end and she seemed physically in to me. nnAfter the date though she didn’t seem interested and her texts were short to me. I asked her what’s wrong and she said “I wasn’t feeling a good vibe and I don’t think we mix well because we’re both shy and introverted”. She told me she wants someone more outgoing...yet she’s introverted and shy like myself. I thought I was doing a great job of coming out of my shell and being more outgoing. It hurt getting told I was still “too quiet” and “not outgoing enough”. I can’t help I’m a soft spoken person. I really thought I was doing well. The fact that another introvert with social anxiety tells me I’m not outgoing enough and too quiet stings. Is there no hope? I try to make effort and I was the one initiating all of the conversation. It feels like everyone wants someone more outgoing and assertive even if they’re shy and introverted themselves. nnAnyone else experience something like this? I’m just really down on myself because I thought I was doing a great job of hiding my social anxiety and being outgoing."

Lately I feel nervous with common tasks  like driving, taking walks and even going to church. When I'm around other people aside from my family,  I  go into this robotic mode where I'm extremely self conscious about how I come across. I just left church and all I could think about was how to not look like a weirdo to the people in the seats behind me. nnWhat makes it worse is that feel like other people notice my nervousness. I'm in nursing school and I get strange looks from the staff and patients alike during clinicals. I get strange looks everywhere lately. It's gotten to the point where people turn red around me, leave or straight up laugh ( not to my face at least).  I think they may be laughing at how uncomfortable I look. I'm convinced I have this look on my face that shows pure fear,terror or confusion. nnMy close friends say they don't think anything is wrong with me, but it's been a while since we hung out due to covid so I'm a bit biased to their opinion. I've seen two therapists and they both say it's normal to be nervous and that I shouldn't care what people think. One told me to deep breath and imagine a calm atmosphere but that did not help.  I read one self help book called 101 Essays to change the way you think. It helped a bit but I feel the same. I have found some comfort from Scripture but  it goes out the door the minute I'm around other people. I recently got a job as a CNA and I'm nervous about getting the same reactions at my new place of work.nnI just feel that there's something I'm subconsciously doing that is warranting these reactions from other people. I'm not the first timid person to exist but maybe my discomfort is so palpable that it makes other people uncomfortable.nnThe way things are going I'm worried about my career and my  life in general. I'm doing fine in the didactic portion of my nursing classes but my clinical instructors stated that I come across shy. I may graduate nursing school but I'm not sure how effective of a nurse I'll be if I can't stand the sight of someone looking at me. I may be lucky to get job in an OR or Cath lab but that still requires some sort of people skills. I went out to hookah with my friends last night and I could think about was how people were judging the way I smoked the hookah since it was my first time. Crazy.nnI've been considering seeing a psychiatrist but I feel that they may put me on medication which I don't mind but I've been trying to find other helpful techniques before I consider seeing them.nn Also being a female with this much  nervous wreck/odd ball energy makes me feel susceptible to people with ill intentions. It's not good to be unaware about something people visibly notice.nnI'm open to any tips or suggestions."

I get so nervous around new people and in group settings. I wondered if I was autistic, because I was not getting better no matter how many therapists I went to (I've been to 3).nnFlash forward to graduate school. My social anxiety is full blown now. I'm in a small cohort and everyone knows each other. Everyone is eloquent, outgoing, smart, and mature. And then there's me...ugh. I made an appointment to see a therapist because I felt so depressed, and my self-esteem was plummetting. nnThis was the first therapist to ask me about how life was like growing up. I talked about being bullied in elementary school and...holy shit. I realized then and there that I used being socially withdrawn from others as a defense mechanism. If no one knew who I was, there would be less of a chance that I'll be bullied. If you know almost nothing about me, what do you have to pick on? I told myself it'll be better after middle school and high school.. just make it through as a nobody and you'll be safe from bullying. Kids can be mean, so just avoid people. I only had 2 close friends in high school. nnNow as an adult, I am withdrawn, socially awkward, and nervous because I fucking hate people, am worried others are laughing at me behind my back, and subconcsiously am worried about a repeat of what happened to me when I was younger. I chose not to talk about my childhood to my previous therapists (they never asked actually), because I thought I was over it. They were ""just kids"" and ""kids can be mean,"" and I move on, or so I thought. Now that I talk about it, I think this is the actual reason why I am socially awkward and nervous. I just didn't want to blame it on the bullying because I felt like it was a common experience. I'm so shook I can cry. I feel like I'm in the first stage of healing."

I almost never say what I really feel, I usually only speak when spoken to, I'm scared of making people angry. If someone says something that hurts my feelings, or makes me angry, I go along with it, because I couldn't possibly deal with confrontation, because then they wouldn't like me.nnI think because of this, no one really sees me for who I really am. I don't have much of a personality. So I've ended up resenting all of my workplaces, because I feel like this quiet, opinionless, uninteresting person. I'm so obsessed with making a good impression, and having people like me, that no one does.nnTo make myself feel better, I tell myself how great I am, and how much these people are overlooking. I fantasize about becoming rich, famous, successful, and I imagine their surprise when that happens. ""That guy, we used to work with? Now he's a celebrity. We were so wrong about him."" Then I feel above my coworkers, making it harder for me to make friends, because I figure why become friends with these losers when I'm so much better than them? I know how bad it sounds, but that's how I feel about myself in these situations.nnAnd now I'm depressed because I have no friends, and feel like a loser because I can't really fit in at any job I've had. So the gap widens between my grandiose self-image, and my underlying low self-esteem.nnI'm scared I'm just narcissistic. I told my therapist this, and she didn't think I was.

A majority of the time their feelings are invalidated and they are told to “get over it and act confident” or some other bullshit “advise” along the lines of that. But I’ve seen others direct anger, bitterness and resentment toward the socially anxious. I don’t really understand why this happens. It’s almost as if these people wait for anxious/awkward people to make mistakes, say the wrong thing, or act awkward in social situations and then pounce on them harshly for making these mistakes. I’ve had a friend scream loudly at me in a room full of others because I was acting quiet and not contributing to the conversation. Another time I’ve witnessed coworkers trying to listen to me over the phone because I accidentally mispronounced the name of the shop and spoke too fast when I had a customer on the line.nnI’ve never expected that being quiet and awkward could warrant such dislike, or even hatred from others. These types of people don’t have empathy or understanding for why a person may be a certain way. I keep to myself because I’m afraid that I may embarrass myself or say the wrong thing. I guess this comes across as me not caring or being apathetic. I avoid getting too involved in conversation out of fear of rejection, so I withdraw.  I thought that maybe in their minds, they see me as a deserving target to release abuse because I break social rules. I wish they could understand that anxiety makes my brain work slower and I make careless mistakes because of the constant brain fog and seIf esteem issues I have.

Having an emotionally abusive parent might've fed into that, but in general I'm just shy and timid. I overthink a lot when it comes to interactions, but I thought that was just my ""personality"".  I think as a kid I was more outgoing, but I don't remember that well.nnBut to be honest I think this might be more than normal shyness. I've only called/video chatted three friends in my lifetime, two of them were a one-time thing, and the other was with my best friend of several years, who's the only person I can talk to with limited struggle, as I know her so well.

I would like an answer, even if it means I'm just being dramatic aha. It's just very tiring to deal with situations like these, where I feel like I'm making an embarrassment of myself. I see other people effortlessly talking to people, calling their friends and other people, and I don't understand how they do it.nnBtw, if it matters at all, I am 16."

I dont thinks its necessary to go into detail but main things i struggle with are being alone in a new environment, doing something wrong when no one i know is present, always feeling like im doing something/going to do something wrong, meeting new people and a whole other bunch. These main ones are making it a struggle for me to find a job. Im 16 years old and currently looking for a job. My first and only place i worked was just a trial shift at a restaurant place on a beach. They told me what to do for the guests inside and outside, where to put dishes, how to make the teas and serve condiments and everything else. It wad fine for the first hour or two as it was only drinks being served but i realized i couldnt carry drinks without it spilling onto the tray. The cutlery was simple, however when they ordered sandwiches no one told me if they should be given cutlery or not so i did anyway. Condiments were easy up until i was told i hadnt put spoons with them and put them on a plate. Food seemed risky before i even started and proved so, as the few times i did serve i would forget what food it was or almost tip the food off the plate. I stayed away from food and drink unless it was tea and focused on cutlery, condiments and cleaning. I wasnt sure whether to take people finished dishes if they were still at the table, so i didnt, and only cleared up tables with no one on it. About 4 hours 45 minutes into my 6 hour shift, the manager sent me home with some money and said i wasn't really ready pretty much.

I am sitting in my room crying writing this because of how hard of a week and past month i’ve had because of my anxiety. I’ve been applying for jobs because I’m not in school. I began online school way before the pandemic started and I’m graduating this year. I cant do job interviews. I have to strictly rehearse what I am going to say over and over and over again. I’m screwed if the interviewer asks me something I wasn’t prepared for because I choke up and can’t speak and don’t even have answers to their questions. Obsessively rehearsing will be all I do the day before or however many days before my interview. I even have to write down what I’m going to say before I call someone I don’t really know on the phone. It drains me so much mentally and physically and it’s made me so depressed. It discourages me to even continue applying to jobs. The last 3 or 4 job interviews I’ve had, I’ve failed. I’ve heard “we’ll give you a call back within the next few days!” more times than I can count on my fingers. They never call back. nnI get so choked up whenevr I’m talking and I forget to breathe. I have trouble maintaining eye contact with the interviewer. I don’t have good answers for the questions especially if they aren’t ones I’ve prepared. The only jobs I've been able to score are the ones where there is no interview and I came in and they hired me on the spot. I need money so bad right now because I’m saving to move out of my town and my boyfriend of 3 years is coming to see me for my birthday and I want money to be able to do stuff with him. It’s left me feeling really suicidal at times or like a failure because I can’t do a simple task most people can do so easily. nnToday I had an interview at Journeys and I did surprisingly really well at the actual interview part and I kind of made friends with the interviewer. However, after the interview they made me go in the store and sell a shoe to a manager and I tried, but I didn’t know what to say. I couldn’t breath I was so embarrassed that I apologized to the interviewer, but she said I did a good job. I felt pitied and couldn’t tell if she was being genuine. They said they’ll give me a call back in 24-48 hours, but I have a feeling they won’t call me back at all because that’s what I’m so used to. Ive had 2 previous job experiences before, but they were both seasonal. I did really well connecting with my coworkers, but I can only do that if they start talking to me first. I’m good at talking to customers when it becomes muscle memory, but of course I couldn’t say that to an interviewer lol. I’ve tried everything to make my anxiety go away. I’ve tried disassociating and pretending it doesn’t exist, breathing techniques, I’ve even tried smoking weed, but it just makes it worse because I have drug trauma from friends and family members who are users.nn I used to be in therapy for my anxiety and PTSD, but I quit because it started making me anxious to go to therapy. I never connected with my therapist and he used to jokingly complain about how he hated his job and it made me sad because I felt like I was apart of that. I’ve been told SO many times by my family that this is just because I’m a teenager and I’ll grow out of being awkward and anxious, but it doesn’t feel like that. It feels like a deeper issue. It causes me so much pain. I don’t know what to do anymore. I just want a job and a reason to get out of my room. I want to be able to save money. I have a cousin who is 26 years old and she still lives with her mom and never leaves her house. I don’t want to be like that and the thought of it scares me because I feel like I’m on track to being like that.nnI'm sorry for the long post, but I will appreciate if you read it and gave your thoughts or tips on what I should do. I've considered going on meds, but I've heard bad things. Thanks for reading."

I think one of the big things for me that makes me afraid of social interaction is insecurity and overthinking. I always feel like I'm doing or saying stupid things when I need to talk to someone and am  constantly worrying about being judged. nnI want to speak clearly with confidence to get my point across but I always end up getting red in the face when the spotlights on me and move stifly. Apparently me being constantly embarrassed and shy sometimes sends signals that I am interested in someone when that is NOT the case and I hate it when people tell that to me or make assumptions. After every social interaction I always look back and feel even more embarrassed on what I did or what I said and just dwell on it for a long period of time.nnAny advice on how to start working on this would be much appreciated. Thank you!"

I'm 25 years old now, and I'm at the point where I don't give a shit if my mental illness eats me alive. I don't care if I have a mental breakdown in the middle of an aisle stocking merchandise or whatever position they have available. I'm just sick of living off of SSDI and having my mom do most things for me. I've been slowly integrating back into society by going to public places when I can, but I still get terribly anxious. Recently I returned a game to GameStop, but I think the workers there could tell I was nervous. Doesn't help that my voice completely shatters and I can't talk anymore for a few seconds. Which is what I'm most nervous about when I get the job, I'm afraid my voice is going to give out too many times and I'll get fired which would discourage me from working again. I have a therapist, but he's more of a buddy therapist, he doesn't help much. Neither did the past four therapists I've had. I've been on a couple of antidepressants, but none worked for the long run. Now I'm on a multivitamin, I hope it helps somewhat. If that doesn't work then I just hope exposure therapy will. I just want to get my own car and be independent like most adults my age are. The reason I chose Walmart is because it's close to my mom's job and we rely on my sick step dad for transportation. I plan on using public transportation as well. Also it's the store I'm the most familiar with so I think I would be a decent asset there. I don't want to feel a sense of embarrassment every time I go to a family gathering anymore, I don't want to feel like the weird loser uncle. I want to feel accepted, I want to have meaning and purpose in my pathetic life. I know I'm going to want to quit working at Walmart within the few hours of working, but I can't give in to my anxiety. My mom has health issues, she can't baby me forever. She's 55, smokes and is overweight. She also has macular degeneration which is a disease that eats away at the center of the retina of the eyes. I'm worried for her but also myself and my brothers because it's hereditary, there's no cure. I'm hoping I can offset it by working out and treating my body better but only time will tell what will happen to me. I'm hoping by the time I'm older I'll have enough money saved up to not worry too much about going blind. I'm hoping this week will be a start of a new chapter and of positive changes. If you read all of this thank you. I made an alternate account because I didn't want to spill out my personal business on my main."

The depression isn’t too bad and is almost always triggered by my anxiety and my isolation. I’ve always been quiet as a kid but I didn’t realize that it was because people made me anxious. Now I can’t tell if it’s gotten worse or if I’m just more aware of it’s feeling and effects. I’ve always been the stubborn type and I’ve overcome many other mental issues on my own. But this emotion is different. It seems that the more I try the tighter it wraps around my mind. I’ve been told that in order to lessen the anxiety I shouldn’t try to fight it but the act of not fighting it is only another way of trying to rid myself of it. I blow off my friends and family constantly and when I’m with them I rarely speak. I have found a group of very amazing friends and when I’m with them I contribute very little to the conversation. They think I’m just a quiet person but they have no idea I’m freaking out in my head constantly. I have so many thoughts, ideas, and emotions that I want to share with them but no way to do it.

I feel weighed down until she leaves and is finally done for the day. nnIf I see that we're scheduled for the same time, I feel my shift go by that much more slowly.

Somewhere along the way, my coworker took over and she said, ""\[my name\], just ask me. She's just a student."" And she asked like, regularly. nnBut then later on, I was having trouble with some billing issue. I said, ""X, can you please help me with this issue?"" And she didn't even turn to look at me from her computer screen, didn't say yes or no. Just stood there for a few seconds, abruptly walked over to my screen and irritatedly asked, ""What?""

And for all her cold behavior, she always gets shit done. What's worse is that she will be in one of the same college classes as me next fall. Just my luck, I guess. nnAnyway, I'm sorry if I sound whiny. There's a lot more that I feel like I could say about how much I hate being at that place, but a job is a job.

7240,"loquando","post","My triumphant battle with social anxiety and depression 🏆","Hello, my name is Logan and I am 20 from the US. My entire life I had an ongoing battle with social anxiety which led to deep isolation and self-loathing. I could not wrap my head around why I felt this way. I’m 6 foot 5 and relatively handsome (at least I would say) but I could never muster up the confidence to do as much as introduce myself to a room full of people without my heart thumping and voice shaking. It baffled me- absolutely baffled me; to the point where I believed I was inherently flawed for a very long time. Every waking second I spent wondering why I was this way and I could not crack the code. Every single stare and glance is taken as an insult. A person seemingly peering up and down at your outfit- possibly out of fascination- is written off in your brain as rejection. “I’m not good enough”, “they’re making fun of me”, “is it the way that I’m dressed?” are all things that instantly come to mind. You become enslaved with the thought that anyone and everyone is judging you at every moment. It’s absolutely crippling and I would never wish this upon my worst enemy. I had a mental break in February which consisted of insomnia and incessant intrusive thinking. I spent over 100 hours without sleep in which I was deathly terrified of entering psychosis. My mind had tricked me into believing that I would be sent away to a facility left with my perils without a soul tending to me. It got to a climax where I nearly picked up the keys to my car in hopes of driving myself off a bridge. At that point, I had to wake my mother because I could not trust myself in my current state. To make a long story short; thanks to medication and psychotherapy I was able to mitigate these thoughts and feelings- for good. I no longer take medication and I am living the happiest life I could have ever imagined. This is a message to anyone suffering with mental illness or social anxiety— you are never alone and as cliche as it seams, things WILL get better. Today my friend, is your sign to put down the car keys and let hope be your reigns toward recovery ❤️‍🩹"

I was able to work on dealing with my anxiety, starting doing better in school — overall my life and mental health started to look up for the first time in months. nnNow that I’m nearing the end of my senior year, I need to start looking for a job and ‘start integrating back into society’ (as my mom says). At the same time, I’ve recently been diagnosed with ADHD, am back in therapy with a trauma therapist. It all just feels like so much at once. The amount of anxiety I was struggling with before quitting my job was debilitating — to have to deal with that on top of my worsened anxiety about covid, social anxiety AND the anxiety caused working through my trauma all while in my final semester of high school.

I couldn’t point to one that specific thing that went wrong at lunch but I felt weird the entire time. We got sushi together and then went to a thrift store and then I showed her my apartment. I think she wanted to do something more but I felt so stressed at that point I couldn’t do anything more. She definitely wants to be friends but I feel like it is just because she doesn’t know anyone else at our university.

7302,"Wide_Golf1334","post","SA, dating, getting ahead in life.","So, I’ve been hesitant to post anywhere about this, but I don’t think there’s any other way for me to get another perspective on this. I’ll try to keep this brief. If you don’t want to read the whole thing, here’s what I want to ask. If you have struggled with SA and other anxiety, when did you know that it affects your life too adversely to continue to leave it untreated? How did you find your S/O? How were you able to make meaningful and lasting connections that bolster your career?nnI’m 22M and have struggled with SA and what I think is general anxiety for as long as I can remember. I’m also one of the only INFJ males that I know. I’d like to make a note that I’ve never been diagnosed with any sort of disorder or condition, I’ve also never been able to seek any sort of help except one trip to a therapist when I was 15 which ended in him telling me that I was “just a kid going through adolescence”. I do however have family members with diagnosed conditions like anxiety/depression/bipolar disorder. nnEver since I was little, about 5 or so and in school, I had always felt like sort of an outcast. I went through a lot of bullying, early onset of puberty, acne, braces, and general SA. Basically, normal kid stuff for most, but what made this hard for me was that I had such a hard time communicating with others. My family remembers days and consecutive weeks where I would come home from school so upset that I would just cry for 20-45 minutes when I got home. I remember this pretty vaguely as being frustrated that I always seemed to be talked over/left for last/felt belittled compared to the other kids in my grade. There were also a few that picked on me every day of my life from kindergarten until like 10th grade. These few dudes are what I think kinda me of set the hook for my SA, since they also made fun of what I said or did. And being an only child I didn’t really put up with that outside of school. This went on for years and eventually led to a very depressed 10-13 year old me. The cherry on top of that is that where I feel like kids from a larger school could have found a different friend group, I went through all my schooling with a class size that capped out at 31. Basically if you lost your friends, everyone found your business out and it was hard to escape gossip and rebuild relationships. nnThis kinda lasted until my junior summer in high school. Eventually I had enough of feeling tiny and flipped a switch, which is when I kind of became really audacious. I basically made it a point to be mean. Pick on underclassmen, make of whoever, all that. I was a senior and felt like I was top dog. I think this was just a phase because it wore off pretty quick after I started college. I also realized I didn’t like that person. I’m not a mean person at heart, but it did feel good to snap back at people like that fit once. So college starts, and i pretty much went my whole college degree without ever going to a party or social event simply because I don’t have the confidence to go. I turned 21 last year, but only went to my first bar after my 22nd birthday, and I left in an hour or less because I was so stressed out. I didn’t want to drink because I’m afraid to get intoxicated in public, have no confidence to go talk to girls, and always feel like people are watching me and judging me. It’s this kind of mindset that’s kept me single for 4 years. I’m just lonely at this point. All my friends are getting married, having kids, are in relationships, etc. But I’ve been single since high school and I’m running out of reasons to believe any woman would want me. I lack confidence, and I feel like that’s just it right there. Every time I start talking to a girl I end up getting ghosted, no matter how we meet. I’m more apt to think that SA might be the root of the issue here, along with other anxiety issues. nnTo sum it up, no matter how well I’m doing in life, social anxiety is holding me back massively and I need to break these chains to succeed. Im tired of feeling like I’m getting tunnel vision when I talk to people,  getting lost in conversations because my mind is all over the place, and feeling like I’m drained after talking to someone for more than 5 minutes. I know I’m an upright man with potential. I have an associates and bachelors degree, military service, and a promising career ahead. I’ve made it out of my little redneck town and am about to move somewhere more exciting, but if I’m ever going to move on and be happy, and become better, I have to attack this at the source and overcome it. It’s like weightlifting, if you don’t have a foundation and form, you are severely limited to what you can do past a certain point."
7303,"Even-Lavishness5251","post","Does it sound like I’m going to have to be on antidepressants for the rest of my life. Advice please??","When I was 11 I was diagnosed with selective mutism / anxiety.  I’m 22 now and have been on anti-depressants since I was 12.  Originally the plan was to take them until I finished high school.   nnThere was a year out of highschool when my doctor thought I was doing well and let me taper off the antidepressant. I ended up having a terrible experience 5-6 months later in which I couldn’t talk like a normal person anymore - very slow speech, think or function properly so brain fog and constantly felt anxious, scared empty and depressed.  My entire family was worried. It still scars me till today thinking back...  So I ended up being sent to a psychiatrist for second opinions and being put back on it.  Then feeling myself again months later. nnThere was a point where my mother demanded the medication wasn’t working because all I do is sleep all day, and because I wanted to change doctors because I always thought my GP was a jerk, went and got me on a new antidepressant.   nnI have been in a four month lockdown in my state and just sleep all day then awake all night. Sometimes I can’t sleep at all, for instance I’ve been awake for two days right now and assume it’s because of the novel I’m reading and so into at the moment. Which is weird because books should make you tired. Otherwise before this happened  I was reading all night, then passed out all day. nnFor me it’s normal because I’ve had sleep problems since I was young.  One minute sleep is fine, next thing u know no sleep for a few days. Then it returns to normal sleep schedule.  Whenever psychiatrist suggest something to help me sleep I decline it, internally I’m thinking IM NOT TAKING MEDICATION TO HELP ME SLEEPnnI told my mother this who had another one of her dramatic dialogues “OH MY GOD.  the new medication is not working! You never take it at the same time everyday that is why. You have to tell that psychiatrist about this!”    Which made me internally mad, made me think why does my mother believe in medication and psychiatrists so much?!  Just like with the antidepressant, I don’t need medication to help me sleep?!   Why can’t I have one of those parents who don’t believe in medication and refuse to put their daughter on drugs!  I thought ‘i hate being on antidepressants’ over and over.    I once had a mom friend who I told about these things, she told me she doesn’t believe in medication and wouldn’t put her kids on it, if it’s not doing anything for mewhat’s the point - she would prefer yoga and meditation.  And to me that was the mother I wish my mom was right there.  nnI don’t actually know if it’s helping, or what the difference is because I’ve been on medication since I was twelve.  But def much better than as a child, couldn’t even say yes or no outside home back then. Otherwise I do feel much happier than when I had the antidepressant withdrawal depression that one year. nnMy mother taking me to doctors at 22 makes me feel like a mentally ill person that can’t take care of themself, or a psychiatric mental hospital patient. My mother used to come to my door and force me to take my meds daily. Def mental patient feeling. So I demanded to take it myself, I’m an adult. nnMost of the time I end up speechless and have no idea what to tell my current psychiatrist. Kind of a selective mutism/social anxiety thing. But look how expressive I am ona blog! Crazy. As suggested, might as well write down my concerns to remember what to say. Otherwise I don’t really have any concerns. My mother pissed me off and makes me wonder if I could ever be medication free all over again.  nnAside from the venting,  for the one hundredth time I wonder if I could ever be medication free. Because 1. It’s annoying to take everyday 2. Risk of liver damage 3. You can’t drink 4. It’s expensive.  I hate it. nnI have been told by a psych that yes I will need to be on medication for the rest of my life, esp since I already know what it feels like to have a relapse. nnSometimes I wonder if I could try going off my new social anxiety antidepressant (been on new one for 8-9 months now)      And actually have a success story. Or is my brain so used to taking the serotonin and whatever chemicals are in them  for all these years, that everytime I get off I would have terrible withdrawal symptoms again?"

And I really need to talk to a counselor so bad because I’m so tired of it. But I’ve talked to her so much through messages (she gave me her phone number so I could ask for advice so don’t say thats weird okay please) I’ve asked for advice a million times so much that I feel so annoying, but she’s always so nice to me. Should I ask her if she could come fo the counselor with me one day? Or will I be too annoying? If not what should I do? Because if I go alone I’ll cry freak out and embarrass myself and there’s no other teacher or friend I trust that much to come with me. Do you think it’ll be annoying if I ask?

Then I said “do y’all know what type of therapists there is?” It wasn’t an awkward question because I have told them I probably want to be a therapist or counselor when I’m older so they probably though I was just asking because of that reason. Then after they  said no I said something like “I’ve always wanted to go to a therapist cause it seems cool just to talk yk? Like do you know those types that you just talk like just so you have someone to talk to?” They said “yeah… but what you need if you want that is to talk to us or to your dog hese a great listener” then I said “but it’s not the same. And my dogs can’t speak back to me.” They said “Right, but they are good listeners and know how you feel” then I said “But can I still go with a therapist at-least a few times to see how it is?” They said “no because it’s too expensive” well I tried to get help for my social anxiety/shyness but guess imma just have to deal with it myself."

It lasted for about 3 months. I was 16, timid and naive. The worst part of this job was my manager, she treated me coldly. When I went to pick up my very last pay cheque after quitting, she scolded me and said that my quitting had hindered her location. She was mad that she'd have to find a replacement for me (but it's not like I quit on the spot, I did give her my 2 weeks notice and I worked for those remaining 2 weeks). She was mad that I wasted the franchise's resources on my uniform. She told me that my future workplaces would be harsher because 'this is how the real world works'. Now I'm not saying she's incorrect, I know she was being factual. But this was not her giving me advice, because her overall tone was insanely condescending. A final comment she made was that she would never give me a reference if I came back and asked for one. nnMy coworkers were pretty decent. They never openly criticized me. But they automatically assumed that every mishap was caused by me. I never defended myself because I hate confrontation. Also, I don't completely blame them, I barely improved even after 3 months. Actually, on my very last shift, I didn't know how to punch in one customer's order, so after I got help from a coworker, the customer was like, ""it must be your first day right? Don't worry I understand"". Seriously, this man was so kind. I was so embarrassed but I just nodded along to whatever he was saying.nnDespite all the awful memories, I still had some pleasant moments. Notably, one customer asked out loud ""who made this [coffee]"" and I shamefully raised my hand up. I had a feeling that I fucked up somehow until he exclaimed, ""this is the best coffee I've ever had"". Even if he was just being nice, I felt good about myself for once. nnOverall, I wish I quit sooner. I could've endured less stress. I'm not diagnosed with SA, but this first job proved to me that people are always judging me, especially in the workplace. And I deserved their negative judgements because I was incompetent. Every time I clocked in, I knew my coworkers were not happy to see me. I knew the regulars recognized me as the worst employee. My self-esteem was at an all time low.nnNowadays, I've been well. The rest of my part time jobs were better. I refuse to work in fast food, or any customer service based job."

I asked to sit with my colleagues, they said okay, and then no one said anything and just kept on their phones and my brain goes ""they were probably talking bad about you behind your back, and now you here they can't so they're in complete silence"" or ""they hate you but want to be polite so they won't say you can't seat with them but won't talk to you either.""nnEvery single thing they do or say my brain just distorts completely to make me feel bad. nnMy brain is sure everyone despises me, I'm the worst, they talk behind my back, etc. Rationally I KNOW that they probably don't care about me because they barely know me, so I'm not important enough to HATE.

I was extremely nervous. I was sweating, dizzy, headaches, stomachaches, shaking, stuttering, nauseous ... Typical of social anxiety. In one of the classes, a teacher I didn't know asked me my name, and you can't imagine how hard it was for me to just say my name. I made a fool of myself for a change. Also, I had told my tutor that I had social anxiety, and I expected him to tell me something, but nothing. Nothing at all.nnWhen I got home, naturally, I was disgusted with everything. In desperation I have explained everything to my father, to see if he understood that I really have social anxiety and that I want to go to therapy.

I don't know how to act normal, everyday I'm just pretending to be normal and copying other people. nnI miss social cues, I don't understand sarcasm 90% of the time, I have trouble regulating my tone of voice and usually am quite monotone which leads people to thinking I'm mad or upset. nnMy social anxiety stems from the fact it's someone I don't understand, and that I'm not good at it.

My friends and family are pretty much all very loud, outspoken, no holds barred type of people. they say exactly what they mean and don’t care who it offends.nnI realized that my SA is often worse after hanging out with any of them, not bc they judge me (even tho they do but i try to take it all lightheartedly, call it childhood trauma but it works for me lol), but because of how they talk about other people behind their backs so freely, i know they do the same to me.nnThis has always been an issue of mine, for two reasons:nnOne, because i’m the lowkey “no drama” type of person, people always feel it’s safe to come and talk shit about others to me even though i never say anything unjustly negative about people when they aren’t in the room. So I know that as soon as I leave a room they probably do the same thing to me.nnTwo, and this is largely also connected to younger me subconsciously understanding that I’m likely autistic, is that I always felt like everyone knew something I didn’t—specifically about me. No one was outright mean to me like they were to my friends, no one ever had an issue with me. Looking back I realized part of that was because I missed the social cues that were telling me they were being mean and disingenuous, and part of it was probably because they could tell(?) i was neurodivergent or like, “different”, so they kinda treated me how kids often treat ND kids.nnAs far as my current friends, they are almost all neurotypical and I rarely feel like they actually understand me and how my mind works. I love them to pieces and they’ve been with me through college so tough times are insinuated but they can be really insensitive at times. just the other day my friend told me “is it bad if i say no one will miss you” bc they wanted me to stay longer when i come to visit them. i didn’t respond to them and i still haven’t because even though i know it’s a joke &amp; they didn’t mean it like *that* it has been repeating in my head for a week now &amp; idk why they would say that knowing me &amp; how my brain works (i have really critical/negative intrusive thoughts).nnIs anyone else finding these kinds of issues at the root of their anxiety? bc all the articles about social anxiety always explain the symptoms as only waning when one is around close family and friends &amp; being exacerbated around new people/new social situations but i kind of feel like it’s the reverse for me.nnTLDR; due to current and childhood experiences, i think my close family and friends cause my social anxiety instead of help to alleviate it."

I’ve had some family troubles and idk what to do :( I’m (f21) in college right now, and parent b  lives maybe 20 minutes away, while parent a is halfway across the country. I never felt like I had freedom growing up (likely due to the anxiety I felt asking my parents to hang out with friends) so I’ve really enjoyed college, finding my independence and just doing things alone and with friends. nnHowever, my memory isn’t great and I get overwhelmed easily, so it’s really difficult for me to initiate calls and texts with my family. I do with parent B pretty frequently, but with my sibling and parent A it’s harder and I get really stressed out—I can reply, and I’ll always answer if they call, but it’s hard for me to initiate. nnThis has led to some issues—parent A will text parent B that they’re done with me etc etc if I don’t reply in hours or don’t call in a few weeks, and they’ll basically refuse to call then unless I do. nnMy sibling is similar, and will start saying hurtful things if I don’t agree with what they say, then guilt trip me by saying I never call. nnI feel like this is what’s making me not want to, the extra stress and drama that comes with communicating with them, and it’s always hard for me to tell who’s right. I feel like I should call more but that’s mostly from the guilt they put on me—as a college student I feel like I should have the freedom to call when I want, and if they want to talk then they can call. As I leave college I know the frequency will increase, but I don’t think this is something I can force. I’m just tired of being guilted by them and forced to think I’m just disappointing everyone. nnMy therapist (who I haven’t discussed this with yet) frequently says other ppls’ feelings aren’t my responsibility, which I feel applies here, but it’s hard for me to find the balance of being a decent person and not taking responsibility for other peoples’ emotions. I feel like my sibling (who’s 25) was allowed freedom but now I’m expected to do everything right, like they were the trial and I’m just an amalgamation of everyone’s right answers, so I’m supposed to listen completely to them and take everything at face value."

Once at the assembly they ordered me to stand in the first row and I couldn't stand it and got anxiety attack. In tears I asked teacher if I can go to the bathroom and it was first time I spoke with them in this school year (in general they were first person that I spoke with in this school year, classmates don't like me ofc). I just can't speak, even instead of ""here"" I just raise my hand. When teacher ask me something during lesson I just wait for they to say ""oh, you don't know?"" and I just nod.

This is first time in my life when teacher wants to see my parents (I'm 17). I think they want to see my parents because of PE situation (I literally have like 15% frequency). PE for me is the worst of the worsts, I believe you can understand that. Parents know I avoid it. However, they don't know how miserble I am at school. They don't know that I puke when leaving house (sorry for grossing you out) and about my anxiety attacks, about bad things I do to myself and one suicide attempt (I don't know if I have depression, self diagnosing is kinda dumb). I sometimes tell them ""I really don't like school, did you dislike it too?"" and then they get really pissed of, they say like ""everybody was in school, stop dramatizing"". There were many times when I wanted to tell them about all my ""probems"", but for them it's taboo topic and overall they think I'm over exaggerating.nnI... don't think it's a ""normal"" school hate. Or is it? What even ""normal"" does mean? I really hope the teacher wants to talk only about PE.  Am I ovethinking? I don't post normally, because it cost me huge distress.

I am 19 years old male and I go to a small university in my home town that I grew up in.  I live at home with my dad because its cheaper and honestly I hate the idea of having a roommate and would really rather live at home.  I don't really have any friends but that's mostly because I haven't tried to make any. I had friends in high school and I found spending time with them stressful and exhausting and I really would rather have gone home and watched TV or something.  I have also never been in a romantic relationship which bothers me but again this is mostly because I have never tried to create a relationship with a girl. Rejection has always terrified me and at this point I really just have no idea what to do or say to girls.  I suck at making conversation with people I don't know really well and there are usually tons of awkward pauses while I struggle to find the right words. On the other hand; however, I have little trouble speaking in front of groups provided I know what I am talking about. For instance last semester I took this super easy math class and aced it (I'm pretty good at math) so I was asked to lead review sessions in which I essentially give a 2 hour lecture in front of about 20 other students. Additionally, throughout high school I joined FFA and participated in these parliamentary procedure contests which required me and some of my peers to give a 12-15 minute presentation that we practiced over and over again. Anyway I actually found I enjoyed and found fulfillment in participating in those events and I now really enjoy leading these math review sessions, but I still hate normal social interaction to the point where I avoid it almost entirely."

Yes, when I was depressed I didn't care about anything but at least I showed emotion towards not showing emotion... as weird as that sounds.nnSSRI's, for me, seem like a huge trade off. Yes, you can blow out the bad feelings (Social anxiety and depression in my case), but it takes away your ability to feel. These drugs didn't make me more social, but they did make me not fear social situations. So with that in mind, I never learned how to better myself to combat the anxiety. nnThese drugs made me thankful for the emotions that are evoked through social anxiety and depression. Now that I am weening off of it, I hate that I am once again, crying on a daily basis and afraid to talk to anyone about it, but I am beyond overjoyed that I can feel again. nnButters kind of nailed it in this quote https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-7558NYtwYnnTake with what I said with a grain of salt. These medicines effect everyone differently and even though I talked very negatively on Paxil, I'm grateful of the lesson I learned through taking it. nnn"

We both work at the same groccery store. and we used to hangout all the time going to movies , bars, getting drunk and acting dumb sometimes or just staying home to play games or smoke and laugh at dumb old movies or play games online. But now all he does is hang around with this girl of his. We know her she went to the same high school as us and she was sorta in our group at school but she is a total bitch and lives for drama and to start problems just like when she was in high school. I'm positive my friend is using her for sex because everytime we get a chance to talk and chill  which now is never as i never get to see him except at work which not even then hardly because o yea she works with us. he tells me how he is sick of her and that she bugs him and makes him feel guilty when he is with our group from work. he invites me to chill with him when she is there but i can't as this girl just looks to argue and i don't want to tell her off as I know I will and make him choose between her or his friends. his friend who has know him longer and works with us and is married to her sister is in the same boat as me. I really don't know what to do but to stay out of it and not be a needy friend. But she treats him like shit and he is to afraid to say anything to because he will get no more sex which is fucking ridiculous.  "

7561,"Rileylou393","post","I feel like my SA is ruining my life","Hi, I hope this is okay to post. I'm 17F, and I struggle majorly with Social Anxiety along with a mix of Aspergers, depression and extreme highs and lows. I am in desperate need of some advice from someone who doesn't know me. I was intending on posting this in the discord server I made and own for people struggling with mental health but ironically I couldn't get over the fear of people judging me for ranting in my own server (laughing in pain), so here I am. My current situation is that I am a year and two months into an art college course. I have eight months to go to get my diploma. Easy right? I've come this far, I can do the rest. Except, I can't. Every day that I'm there, I sit alone, trying to get my work done but for some reason I feel like absolute shit every second of every day spent there. I can't nearly begin to explain how it feels, the best I can describe it is as a physical heaviness on my chest, different from my normal anxiety. Even just thinking back to the feelings is enough to send me into panic.nn I mentioned at the beginning of this post that I deal with extreme highs and lows, and what I mean by this is that I have two bigger moods in my daily life, (high and low) and then I have normal mood me which for a while I didn't think existed but following therapy I have discovered that that middle mood is there. When I'm experiencing a high, it's almost as if I switch into a completely different person, like an extrovert. I start cracking jokes in front of people, I participate in all conversations, I feel confident and on top of the world, I feel restless and hyperactive. Having a high is completely random, there's no triggers that I've noticed. I also haven't noticed any triggers for my lows. When I'm low, I feel worthless; sad; emotional; silent; slow; unproductive and I get urges to either SH or kill myself. When I'm out of a low, it's hard to look back and remember in detail what happened, as if it's misted up in my brain like an old memory. When I was younger I was extremely depressed, and I SH and attempted suicide many times, so maybe this is a factor in the sudden urge to harm myself when I'm low as a reaction to negativity? I'm not sure. My 'normal mood' is me feeling calm with not much anxiety and no negative thinking, which to me feels like a happy mood compared to what I experience during a low. nnBack to my situation - when I'm at college and I experience these lows, there's nothing I can do to handle it, I can't just go to bed and sleep to escape it, or wrap up in a warm blanket and avoid all social interaction. I have to sit in a studio with thirty other people, feeling like that, and often times it leads to meltdowns or panic attacks. I have tried listening to music; fiddling with fidget toys; going for a walk outside; watching netflix; talking to lecturers about it; focusing on work; taking a break from my work and doing different art; drinking water; breathing exercises; sitting in the bathrooms; texting my partner; planning shopping lists. None of these coping mechanisms work. One thing I have noticed is that I either have a low, panic attacks or I get that physical sad heaviness on my chest that feels suffocating every single day at college, which I think has created a fear around attending the course due to having no escape from these emotions and feelings. I've only had a high at college about four or five times. I do remember a time at the beginning of the course where I didn't feel the suffocating heaviness, just the casual anxiety around people. I used to have friends on this course, we were a group of five but this year they've expanded the friendship group, which is all the people on the course. Socialising with four other people was enough for me to come home exhausted and needing to recharge, but I can't handle socialising with a group of 30 odd people. Since then, I've isolated myself from the group - not that the original group have really tried to involve me in the new group. Another thing to add is that I've never been able to maintain a friendship for longer than a year, my boyfriend of almost two years is the longest relationship of any sort I've had. Is this just me, or does anyone else have the same issue?nnI went on holiday with my boyfriend and parents for three days last week and my god, I felt free. I did feel anxiety and some strong emotions but they felt reasonable because I was in busy environments like a swimming pool or a restaurant. This was great news to me because I thought, hey, this is what life can be like. Then I came home. Hell broke loose within me. I couldn't get myself out of bed to go to college, I haven't been there in almost a week and my attendance is poor enough as it is. I can't work up the energy to shower. I don't feel hungry. I can't even get up to brush my teeth. I don't even want to do art, I've tried, it gives me too much time to think. I've tried sleeping it off, but then the next day comes too quickly and I have to rinse repeat. I'm having about four or five panic attacks a day and a night. I'm keeping my boyfriend awake because we're both scared that I will end up in a mindset where I can't take it anymore and I give up. I can't think about the future without melting down. It's mental and physical hell. I thought it was because of college that I feel this way, that I've had a taste of freedom and I've realised that college isn't it for me. But I'm not sure that's it. I was going to drop out, frustrated and disappointed in myself that I can't make it another eight months to get my art diploma but was confident that I'd be taking a step towards healing my mental health. Then came the bad news, my mum told me that if I drop out then I need to get a job to pay rent because she can't afford to keep me here if she doesn't get government benefits for me. My boyfriend (19M and a full time worker) lives with us, and we're currently sleeping in my parents front room in the side of the house. We've already been told that if we don't move out soon they'll kick us out. We've been looking for places to rent but nobody considers us because we're so young. This has only worsened my anxiety, and I know that I probably seem quite pathetic because I'm scared of working but it isn't just that, I've worked before and I got fired for having panic attacks. It isn't just an unreasonable fear anymore, it's my worst fear at a job come true. nnSo, my choices are:nn1. Drop out of college to save my mental health but be forced to find a job and pay rent which will only  worsen my mental health anyway, leading me down a path of feeling suicidal for a period of time and then attempting suicide. I've been down that mental path before too many times and I don't want to die so this choice doesn't seem like a good one for me.nn2. Continue college for the last eight months, continue feeling this mental hell that I so badly wanted to escape. Get my diploma, be forced to get a job when the course ends anyway. Go back down on the same path of mental health and feeling suicidal.nAgain, I don't want to die.nnThis is where I'm stuck. Both paths worsen my mental health which I don't want. And I appreciate that not many people enjoy school or working, but to me this isn't just about lack of enjoyment, it's as if there is something in my body that physically stops me from doing it. You know when you have two magnets that are facing the wrong way so you physically cannot connect the two? There's always that distance as you try your best to grip them in your hands and force them together. That's what I experience in my chest, and it's not just an emotion, it's as if there is actually a magnet in my chest. Like, no matter how hard I try to just push through and do these things like jobs or courses, there's a force that won't let me. Believe me, I'm frustrated at myself too for being such a failure. nnAnd to address the paths of feeling suicidal, I'm not talking about it like that to be dramatic, I mean it in a way that it's my life pattern and I can't fix it, no matter what I try. My mental health deteriorates, I keep going through it and try my best to get through to the light at the end of the tunnel, but it gets too much, too many lows, too many bad thoughts, too much for me to take. I either take myself to hospital, or I attempt suicide. And it's easy to just say well why don't you push harder, try for longer. I've tried, either way I end up in the hospital waiting room. I've attempted three times this year, the last was this Summer, where I was in the waiting room with my boyfriend from 9:45pm until 11am the next day after being promised a bed on a ward. I was discharged within an hour of being seen. Having been so many times with no help or answers as to why I'm like this, going to hospital isn't an option anymore because obviously there's nothing they can do for me. It hurts so bad that there's nothing I can do to make this better or to make this go away, I don't want to die and leave all my pain to my boyfriend, but I want to not exist anymore, it seems like the only option I have that isn't months and months of torture followed by attempting suicide as a result of it all anyway.nnMy boyfriend is an angel, he didn't sign up for this when he met me and I feel like such a burden on him, but he insists that he'll always be there for me and he compares it to when I was his rock when he was depressed and anxious but he was strong enough to not give up, unlike me.nnIs this just bad social anxiety? Or is there something wrong with me? Does anyone else feel like this?nI hope this made some sort of sense to somebody out there. nnTLDR; I have two options of continuing college or getting a job, but both feel physically impossible due to anxiety and bad mental health. I fear both paths will lead to me killing myself."

I used to worry about that, but I'm 21, and at some point between ~15 and my current age, that all faded.nnnNow I'm just scared to death of friendships and relationships. I'm very lonely at times; I have literally no friends (not counting family members), and I've never had a ""real"" girlfriend. Additionally, I have some anxiety about my own family, to the point where I've never shared any secrets with them and I generally avoid them when I can.

I was raised by both parents, nobody was abusive, I got good grades, and we always had food. There was some bullying, but nothing that severe. My parents had some bad reactions to me wetting the bed when I was younger (though I was a bit too old to be doing that), which I remember only because I was scared at the time, but I don't think that would cause this either. I can't think of a reason. I was just always miserable and alone for some reason, and I don't know why.nnnWhat is this? I don't know what's going on anymore.

We met because she and I were the last two to find the classroom (it was the first day of class) and when we walked in she asked if I wanted to sit next to her to which I of course said yes. This made me feel special and since then I have yearned to get to know her better. We spoke once since then when she said something to me but I had never had the courage to start a conversation with her.  Yesterday my counselor challenged me to say something to her and gave me advice on how to go about it.nnToday I had biology with her and my plan was to walk in and as I sat down I would casually say ""hey, how are you doing?""  It's simple, casual and calls for more than a yes or no answer. I got to class early I walked in filled with courage but as soon as I got close to her all that courage drained from me and I instead just sat down at my desk and felt defeated. I then got up and took a short walk in the hallway to psyche myself up to try again. I did and again I failed to utter a word. I tried once more but again failure. Defeated I tried to think of ways to salvage this.  Then I thought of an idea.  We had an assignment due in class that day so I took it out and looked for an answer I wasn't really sure about then I leaned over and said ""excuse me, but I got X for this question. Is that what you got?"" She responded by saying something along the lines of ""no actually I got this"" and gave a short explanation as to why. I said thank you and gave her an answer to a question she didn't know and that was it. I had successfully completed the task I had longed to do for weeks now.  After the class was over we went to the front of the class to hand in that assignment and she asked me for the pencil I was holding to write her name on her paper. I gave it to her and when we left she said I was nice and then said ""see you on Monday"" and we left. I just wanted to share because this is a pretty big accomplishment for me considering after a year and a half in college I'm pretty sure this is the first conversation that I have initiated with another classmate and it went better than any of the many many possible scenarios that I played out in my head beforehand. For the first time in as long as I can remember I'm actually not all that excited for the weekend because I can't wait until I get to see her again on Monday."

Even posting this short thing is pretty hard for me (it's already been 30 minutes since I started typing). I feel like I hate people, but I'm so impossibly lonely. I don't want to talk to anyone, but I have to to stay sane. I have been going to a therapist twice a week. Not much progress. I feel like I'm a nobody and I'm losing it. I have no one and I push everyone away that tries to be there for me. I feel like I'm falling down a black hole and I'll never escape. No one knows me and no one gets to know me. This is hell. "
7647,"CrumbzID","post","Can I have some advice on how to be more outgoing and social for my last year of highschool?","The TLDR version of this question is basically the title, but here's some background about me:nI'm 17 years old (M), and my junior year of highschool is about to end. I have very few friends, because I don't know how to meet new people and start conversations with others.nnFor most of my life, until five months ago, I was a serious video game addict. I quit every sport I played by middle school and suffered a skateboarding accident that forced me to quit skating in middle school, along with the possibility of starting martial arts; something I craved to learn for years.nI've never been particularly socially isolated, but as highschool has gone by, I've become more quiet, reserved, and distant from all of my friends, driving them away in fear of being too clingy to the couple that I have left.nnI'm above average intellectually, and I'm by no means good looking, but I'm not ugly either (I'm skinny and pale, but I'm 5'11, work out, and have nice hair / style). Maybe that's just my low self confidence speaking, because my ex-girlfriend mentioned to me that a couple of her friends thought I was cute, but then again, she was probably lying to me. I've conversely had girls tell me that I'm disgusting and that no girl would ever fuck me (that's a quote). Don't know which one to believe.nnSpeaking of girls, I've had one girlfriend, and she had to approach me. That was four months ago, lasted a month, and I've only talked to one girl since (who flaked on me and made it very apparent she only wanted me to be her ""pen-pal"" even though my friend told me she had a crush on me).nEven though in the past I've been known as a really funny guy, I feel pretty shitty about myself. Every time I see someone I want to talk to, I feel like it would be better off if I just said nothing to them because someone like me couldn't possible make their day better. When I walk next to people in the hall or outside school in the morning, I imagine what I would say to them, but just can't actually make the words come out because I'm fucking horrified of them thinking I'm weird and ugly and starting rumors about me that would just make me feel worse. And every single time I don't approach someone to strike up a conversation, that immediate feeling of regret sets in, yet I can never do anything to correct it; it's like my mind leaves my body and I just watch the opportunities go by like streetsigns, hardly able to be read in the darkness. I joined a movie club first semester in hopes of making new friends, but I ran into the same problem of being too awkward to really make anything happen, and then the club got shut down because the teacher sponsoring it got arrested and fired for fucking a student. Literally (he was hot though).nnI've heard rumors about me before; kids thought I was a ""satanist"" - whatever the hell that even means, I don't know. I've heard kids talking about me behind my back in class. Some kids just straight up make fun of me to my face. I don't know why I feel like this and I can't afford therapy (both of my parents are felons and I haven't heard from my father in over half a year), and I'm not going to use alcohol or drugs because that's fucked, and I've seen drugs ruin the lives of far too many people that were close to me. I need some serious help: I don't want to be lonely the rest of highschool; I've resorted to internet chat rooms but they just don't do it for me, and I constantly find myself talking to myself and sometimes imaginary people to ward off the feeling. I'm addicted to self help. I'm not going to call a suicide hotline because I know the guilt of putting my family through my loss will keep me from ever going through with it, but the thought dances in my head almost daily. Plus, I don't trust anyone, especially those who're paid to pretend like they care about you, including therapists (mom let me in on that one).nnI've heard all of the common advice: ""Just break out of your comfort zone and talk to someone!"" - that's the problem itself. ""Stop caring about what other people think about you!"" - easier said than done when you have to see the same people every single day. ""Just be yourself!"" - but I kind of hate myself?nSorry if this all sounded like bitching. But I'm desperate. I need real advice. Don't pull any punches, tell me what I need to hear and I'm open to expanding any information needed. I feel like I'm going crazy. I've been checking myself out of school just to avoid seeing people, and I've almost resorted to hiding in the bathrooms for periods at a time to not have to interact with others. I don't want to spread the shitty vibe, and that's why I can only open up to this stuff on reddit (if I talk to my mom about this, she just plays the victim and makes it about her and it just makes me feel worse). PLEASE."

I've always just generally feared and felt inferior to others. nnI've been working on this in therapy for almost two years now. Therapy has helped a *lot*. But, it probably puts me at an advantage that I've lived and worked at home for the past year and a half. I rarely have to interact with anyone besides my coworkers and parents. I've basically been in a comfortable bubble. Not a happy bubble. I've been so sad this entire time, because I want to be doing something exciting with my life. But it's hard to not feel like a prisoner to your SA, even during good spells. nnThis past Friday was my last day at my remote job, and I'll be moving 1,500 miles away tomorrow  to start my new job next week. I'll be living in a big city where I only know a few people. The company I'll be working at is much bigger than before, and has a hybrid in-office &amp; remote schedule.nnI think I'm going to be really good at the job and am really excited for the work, and I think the company is so cool. I'm gonna be getting a really good pay raise as well. The city is so wonderful. The apartment I'll be renting is awesome. I'm ecstatic about everything.nnThe one thing I'm terrified of is loneliness. I've always felt like an outsider, and I'm terrified that it will be no different here. Don't get me wrong, I know there's no magic potion and that I *have* to put in the work to open myself up and gain confidence. What I'm scared of is putting in the work and *still* failing. I'm scared that that will be the proof I was dreading, of the fact that I really am just an undesirable, awkward social outcast.nnThanks for reading if you made it this far.

For eg. every day i wash my hair at least twice just to keep it 'dry-looking&amp;styled', because as the day goes on my hair goes abit oily. Another eg.  when i was still in college i had chapped lips from the nightout before so skipped college incase people saw me with it. ni know in my head people probably wont even notice the small things that i can notice but there are loads of other little issues that bother me, mostly about how others perceive me. nAm i just ocd with grooming or something?nn **social anxiety** --- i havnt been diagnosed or anything but i believe i have a acute/mild version of social anxiety. i cant hold conversations for long periods cause if i make eye contact it makes me uncomfortable, cant do presentations etc as i get sweaty and i cant look at the audience as they'll be looking straight at me. When im sat on a table with people im 'normal' but when it comes to talking to strangers, or even doing something when people will be focused on me i get anxious and quiet. when i went on a field trip with college, i was walking at the back and another girl was beside me making convo but i couldn't hold it, like literally at the time, my mind goes blank and its like i have no control over what i say, i just close people out if you know what i mean. btw it has nothing to do with the fact she was a girl, i can talk to girls/boys outright. niv also noticed it never occurs with complete strangers, people who ill probably never meet again, only with strangers from same college or class etc.ni dont know if its shyness or genuinely some sort of anxiety.

I need help from anyone who has quit the drug.","Two weeks ago I was prescribed Paxil after a terrible panic attack. I had always had anxiety and depression but never considered antidepressants. That day was different because I really felt like offing myself.nnAnyway, I was supposed to take 10 mg a day. On the first day I took 20 mg and had strong, weird side effects (tension in my jaw, ringing in my ears, eyes tearing up, CONSTANT yawning, sleeping 12+ hours a day). The sexual sides were the worst. I had zero libido and, when I forced myself to jerk off, my dick felt like a wet noodle.nnI didn't take Paxil for a while after that. Three days after taking the 20 mg dose, I was fine. I began to think I had overreacted, and took a 10 mg dose. I had these same sides again, but not as strong.nnThat second time (the 10 mg) was the last time I took Paxil. It was maybe 11 days ago. So in total I took 30 mg, or three doses. Almost nothing.nnSince then, all the non-sexual sides have disappeared. I do have some libido now and I can jerk off, orgasm, and ejaculate. I've noticed something very worrying though -- my erections are basically gone. I don't get morning wood. When I'm turned on or even jerking off, my dick is maybe half as hard as it used to get. Just a few weeks ago I would get monster, 8 inch, embarrassed-about-my-pants-in-public spontaneous erections and I was horny as fuck all the time. Now I just can't get a hard-on even when I try.nnI don't really know what's going on right now. It's scary when my body is acting in such an unaccustomed way. I can't get any answers online. I've read stories about permanent sexual side effects (post-SSRI sexual dysfunction) lasting for years after being on Paxil for a short time, and they're scaring me. I'm only 25.nnI would never have taken Paxil if I had thought it might have persistent side effects. My doc didn't tell me anything, and all my pharmacist said was that it might make me less horny.nnI'm going to see my doctor tomorrow but he'll probably be useless. He barely seems to know anything about the drug's side effects, like most physicians. I'm thinking about trying Wellbutrin because I've heard it restores and even improves sexual function. I'll also try different penile supplements like L-Arginine. I'm hoping someone who's been on Paxil in the past can give me some input here, because everywhere else on the Internet I'm drawing blanks."

I'm a 22 year old male, and have been suffering with social anxiety and maybe some other phobias as well for a while now. I've talked to my primary doctor about it before and to my parents but I never sought further help beyond that. I don't take any medications although I do exercise and practice yoga once a week. nnWhen I was in high school I had a girlfriend for most of junior and senior year (same girl), and really struggled with the relationship thing from an anxiety point of view. I was extremely nervous especially in the beginning about going on dates, especially something like dinner with just the two of us. I tried not to let on to her that I had these problems and somehow managed to have the relationship last almost 2 years until she broke it off. I found out a year later that she had cheated. I don't think the anxiety is why she cheated but I never found out for sure. nnI've had a couple other opportunities since I've been in college (this is my last year) to date but always stopped myself before getting to that point because of the anxiety that I had just from the idea of dating again. One girl now doesn't even talk to me now because I basically blew up our friendship just so I wouldn't have to take it to the next step, even though I would have were it not for the anxiety. nnI'm posting this now because I'm hoping for some advice on what I should do next, and am wondering if others experience this. As a guy I feel weird admitting to people, especially girls that I like that I have anxiety. I have a friend right now that I am really into and would like to maybe try dating but just can't get over the anxiety and panic symptoms to do it.

I live in a student residence where I have to share my kitchen with 6 people. It's been 2 months and I haven't used the kitchen yet due to the fact that I don't want to have to face my housemates. I have a micro-wave and fridge in my room, private bathroom also, so I either eat frozen food from the supermarket or I eat something cheap at a caffe or restaurant nearby, aside from that I've been isolated from everyone in my room studying, playing videogames and watching Netflix. nnAt college there's usually integration week, some traditional activities that the students do to help the integration of the new students, but due to covid nothing happened. So I've been for the past 2 months not talking to anyone at college either, the more extrovert people eventually started talking and made friends, but 1/4 of my class is like me. The worst part is, it is a lot cheaper to eat at the school canteen than at a cheap restaurant like I do, but I don't go there because my colleagues go there, and I don't want to have to sit alone instead of make conversation with them, but I don't have the balls to talk to them, so I don't go.nnIn short, I have been avoiding all social interaction in both my student residence and college. All I say is - Hello, Good Morning, Good Aftenoon, Good Evening or Good Night - and I jump to my room in the student residence or in college the same and than I stay quiet.nnAt my hometown, I have lots of friends and different groups of friends, I have a girlfriend, I hang out everyday when I go back home on weekends. I've allways had a good social life,  during the week I'm just waiting to go back home.nnThe thing is, if I came with a friend to this new city everything would be a lot easier. I've allways been shy when being alone not knowing anyone, I think that might be the issue.nnHow normal is this? Should I look for a therapist?"
7747,"dobby12","post","Guys I'm Taking a Huge Leap, and I'm Terrified."," So I always read that one of the best ways to overcome a fear is by exposure therapy and I was trying to think of an opportunity to force myself to not only be around people, but to interact with them too. Working in IT is not doing me any favors in the SA department. nnI always had that lucrative dream of just moving to a mountain town and working on a mountain and snowboarding all Winter. It's one of my biggest passions and there is nothing more relaxing in my mind. Except I knew that my SA would keep me from packing up everything I own and move away from my comfortable situation in the Midwest. Even with all of that in mind I decided to give it one last shot this season even though I knew I would probably back down. (I'm 24 with no wife/Kids/mortgage. Now is definitely the time)nnWhen I looked at this as a big task it was terrifying, then I started to break it down into small individual task. (1. Get a job up there. 2. Get housing 3. Sell uneeded stuff etc.) and I realized that this was totally doable. Just focusing on the job wasn't too hard. Submitted a few resumes and before I knew it I had a job. HUGE pay cut, but it is a job that will force me to not only interact with individuals, but also fit them for skis/snowboards. Not only do I have to talk to them, but I have to touch their feet. nnThen with that set in stone I needed to find housing. With a dog, housing in a mountain town is a nightmare but I finally found a guy who is cool with my dog, has a fair price, and would do a seasonal lease. Nice! Two biggest hurdles down. nnThe rest of them are fairly easy (Other than an affordable way to move my stuff up there w/o owning a truck...).nnBut it's a good (or bad?) thing I already signed my lease because I just saw a picture on my company's facebook of an employee fitting boots for a little kid and It really [startled](http://gifstorage.net/go?http://33.media.tumblr.com/a24dce3edcd151ae1db84e9495daa3dd/tumblr_msa2s7UzG11sx49sto1_400.gif) me. I know this will be good for me but all the sudden I find myself listing out different conversation topics to have with 5 year olds XD.nnI'm so damn nervous but if there is anything that you guys can take away from this, its to break up the nerve wracking tasks of a social situation into little chunks and remember that simply showing up to a situation that makes you uncomfortable should be viewed at as a victory. nnTL;DR: Working job in IT that tailors to my SA. Quitting and moving across country to work on a mountain at a job that will really push my SA limits. "
7750,"Wyndcaller","post","I don't really know what to do...","Hi... I wanted to go ahead and post something and try to vent my feelings, and I'm sure there's a lot of you guys who can understand how I feel. I'm really new here, and I was just browsing some sub-reddits until I discovered this place, and it was a great thing that I did since I had been seeking to try to share these feelings.nnI'm an 18 year old female, and I was raised home schooled. My anxiety has been present for years, and I'm not quite sure how long, though it's been worst at this stage in my life. I don't really know if it's part of being somewhat young and still growing, or if I have some sort of condition or if I have legitimate social anxiety. It's worth noting that my brother has Asperger's syndrome and my father is bipolar, though. Sadly, I have a lot of past memories with things that have happened in the family that have caused much emotional pain, and my anxiety has been worsened by some of those past events, but I still love my family very much and I know deep-down that they love me too, and I know they're struggling with anxiety and stress as well.nnThe first thing I want to mention, though is that I have some very close friends online, and I feel comfortable with talking to them pretty much no matter what's going on. They are very supportive of me, and I appreciate them so much, but I often try to share my feelings with them and sometimes I still get kind of down on myself about mistakes I've made or things I didn't do as well as I wanted to, but in spite of my depressed moods sometimes, they've been loyal to me.nnOne of my worst struggles with my anxiety is that I can get *extremely* self-conscious when I try to play games with my friends, though. I've never been able to play any game competitively because I get too worried about how I'm going to be doing, and with any sort of game, I struggle with those thoughts. Sometimes I feel like I'm not doing well enough and that my friends might not be enjoying playing with me, even though they tell me they do all of the time, but I still can't tell my anxiety to stop and leave me alone.nnI often hear things in my head like ""Oh, look, you're behind again."" ""You're not even doing this right."" and ""Just do something."" and things like that... It's very upsetting and it's almost like my mind is abusing me sometimes, and it drives me crazy. I wish I could tell my anxiety to stop lying to me.nnAlso, I guess this is normal to an extent, but sometimes, If I'm in voice chats, with certain people I feel uncomfortable and sometimes I start feeling embarrassed whenever I don't know what to say. There are some people I am very close to where I don't feel comfortable voice chatting with, though.nnThe worst anxiety trigger for me, though, is talking to people in real life. I go to a church where I have some close friends and it has a very supporting community, and I've been trying to hang out with some of the other youth there, but sometimes when I'm talking or when I meet a new person at the group, I get shaky and I start fidgeting with adjusting my clothing, checking my watch, rummaging through my pockets, and sometimes I get so nervous that I can't maintain eye contact for as long as I want, meanwhile, all of the time that it is happening, I keep feeling terrible and hoping that I'm not making anyone afraid or uncomfortable. I hear things in my head like ""Stop. You're being weird."" and I try to stay calm and try not to fidget, but whenever I hear things like that in my head, it makes me sad and it makes me hope even more that I'm not making my friend or acquaintance uncomfortable.nnSometimes I apologize to people for my behavior, and I try to make sure people know that I have social anxiety and that I cannot stop the fidgeting and that I get nervous, even though I sincerely enjoy talking to people that are supporting and kind to me. A few of my friends have recommended that I go and seek counseling or some therapy so that I can share my feelings with someone who can professionally help me feel better about myself, and I think I might if it gets worse.nnI don't really know if I'm really acting as weird as I feel, I don't really know if I'm worrying too much about my skill when I'm trying to play with others, and honestly I think I worry too much about things like that. I've seen a lot of things happen in my life that have proven me that I keep underestimating myself, but I know you guys understand these feelings, and honestly, I'm so glad that the internet has been able to be such a great place of support for me and for other people. I don't really know if I'm feeling this way because I haven't really been raised with much interaction with other people or if I really have some sort of condition, but regardless, my anxiety can be very distressing to me.nnThe last time I struggled with it was recently. I was playing Garry's Mod with a friend of mine, and some of you that might play video games might know that it is a sandbox game that you can play any way you can. There was no real reason for me to feel sad while I was playing it, but I did. I just kept overthinking and feeling anxious if I wasn't participating enough and I started hearing those mean voices again in my head, and for some reason I had a bit of a breakdown. After that, I wiped my tears away, and for the first time that I've had anxiety during a game, I was able to move on through it and I kept keeping my mind on positive things, and for some reason that helped significantly and I was able to mostly mute those negative thoughts and voices in my head, and I kept in mind all of the helpful advice from my friends as well.nnI really hope that I can get through this anxiety so that I can start to help other people. I want to be a counselor when I can start working towards higher education, and so far I've had experience trying to help my father and my brother, and my friends as well. I'm just hoping that I can mostly stop the anxiety for good so that it won't hinder me from my future, and I want to be a better positive influence on my friends and less of someone who seems to worry and complain so much.nnI wish you guys the best, and I thank you in advance. Love you all and God bless you all, and best wishes to you guys! If you have any advice that you think that would be helpful to me and my family, I would greatly appreciate it! &lt;3"

My new boss isn't very clear and gets angry at me a lot, and the customers get angry at me a lot, and it's so overwhelming and I'm unable to multitask. It's a nightmare because I know I'm going to go in and face getting yelled at every day. I can't sleep, I feel sick all the time, and It's been like that for the month or so now.nnThe only think that helps me get through this is thinking of how proud I'll be when I stick it out till the end, and what my next move will be. I don't know how I'm supposed to get a non-stressful job as an absent-minded teenager. I'm trying to think of how to be self-employed, or a less stress-oriented job. This job has taught me I'm not all bad- my coworkers and manager and former boss like me, and I've gotten a lot better at one-on-one interactions.nnPlease help me"

I'm currently working for a hospital, I have a good salary, and the job is easy.nnExcept I hate it, it's extremely boring and repetitive, we're treated like halfwits and replaceable peons, and the management is god awful. I mean, we do work for the government, in public healthcare.nnThe only reason I'm staying is because of two great advantages: the high salary, and the fact that I can choose my own schedule, to work more or less, and do weekends, which is gonna come in handy when I go back to college. nnI know I could probably find another job with a similar or better pay, and with flexible schedules, but here's the thing - I feel like I'd never be able to do these jobs.

I think I have had social anxiety for a few years now (starting at around 14) and I am 17 now and it's only going downhill. So I am totally clueless and have nothing to loose I will list some symptons. PS: Do meds help? I've been thinking of going to a doctor.nnn*I get tired, not that I want to sleep, but just that I want to go home.nn*Sweating, hate this one so much :/nn*Extremely self conscious, this has reached a point where I am even afraid of looking (yeah, you read that correctly). I just feel like staring down at some point is weird so I end up looking around changing my viewpoints every 5 seconds which is even more weird. I get also really conscious of my breathing, sounds, just my enviroment, etc. I pretty much get absorbed into my mind and I feel like that I am more observing the world instead of living in it.nnn*Not sure if this is a sympton on its own or a sub-sympton of something else but a lot of the time I am chilling with a group I am simply too afraid to say something. Sometimes I am anticipating the moment I will say something for like 10 minutes and then I end up saying it really quiet or I mess it up somehow.nnn*When someone makes a funny comment about me I think about it for the whole day, maybe even the next day if it was really offending for me. Sometimes I even cringe of things I've said years ago but i think everyone has that. nn*Alright, wasn't really sure if I should add this but whatever, depression. This gives social anxiety just a whole new dark layer. Not going into detail with this one but I am sure you understand. nnI am sure there are more symptons that I can't think of right now.

I have never been diagnosed with social anxiety but I do demonstrate many of the symptoms. While I do struggle interacting with groups of people and being involved in a large social gathering, my dating life has taken the biggest hit. I am 24 year old male and I have had no success with the fairer gender in my life. I count any positive interaction with a woman as a major victory in my book. nnI work a job at a christian camp working with churches/schools that attend camp. Anyway, we have buffet lines in our dining room and a very attractive woman who was a guest this past weekend was in line in front of me. After a few glances at her, I just went for ""How is your weekend going?"" and she looked up and almost seemed surprised at first, but then started talking with me. We enjoyed some small talk throughout the rest of our time in line, she introduced herself to me, and we parted ways. Later in the night when I was attending to some duties, I saw her again and she said hello to me and seemed excited to see me. I was in a rush though and I did not get to talk with her too long, but it was cool the she went out of her way to acknowledge me. nnAfterwards, I felt great. I always picture interactions with women my age as negative (even though I rarely try to talk with them), but it was awesome to be able to just ""go for it"" and have a pleasant conversation with a fellow human being. Whether she was attracted to me or not, it is a victory in my book. Heck, I may even see this woman again because I plan on attending the church she came up with (not because of her haha). Who knows what will happen? I am just thankful for little steps in the right direction. nnI hope that this post is an encouragement in anyway possible. Just look for those moments throughout the day that are victories. It can be something small or something very big. Try not to look at the outcome of a ""risky"" social interaction or situation as your victory/failure but the fact that you tried at all. I'm preaching to myself here. Anyways, thanks for reading. "

The thing is, I knew there was something wrong with me ever since I was about 12; I just couldn't put a name on it. I thought it was regular shyness, just being an introvert. nnI actually feel like it got worse when I knew what it was. Coincidentally, I've been struggling with my image since forever; I'm short, chubby and can't find an haircut I'm comfortable with. I know I'm not ugly, but I'm far from my ideal self. And it's massively affecting my self esteem, and by extension, my SA.nIn my mind, I have an ideal self; what I wish I looked like, who I wish I was. I feel like that person could deal with SA easily. I feel like, if I looked the way I felt inside, I wouldn't be so damn anxious all the time, because I wouldn't spend all my time worrying about the way people see me, about my height, chubbiness, clothes, etc. and I could focus more on projecting confidence. I don't think me losing weight and fixing my appearance would cure my SA, but I definitely know it would help, and it makes me feel like a piece of shit for even thinking this... it just seems like I seek the approval of others so damn much, that I want to be liked by everyone so much, that it takes over my life.

7895,"suavejonny","post","Need to vent","A little backstory. I'm a 24 year old male and these events took place around a year  ago. So I was diagnosed (I guess you would say) with social anxiety pretty much a year ago after a bad breakup. I say bad because in the matter of a couple months I went from what I thought was happy and telling a complete stranger I loved her to sitting in a bathtub contemplating suicide. Although I didn't want to say ""I love you"" she pretty much coaxed it out of me, idk I guess to make her feel better. She obviously didn't say it back which was fine with me but the next month and a half was crazy. Just to save you some reading she pretty much broke up with me once a week on Friday and got back with me on Sunday. Looking back now I know it sounds weird but idk, I was like addicted to her or something, it's hard to explain. Like I said we were literally on and off every week for 2 months. Her excuse was that I was too good for her and she didn't deserve me. I feel so dumb typing this. Anyways the last time she did it I lost it and went off on her and she completely cut me off, wouldn't let me call and apologize or anything. The only way I can describe my feelings at the time would be to compare it to an addict detoxing from an addiction. Idk why I was like this with her. It makes me feel psychotic. Anyways it was so bad that I was in the bathtub with a knife. I wanted to do something. To cut myself or kill myself I guess but I was too scared. Which made me hate myself more. My mother found me. After that I had some counseling which didn't really help that much. I tried a couple different medications for anxiety but quit them because weight gain was a side effect and I had just recently lost weight from 225 to 155 lbs and the thought of getting fat again just caused so much more worry and stress so I quit them all. Now its about 10 months later. I moved away from my hometown to live with some friends that I really didn't want to live with. I Just thought leaving would help me. It didn't. Now I'm stuck here miserable and making arrangements to move back. I just feel like my whole life I've always been a joke to everyone and that no one really liked me. Not even my friends or family. After the bathtub incident people were super nice to me for about a month but after that it was back to normal. I know people treat me like an idiot because I act like one. I honestly wish I didn't make jokes all the time and could be taken seriously but no matter how hard I try I end up in the same cycle. Even if I manage to not be a clown I just come off as an asshole and no one likes me that way either. I feel like I've never fit in. All guys my age want is to be rich and have sex with multiple different girls. All I want is to be normal and to be enough for someone. To not be told I'm stupid or looked down on. I just want to be happy. It's so bad when I feel like things are finally looking up and these feelings come rushing back every time. I know this has been sporadic but it's just been a rough couple of weeks and like I said I'm venting. So if you've made it this far thank you. "

How do you even begin to get out of a situation like this?...i feel like im disabled in some ways..like im stuck like this...im currently trying to look for jobs and get on my feet and prove to myself that i can do this but because of my lack of experience...im getting nothing. Im just literally done with this shit. I have conversations with my sibilings who are literally the only people i feel the least bit comfortable around and when i start to open up to them they always say ""Wow, youre smarter that I thought!"" Its like are you kidding me?..ive always done pretty well in school and i feel like i present myself in a way where i dont look like an idiot but i guess people equate quiteness and shyness to stupidity. I just want to be confident in who i am...i guess i fucking have social anxiety..how do i get rid of this shit?"

Anyway, I was wondering how does social media, especially facebook, treat you? Do you have a lot of friends? Do you get a lot of likes on your photos/statuses? Do you get a lot of messages? etc. I was wondering because in my social anxiety group therapy sessions, there is this one girl who averages 150+ likes per photo, yet is extremely closed off and shy to everyone, and was wondering how that could be the case, if she truly has SA or not. I'm just afraid I'll get 5 likes max on my photos while others get an average of 50. I wouldn't mind if you brag about your response, don't worry about being humble"
7924,"jre11","post","I'm 19 and don't know what to do, considering meds","So I quit community college after a semester because I was already failing. When I'm in school, I get this gross, tired, uncomfortable feeling that I believe comes from both social and general anxiety (like anxious from the idea of schoolwork along with the idea of being in school around tons of people that I don't like). I get so overwhelmed with having work to do that I drive myself into a depression, and then I shut down. nnNow I'm unemployed, never had a job, have no license, and I'm not in school. I know I could get a license and a job, but I don't know if I could handle a job with my anxiety if I could barely even handle school. I have no friends at all. I have passions and hopes but I live in a small town far from anywhere where I could have a career in any of my passions, and I can't move cause I have no money cause I have no job. I'm just feeling so stuck. My doctor said I could consider medication for depression. At first, my health anxiety kicked in and told me NO. But the more I evaluate my life at the moment, the more I think, maybe. From experience, does anyone know if any meds would help how I feel? I want to go back to school, I think, or at least online courses. But I'm so scared of failing again. I just fucking hate schoolwork and I HATE that I feel that way but I just hate it so much, it doesn't interest me at all. I want to change and I want a life, either with a job or in school (or both). Would medication help me?"

I came here knowing one ""friend"" but he soon fell in love with 1000 something girls, typical Chad type guy.

But now I've about had it with this controlling me. It's time for some kind of change. I'm going to start a shock therapy by exposing my self to super embarrassing and uncomfortable  situations.

After me and my girlfriend broke up I decided to do something about it and I started seeing this girl after we ended up hooking up a few times at some parties and I asked her out but then she said she didn't want to see me again. nnnSince then I have gone on like one or two dates since then. One went well enough that the girl invited me back to her place after some drinks but when I got there I freaked out thinking that she wasn't going to like me and while we were watching netflix on her bed I fell asleep. I was embarrassed and didn't ask her out again and after that I didn't go out with someone for about a year. nnnI transferred colleges back closer to home and started hanging out with one of my old friend's little sister since we both went to the same school. I eventually got feelings for her and when I told her she said she was seeing this guy she was hooking up with. I got super down and felt like she didn't like me at all but we still hung out all the time last summer. Also after getting rejected by I decided to lose a bunch of weight dropping from 210 down to 170 pounds bc I felt self conscious about my weight. nnWhile her and this guy she was seeing weren't officially dating we still hung out a bunch one on one. She would come over to drink and then one night I got up enough courage to ask if she wanted to stay the night and she said yes. nnAt this moment I should have thought that she liked me and wanted to be with me but I kept thinking about that time she rejected me. I also kept thinking about how to make a move but I would just get super freaked out about the whole thing because I wasn't sure how to make a move without bringing up my feelings. Yet again I was in bed with a girl I liked but could not do anything about it because the first two relationships I was in ended with my rejection by them. nnShe then started to see that guy and they started to date each other but in February they broke up for a 2nd time. We started to hang out more after they broke up and 2-3 weeks ago we started to go out once or twice a week. We went to a bar and then went to a park later that week. nnAbout a week ago I got an invite to come over to her place and we would drink some wine and watched some netflix in her room. She then asked me if I wanted to stay the night and I freaked out again and decided to go back to my place. Since then I have tried to see her again and now she is always busy and I feel as though I fucked something up just because I overthink things. nnI started seeing a therapist once a month since december and I feel that she's been helping a lot with my personal life outside of relationships but I haven't really discussed anything about my love life with her because i feel embarrassed. nnI am wondering if there is anyone who has experienced something similar and how they went about to change their mindset.

It seems like every girl I try to talk to just doesn't seem to be interested in me or wants to talk to me. Maybe I'm super ugly, but I try really hard to look good.

With old friends (which she was) I am at ease. I make jokes when I feel like it and keep the conversation light.nnNow, this has affected me pretty intensely because therapists have tried to convince me that what I think of myself is not actually true.. but what happened with my friend basically confirmed all of my suspicions. nnI'm uninteresting, most people don't want to hang out with me, I'm unappealing, nobody really cares about me etc etcnnHow can I ever reach a healthy self-esteem level if people can do this shit to me when I've done nothing wrong??

8002,"Callumtwin","post","Self diagnosed","Hello  world. My name is Callum  and I believe I suffer from social anxiety, I'm self diagnosed. I'm here today to seek advice .... I've had enough of self diagnoseing myself, I want the world to tell me if I actually suffer from social anxiety. Let's take you through a journey of my life (cringe) I'm a 19 year old from a country called Wales. I have no friends, never kissed a girl and never had sex. This all started when I was a very young boy, ages between 6-12. I become anti social. I'd stay inside all day and play video games for hours on end, getting lost in the story and characters. Years pass, in school I'd only hang out with one friend called Tom. I don't call this person a friend, he's more like a school friend, a person you only see in school. The days he wasn't in school I'd go to the library on my own and read random books, I'd eat lunch on my own. After  school I'd come home and play video games all the time and watch tv shows all day long. I got to the age of 16 and I left school never seeing Tom again. I'd continue to play video games and watch shows in my college years, this time being on my own. Going to the library on my own, eating alone. I've now been In college over 3 years and sadly nothing has changed. I've spent more time of my lkf in the game world more than I ever did in the real world ... I didn't gain social skills from experiences ... I didn't go to prom, house party's and clubbing. I just stayed in my room and had myself for company ... now I can't be social ... when ever someone talks to me I over think what to say, resulting in myself looking like a fucking idiot. When we'd have to speak in front of the class I'd freak out and my heart would start beating faster and sweat a lot. I was waiting for the bus this one time, said this pretty girl sat by me, I looker around seeing the bus was nearly empty, all I was thinking ""why is She sitting by me, does she like me, do I look good, wonder  if we are going to get married, wonder what our kids would look like, I'd fuck her"" i was staying inside all the time so I thought what's the point in buying clothes ... I'm not going to wear them anyway. So for the past couple of years I'm been wearing the same outfits. Plain white T shirt, black shirt and jeans with black shoes and with a black jacket. 'My hair was also a mess ... no point in putting actual work in my hair, not like anyone's going to notice me anyway. Like I said, I have no social skills, I don't know what to do when Somone talks to me and now with the whole social media thing it's hard to keep up with trends, so I never bother  they're going to change next week so why bother.  I don't know if I gave  enough information about myself so please tell me if you want to know anything more or if I left anything out (like anyone's going read  this) so please world by what I've told you, do I suffer from social anxiety .. I need to know ... I've done so many tests online, telling me i suffer from it greatly. It makes me depressed. I need someone's view before I go to a professional ... please someone ... HELP 😢"

So. I have had social anxiety, at different levels, my entire life. I am medicated for it now and see a therapist regularly. nnBasically, there is a guy that used to go to my school. We have been talking every night for a couple of months now, and our conversations are great, and I really, genuinely feel something for him. We are planning to meet up in a couple of weeks (as he moved away) and hang out. I already agreed to go, but as the event itself rapidly approaches I'm starting to get terrified, on the verge of panic attacks, etc. I start thinking about it and then dig myself into a hole of anxiety and fear and decided that I can't do it, but then remind myself that I don't want to disappoint this guy because I do, genuinely, really like him. Keep in mind he does know about my mental illness and is supportive.nnI am hoping you guys can give me some advice, or relate to it similar experiences you have had. I am super worried I will freak out on the day and have a panic attack, or just being super uncomfortable and awkward and make him weirded out.

8014,"chocolate-miklo","post","I hate my job","I'm 19 and I've gotten my first job and I just need some advice. I really, really hate my new job mostly because of myself but also because of interacting with others. I work as a parking attendant in a pretty large stadium so I come in contact with fans asking for help or looking for a specific place. I don't know much about this job and I'm still learning. I wasn't trained for this particular job and all my coworkers tell me that you learn as you go and I understand this. Ive only worked 3 days in two whole weeks because I always get nervous before every shift. I worked as a crossing guard and in the parking lot directing others to where to park there cars. Now I know how to do a task when ever I'm assigned it, though anything else outside of the task completely throws me off. Like when someone asks me a question. I don't know most of the time but I tell them some one else can help them. The part that really messes with me is when I do a stupid little mistake and I dwell on it. It's not that big, though it really stays on my mind for a while. I just really don't know how I can improve myself. It's my first ever job and everyone around me like my boyfriend, my mom and grandparents think it's not a good job for me. I forced myself to get a job this summer because I was tired of feeling worthless. Today I called off because I get so nervous and I just hate myself every time I go. My first day, my dad told me he was proud of my but I don't know how to tell him that I hate this job so much. It's physically demanding and I don't have a loud assertive voice that you need for this job. I get home tired and I frustrated of myself for not doing a better job, it's really taking a toll on my mental health, I think. I want to be confident but I don't know how to. I'm looking for another job but it seems as though no one wants to hire me especially because I don't have experience. I just thought getting a job would really improve my SA and confidence though I guess I'm wrong. I haven't been diagnosed with SA and I don't know if you have to be but I know that I'm constantly conscious of my actions and everything I do more than the normal. Thanks to anyone taking the time to read this. "
8024,"daisymae12","post","99% sure I have SA and don't know what to do","I'm a 22 year old university student and I think I have social anxiety. I've always been the quiet girl, and I've been 'shy' my whole life besides with people I'm close/comfortable with. I've had some living situations where I've lived with 5 other girls (currently), which I've gone into knowing that I don't like, and I'm sure that I'm seen as the odd one out because I'm so quiet. I always think that my roommates and other people talk about me and how 'weird' I probably seem to them because a lot of the time I just can't bring myself to contribute to conversations, and I can sit there mute for a long time. I've never been diagnosed with anxiety because I've always been too scared/nervous to make a doctor's appointment about it, but it runs in my family, and I'm sure I have it. I have family members with anxiety, but not social anxiety... and I just found out that my biological grandfather (who I've never met) has been painfully shy his entire life and is now an alcoholic. It's always bothered me that I'm so painfully quiet, and I find myself retreating to my room while in this living situation (which will be over in August) because I feel so uncomfortable and awkward. I think it's gotten worse over the past little while since I moved away from the city/roommate I was comfortable with (but I still had anxiety then too), my parents separated, my grandmother who I was very close with passed away, and both of my parents are now dating new people. I find that I'm increasingly uncomfortable in so many situations, and I want to be able to have and maintain conversations easily, and not be so nervous so much of the time. I've been feeling sad and tired a lot lately as well, I think because of how much my anxiety is affecting and bothering me. I haven't talked to my family about how much this social anxiety bothers me and about how I feel like the odd one out, but my mom has made me a doctor's appointment for when I'm home in a week because I told her I wanted to talk to my doctor about anxiety, possibly medication, etc. nnThe weird part is that I'm not generally seen as a 'strange' person, because I do have close friends from all kinds of social groups, but this is just because I've mostly gotten to know them all one-on-one in different situations. I find that once people get to know me as the 'quiet, shy girl', I can't get out of that stereotype because that's how they see me, and if I changed (if I knew how), even more attention would be placed on me because I'd be so different. I also am in school for communication disorders and want to be a speech-language pathologist as a career, because I love language and working with kids. I just want to feel more comfortable and less anxious, and be able to open up and let loose (like so many people also tell me I should). I don't think I can just do it alone though, so I'm not sure what to say to my doctor, etc. If anyone has any insight or similar experiences please let me know! "

My post is probably written in a weird way and there are probably spelling mistakes here and there, sorry if it makes it hard to read.nnI'm 16 years old, my social skills are awful and I'm trying to understand why... When I was younger (from 4 to 10 years old) I used to cry whenever I made a mistake and obeyed to everything others told me to do, basically didn't even have a personality, because I wasn't​ taught how to be independent. Maybe it's normal? I don't know, but it looks different than how most people act.nnMy dad was barely at home because he was working a lot and my mom never taught me social skills, she rarely ever allowed me meet friends after school and laughed at me when I didn't know what to do, or when I told her that I was bored being home all day.nShe never abused me or did anything wrong, but I still feel like she only had children so someone will take care of her in the future.nnShe didn't have a job, now she has a job, but she works only 2 days a week, so she can't say that it's why she doesn't have time take care of my brothers and me.nnAm I a bad person for blaming my social anxiety mostly on my mother? And is it really her fault? She always chose the most lazy way to do things with a terrible egocentric worldview. I absolutely hate her as a person, but is it okay to think that about my mother?nnI'm grateful for my dad on the other hand, he's a good person and he cares enough to actually do things and fix mistakes, he actually tried to help me talk to people and to be independent and do things on my own, unlike her.nShe always blames everything on my father, they've​ been fighting all the time, since I remember myself, and they divorced when I was 11, me and my brothers live with our mother since then.nnAt that age I was just online all the time, I absolutely did not want to interact with people because I was afraid, the websites and online communities I used were kind of an awful influence too, like a little Tumblr just in a different language and format, I basically wasted about 3 years of my life ""trolling"" online (it's ridiculous), I don't know why no one set me any limits.nnWhen I was 14 we moved to a new home to a different city, after a few months I stopped attending school, the main reason was anxiety... The reasons for anxiety were because I was new, because one of my few friends always mocked me, I didn't have all the school supplies so I had to ask others to borrow theirs all the time, because there were 7 (yes, 7,  it's absolutely ridiculous! God is definitely mocking my existence! :D) other students with the same name as me, and they were all male, that's embarrassing, I was always embarrassed about my name because it's a ""boys' name"" and I'm a girl, although there's a""female version"" of the name (the difference is the stressed syllable), it's not very known here :/ nnIt sounds weird and unimportant but it felt really embarrassing.nnThere was a holiday and after that I stopped attendinh school.nOf course there was a reaction from people (but nothing surprising, teachers trying to help, some friends trying to help and mom doing her drama thing).nnAfter 2 months or so, some government​ social workers got involved (there's a law that's says that you have to attend school until you finish it or until the age of 18). and I was sent to a psychologist and a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety, I needed to take a blood test and it was awful... A bunch of vitamins were missing, my mother and brothers then went to take a blood test too, awful results with them too... nHonestly it's probably because my mom buys awful food. before they got divorced, my dad used to buy food, but she has the mentality of a 4 year old boy and would rather buy snacks and ice creams over food. I didn't want to take vitamin pills and keep eating junk food, but thanks God, they talked to her about it and now she has to buy some normal food.nnAfter that I needed to take some sort of SSRI pills, I refused to keep taking them after taking them for 3 months, they made me sleep too much and didn't really help either.nnThen a new school year started and I went to a really bad school, I was guessing it's anxiety-free.  No, I was wrong, it was stressful and annoying, the lessons were boring and rarely taught any valuable information. nnBut it doesn't matter, now it's summer break and I have a bunch of free time to fix myself, but it also means that I see my mom all day! It drives me insane, I feel so bad about myself because she's my mom and criticizing her is wrong.nnBut if some ancestor was a bad person, does it mean I have to justify their actions because otherwise I wouldn't exist? I don't get it...nThank you so much if you've read this, this whole post is basically me complaining, I don't even know if I'm just seeking to blame it on others, I know this post probably annoys some people who think I'm being disrespectful towards my school and towards my mom, I'll be happy to hear anything, I really want to know how to improve myself.nn(Edited because the text was a complete mess)"

Please help.","Because of my fear of saying correcting people, I'm lying (by omission) to someone who had filled in the blanks and had created a bigger lie than it was supposed to be. Basically what happened was, I am babysitting for two families who needed someone at different times until this week. I never got the chance to tell them about one another. I asked Family A to let me leave an hour earlier and they said I could take the entire day off. But yesterday, the kids asked me ""Will you come after your doctor's appointment?"" I'm all, ""What? Appointment? Oh, um ... I will see y'all the next day."" nnToday I looked after Family B. Then, I sent a message to Family A about something of theirs that is in my possession by mistake. Before ending said conversation, they asked me if my appointment went well. FUCK! I just said ""yes."" nnSo now it's a huge lie and I hate that. I don't like lying at all but lately it's been happening quite often because I don't go into details out of fear of talking too much, then I'm too scared to say anything later to correct the situation. I don't know how to get rid of that fear. Please help?nnThank you. n"

However, I am experiencing intense anxiety about a somewhat-social situation, so I feel that it is appropriate. I've been struggling with this issue for about 2-3 years now. nnI've never been the most fashionable person in the world, but I loved shopping and buying clothes. I used to go to the mall for fun every weekend as a teen. I would fill carts up online, and circle things in magazines/catalogues just for fun. When I was about 19-21 years old, I was the only person I knew who loved going shopping alone. I'd do it every couple of weeks.nnI have no idea what happened, but I hit a stage where I just kind of stopped. My cute/fitting/not ripped or stained clothing collection began to dwindle down to nothing. Now, I have nearly no clothing, and the clothing I do have is not flattering, nor do I like it. It's sort of ruining my life because I'm afraid to go out or go on trips, even to see my family, because I have nothing to wear.nnEvery time I go to the store, I feel immensely uncomfortable. I get dizzy, lightheaded, irritable, and my heart begins to race. I rarely try to go shopping. Most of the time, if I do, I just leave, even if I drove for an hour and a half to get to the mall. If I stay, I end up trying on a bunch of stuff, hating most of it, and become even more discouraged.nnI feel as though everyone is looking at me and judging me. I KNOW that they're not, even if I catch them looking. That's what people do. They're aware of their surroundings, so they're aware of me. Okay, fine. But I can't shake the *feeling*, even if I know it's wrong. I feel like I'm too tall and that I'm like a tower in this room with short racks everywhere. I feel like none of the clothing anywhere is appropriate for my age (24). I feel like I'm on display. I feel like I don't look ""good"" enough to shop somewhere. I feel like I don't understand today's fashion or what I need to buy to make an outfit that I look good and feel comfortable in. I just feel like I lost something. I don't know what it is. I've tried going alone, with friends, with my boyfriend. All of it sucks. nnSorry for ranting about this very first-world problem, but I really need to get this off of my chest. It's really harming my self-confidence, which has always been fairly low, and it's just making it so much harder to live life outside of my room. In fact, I rarely leave my room except to work and see my boyfriend. I'm just wondering if anyone's ever experienced anything like this, or if someone has any ideas as to what may help me. Thank you."

After reading some posts here I realize my disorder is not as severe as many here, but nonetheless it's still the biggest problem in my life, and has been for the most part of my life. nnI am completely normal in most social situations, and I have self confidence when it comes to academic and professional situations. I'm a smart person, I like talking to people, I like meeting friends.nnHowever, there are some situations which just cause a trigger in my brain to activate. And when this happens, I immediately start feeling like I'm going to vomit, I can't eat and sometimes I actually do vomit. It's not something I can control. Usually these situations are social situations, especially when there's food or drinking involved (like dinners or parties with people whom I'm not familiar with) and with girls. I was extremely insecure with girls during my adolescence and the problem has gotten worse with the years.nnNow the funny part. I actually have a girlfriend. 8 months ago I managed to have the guts to ask her out. I basically didn't eat for 3 days before our first date because I just couldn't. I vomited before I met her. But other than eating with her, our dates went great and she's my girlfriend now for almost 6 months. nnThe problem is even after 6 months I still feel very uncomfortable when I'm with her. Even though I love her and even though she's aware of my disorder and doesnt mind it / supports me. I get very nervous when I'm about to eat with her, and sometimes I have to run to the toilet and vomit. nnI can't stand it anymore and I decided to seek help. I'll try to start going to a psychologist or psychiatrist, even though it is extremely expensive here. I randomly found this place while googling. I hope I can get better and get good info and advice here."

For a long time i found it very difficult for me to talk to new people especially girls . basically i wouldn't talk to anyone if they didn't come up to me first and i do the most effort to keep the conversation short and not come up with subjects just rather respond .When a girl used to talk to me even if i had no crush on her or feeling . i would get all red and shy and nothings after that is good . When i hit 18 i finally had my first Gf i didn't know how i did it ,but i came out of my shell and i was finally confident about myself . I never talked to her about my real problems although we spent 2 years together . at the end of our relationship i became the old me once again. I wasn't able to talk about anything with her not able to go meet her and so we broke up . This was the moment when my anxiety seriously hit . I almost dropped out of college because i was alone and i would see her there with all my friends and i'm this pathetic isolated guy who dodn't talk to anybody, But i forced myself and kept getting hits untill i made new friends who helped me get up on my feet again a little bit. I decided to have a girlfriend again and now we are at the verge of breaking up (nothing to do with anxiety but rather insecurities). I rarly leave the house unless i have something that need to be done . I know many people because i live in a kind of small town but they aren't close to te point where i can ask them if they want to hang out. We only do when we randomly meet . When i get invited to parties i always leave so disapointed of myself . I always view myself from a third persone prespective ,as if someone is looking at me and is judging my looks and my actions. I don't want that anymore but the key is to identify my problem but i can't really go to a therapist . Can u guys try to read and give me your opinion . I'm sorry if the writing isn't well put together English isn't my first language."

I was always the fat anti social kid at secondary school (UK). But for the most part up until my A-levels ( not sure what the equiviliant in the US is sorry) i got by. The second term of sixth form though my life (what little there was) fell apart, i had panic attack after panic attack, flunked and dropped out in 2013. The next few years i spent trying treatment after treatment. Nothing worked. Untill one new years i vowed to turn my self around, i had just had enough. I managed to get help from a charity called the Prince's Trust ( UK based , recommend it fyi) inch by inch i have fought to beat my SA i manged to go back into education in sept 2016, doing a course that will allow me to go to university in 2018.  I started going to the gym, i have gone from 107kg to 82kg. Last july i manged to get my first part time job, which i am enjoying. But recently i have hit a brick wall, i just cant seem to create a social circle of friends, i mean at college i have friends now, but when i try to arrange things outside of college nothing ever happens. I also still have never had a girl friend. Im 21 years old and have no idea how to act around women. Ive tried, all i do is stammer and go quite, its pathetic. This feels like the last hurdle to overcome so to speak. But i cant seem to work out how to approach it.nnSorry about the wall o text"

It's always these coping tools that annoy me the most... i appreciate that people care but you really should be more understanding and caring versus trying to solve peoples problems. I wouldn't give a soldier with PTSD advice because I don't have any experience with such a trauma."
8105,"Madsneedsalife","post","Can't get out of my own way","Looking for advice.nnI'm a 23 year old female. I have never been in a relationship and I don't get very close to anybody. I've dealt with social anxiety and clinical depression since I was 13. I've been isolating myself ever since and dealt with this by smoking weed very heavily, though I recently stopped. I've gone on and off antidepressants, with very little difference in my mood. I've seen a therapist and she and anyone I talk to about this tell I'm just too hard on myself. I know how privileged I am as a middle-class white girl and that only makes me feel worse that I have all these advantages and I still suck and can't find joy. I am very easy to get along with and I have no problem talking to people I work with, but I feel like I'm not able to truly connect with anyone. I can't get out of my own way. I never hung out with people in school and I just started hanging out regularly with people outside of work this last year. I just don't know who I am outside of work. I don't know how to be. My mind goes blank when I try to talk to people. I've sort of/not really dated one guy and completely idolized him and let him use me for sex. I don't have any hobbies or any real skills. I played sports, but quit at 15 when I couldn't handle being watched and I've always loved music, but don't have any sort of musical skills. I read a lot of self-help books and articles. I know all the things I need to do: get out more, socialize, exercise, try new things, have self-compassion. I just don't do them. I have no faith or religious affiliations. I rarely went to class in high school, but still graduated somehow and I've quit college three times without earning any credits, in fact I quit everything. I really want a degree, but I always lose motivation within the first month or so. Although this may sound conceited, I know that I'm attractive and I'm constantly asked to model and I'm asked out a lot, but it doesn't mean anything to me. Everything feels pointless and I so desperately want to find meaning and purpose. I think about how easy suicide would be a lot, but I know I'll never go through with it. I don't know what I'm asking..nnI feel like a dumb, lazy, pretty girl with no purpose or personality, even. I have nothing to offer anybody."
8107,"claysun9","post","Old Social Anxiety Feelings Coming Back","When I was younger, I had symptoms of social anxiety. I worked through these problems with a therapist, and now I’m pretty much healed. But some things have been happening lately that are triggering some old feelings.nnI quit playing basketball as a teenager because of said anxiety feelings. At the start of the year, I went back to playing basketball. I thought it would be good because physical activity can help mental health problems, and I saw it as a good opportunity to meet other people and get involved in a community. I’m 23 years old and all the other players on the team are 16 years old. The coach asks me to give the other players a lift every week but as soon as they’ve said hello to me, they sit in the back seat and talk to each other. They always sit in the back seat, too, even if the front seat is free. Makes me feel like there’s something wrong with me. They get out the car and walk ahead of me into the stadium talking while I’m still getting my bag out of the car. I’ve tried small talk attempts but I only get one word answers. I know that I was pretty awkward like them at 16, especially due to the fact I had anxiety, but I’m starting to think they’re being quite rude. On the rare weeks where I don’t give them a lift, they make blunt comments on court like “that was stupid” or “what are you doing?” to me and no one else. And I know that I’m not a bad player or anything. I score as many points as anyone else, I don’t hog the ball, and I try to be friendly and encouraging.nnI just don’t get it. The club asked me to manage the team and wanting to break into the community, I said yes. Sometimes it seems like nobody cares about the team except me, and to be honest I don’t really care that much, I feel like I’m only caring as much as anyone else should. The other players often tell me they can’t play due to sickness or injury an hour before the game. One game I arrived at the end of the first quarter because I needed to find a fifth player for our game. I was incredibly frustrated because the game took place an hour away from my home. The team was down by 20 when I got there because we started with 4 players. I was feeling pretty down by then and had no motivation to play well. I sat away from the team during time outs. The coach asked my partner about me later on in the week when he bumped into him but never said a word to me. This really upset me so I refused to play the next week. They didn't take me seriously until I didn't message them with game details the night before. nnI trained with another team in the club the other week and they were so encouraging to each other and very welcoming of me. Too bad I can’t play for them because I’m the opposite gender. nnIt’s bringing some old anxious feelings back. The ones that brought me to the point where I was afraid to go out and needed therapy. Like I'm doing something wrong but I'm not sure what it is. nnWhat do you think?"
