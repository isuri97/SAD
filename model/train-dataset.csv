1,"Kavklayiity","comment","","Yes it's gotten a little better. If you want medication thats just best to talk to a psychiatrist about if you have access to one. I don't go to parties but If you're the one organizing it maybe you can do something where people wont be able to pay attention to you as much or you can stay in the background doing some stuff till you decide you wanna talk to people? If it gets too bad you don't have to force yourself to talk to anyone",0
2,"puchirin","comment","","just to note: if you start therapy/meds, a lot of psychs will not tell you your diagnosis unless you press about it. There's this belief that if the diagnosis would not help the patient, then it's best not to say anything. Some people take the severity of their diagnosis very seriously, others might feel offended to be diagnosed with something different.nnbasically don't see a therapist just to get a diagnosis because they might not even give you one! But if you express that you feel a lot of the symptoms of social anxiety disorder (you can even just say that you feel nervous in social situations, don't go out, etc.) probably your psych will agree that it's a problem in your life.nnGenerally, the main thing they look for in any psychiatric diagnosis is functional impairment. everyone feels sad or quiet or moody. The issues start when your emotions interfere with your ability to lead a life that's fulfilling to you.nnhope that helps!",0

Life in general is kinda rough but hyperfocusing on literally anything I like has gotten me through a lot. Purposefully interacting with a lot of people who don't like that you're awkward could help you find the ones who find it endearing or who make you feel comfortable. My fiance tells me there's no such thing as awkward unless I decide there is. I own my stammering or bad jokes or slow processing times during conversations where I just stare at the person while I think about what they just said. The good ones don't care about that. The point is the good things even if they're little and only you know about them.",1

But this year I'm walking around town, going in the pool and even tried rhe sauna!nnWell for me the worsr part of my phobia came when I was in college and in the years after I dropped out. I had anxiety before too, but I could still manage to go out.nnI have a therapist too, i'm also on meds and they help and in the last year I made friends here on Reddit.

5,"linkenski","comment","","Fist bump! (No that's not it)nnI dropped out of my studies december 2020 as well. I moved cities and everything at the start of the year for it, and thought it was rough and there was Covid I actually got some nice grades the first year, and the social interactions were never completely awkward. But then summer ends, we resume the thing. We had to look for internship, we had 3 new subjects and new group projects, and now... it just started going downhill, and by the time we hit late November I was no longer feeling the fire. I just wanted to quit, and so December 7th I did. I just wrote them ""I have decided to quit"" and they asked for some personal ID thing, and then I was actually in the middle of reconsidering if it was the right call but the next day I noticed they had sent an email saying ""You have hereby been removed from our courses."" and that was it.nnSo I've been job-hunting to no avail since then, almost a full year now. Part of that is laziness. But tbh, all of it is just anxiety. I'm afraid of commitments, I'm afraid of going anywhere that I risk entering long-term relationships with other people whether it's intimate or work-related. I don't like when people ""know"" me, and that risk of failure. I don't like the awkwardness I bring to social situations or people noticing me being nervous or quiet.nnI've wanted to pay for a therapist this year but due to Covid it's been all over the news how thousands are treated for ""post-covid anxiety"" and because of the healthcare system already being strained anyone with depression/anxiety can look forward to waiting 6 months to get a time. So I have to bite the bullet and just take any job soon before my fundings run out. This has been a relaxing year, ngl, but I'm pretty worried about how much harder it will be very soon, when I can no longer just hide.",0

7,"SocialAnxietyGal","comment","","My psychiatrist prescribed me a beta blocker which I take 30 minutes before an event or presentation which takes away my rapid heart rate. Before when I didn't take any medicines, I would drink lemon water before and stop drinking soda like a day before. Then I would try to focus my anxiety somewhere. .like if I had a friend in that class, then I would just look at my friend while talking because that was my safe spot. Or if the class couldn't see my foot, then I would just shake my foot. Or don't make eye contact with anyone, just look at objects that are near them. Or right before, try to focus on something that brings you peace. It's hard I know but I hope you can get through it. Wishing you the best of luck!",1

10,"Independent-Box5637","comment","","A lot of people are finding it hard to socialize after being in lock down for so long. I suggest therapy if it’s drastically impacting your life, or just keep practicing. Talk to as many people as you can and it’ll get easier.

I hate those comments about me being quiet, or shy, or ignoring someone because I feel too empty to talk to them. nnI think I have the fear entering all situations, unless I get more validation that 'I'm ok' like they talk to me first or I do something what I perceive as rejection-prone and they don't reject me and treat me normally, how I know not being judged.nnYeah my therapist wasn't exactly judging me how I spoke in the moment but rather what I was telling them...so I started to try to give more details on what happened.. but I wasn't really sure what I felt..nnI actually did more research and am 'kind of' convinced that I have avoidant personality disorder which would make a lot of sense of the critical and pushed childhood I had. I'm just trying to come to terms that I have tried therapy for basically 2 years now and no one could figure that out........

Perhaps try speaking with youe health care provider - they may be able to help or signpost you to another organisation (steps to wellbeing in UK can be helpful).nnAs far as smoking cannabis goes, it can cause some people's anxiety levels to increase (I know mine do) so it may be worth going without for a while to see if that helps at all, nothing to lose on that front really.n",0
35,"tinewashere","comment","","I do. He knows I have SA and he helps me a lot with it. He actually helped me going to the doctor's and getting a psychologist. He has some SA too but it's not major and he's managed to deal with it on his own. I met him on a chat. He's the best friend I've ever had. The only reason we were able to get together was because I told him I had SA and that we needed to take it slow with meeting up and stuff because I would get overwhelmed easily. It took about 2 months from starting to write with each other until we had our first kiss and officially dated.

We went over breathing techniques that I still use today and i found out exactly what my anxiety triggers are within a social setting. These doctors are really good and helping you get to the root of your problems.

40,"cashmang1","comment","","Hey uncool guy! nSo I have social anxiety as well but mine is a little different. I was completely fine in high school (lots of friends and pretty popular as far as hanging out with everyone). It wasn't until college that I noticed I got panic attacks in social situations. So this is my advice from someone who was ""normal"" in high school and ""socially anxious"" now.nPersonally, I would try to talk to your Psychiatrist about this girl because it could be a good exercise to open up to someone. If this girl is really nice then try starting little conversations with her. The more calm you are the less awkward it'll be. You seem like a really nice guy so unless she's a bitch i'm sure she'll be able to hold a good conversation with you.nA good thing to remember is that this social anxiety doesn't have to follow you forever. You just really need to take baby steps so that you don't freak out in a situation. So start by giving your opinion a lot in your group and eventually try to start a conversation in the group.nNot sure if your'e on any medication to calm you down but I know that helped me a lot. I was worried I would become a zombie but it just keeps my heart from beating crazy fast when I go out in a social setting. (I tend to feel nauseas if I don't control my panic attacks). The only negative is I seem to be a little more tired than usual but thats just because its keeping me calm.nnI really hoped this helped you and I wish you the best of luck.nnp.s. This was my first comment on a reddit post. Did I help?",1

I told him I thought I might have SA, and he asked me why so I elaborated on it. Then I took some multiple choice tests on depression and anxiety, and he could see I scored high on anxiety so that verified it. Then he told me that it could be treated with meds or therapy, but in my case, therapy would probably be best suited. And then that was it. It wasn't that emotional or anything, it felt like going to the doctor with any other more intimate problem really. ",1

He agreed it was probably that and I was told to get therapy. I'm also a psychology student so I knew how diagnosing worked and what to expect, so I felt more sure in it than some other people might.nnAs to when it becomes a ""disorder"", it has to fit with the criteria for a diagnosis and that's really only something a psychologist or psychiatrist can verify. I'd say in SA's case, it's probably if you feel like your anxiety negatively impacts your life and keeps you from doing things that you normally would if you didn't experience the anxiety, and also an inability to overcome the anxiety yourself. But this can vary A LOT and personality disorders and other mental disorders can also have some of the same symptoms as SA so it's best to get it verified by a pro.",1
43,"countsunny","comment","","I mean given that you can be medically diagnosed with Social Anxiety whether he believes it or not doesn't refute its existence.

46,"tinewashere","comment","","Not much better, honestly, but I've only gone to 4 or 5 sessions. I've gotten more concious about my anxiety, but how to fix it is still a problem.

I have a very hard time stepping out of my comfort zone, because the truth is, I kind really *like* being alone and on my own. My problem is almost that I like it too much and that I'm addicted to it.

51,"countsunny","comment","","Alright if you're going with the note here's what I would change: nn1) Don't say ""some anxiety disorder"", either say social anxiety or say your nervous around people. The word disorder often has a negative connotation to it. n2) No need to say it's your self-diagnosis n3) The whole second paragraph is pretty contradicting. Which comes with SA but might further confuse her. Maybe write something conveying that you want to spend more time with her so you can be more comfortable with her. n4) I'm not even sure you have to explicitly state you like her...I mean isn't that pretty self-evident in the note? Idk I'm not a girl lol. But if you are going to state it, don't need to say it was obvious. Just say like she's really special to you and you like her a lot, want to get to know her more, etc. n5) Not sure if you want to put the idea of being weirded out in her mind like that though. Don't even like say ""You're probably weirded out"" n6) I would write ""I just wanted you to know"" n7) Like someone else said, cut it off a ""you know how to contact me. ""nnThe note in it's original form is the reason I would recommend thinking twice before sending it. It's nearly impossible to actually predict what kind of response this could evoke. It's one thing writing this to someone who already understands your situation but if she's totally ignorant of it then it's a totally different thing. She could think of this note on a spectrum of Completely weird to Very Cute, or something like that. I guess you just gotta bank on the fact that she's a good person tbh. I know in the past when I've done this sort of thing it would be a fairly long note that would either be read, or not, and I would never talk to the person again lol. Just depends on how understanding and compassionate the person is. And in my experience it's pretty difficult to find someone with these traits. ",0

If I were you I'd look up a campus counsellor and go have a chat with them, what you're experiencing is much more common in college than you think and they'll know how to deal with it.

Even if you switch to something else later, or you don't ""click"" with the group, that's just one step closer to finding what you *do* like. Failure is a teacher, not an enemy. Keep trying new things whenever you can. nnAnd above all, remember you're not perfect. And that's ok. You're going to make mistakes, meet people you don't like, and sometimes waste your time. Just do your best. And that means taking time for yourself too, not just running from one event to another. nnOne step at a time. You'll get there. Believe that. ",1

If you have size 10 feet and consistently wear a pair of size 9 shoes because they look really flashy but are hard to walk in and stress you considerably, it's going to be hard to wear that pair of shoes every day, let alone start wearing size 9 shoes exclusively. Certain parts of our personality are probably set in stone thanks to genetics and while our life experience can certainly alter the course, they cannot reverse it. nnThere's no saying that pair of shoes may eventually stretch out and become more comfortable, easier to squeeze into. You may figure out a different way to land your feet when you walk so it's easier, less painful, more natural. But your feet will never shrink to accommodate the shoe. It'll be the shoe that expands to accommodate you. nnForgive the hackneyed analogy, but I can't think of a better way for this feeling.

You can be a real lone-wolf who doesn't want to participate in the trappings of normal socialization; just remember the crossing line is when you directly offend other people by being asocial, e.g. be too blunt like saying ""no, I don't want to do x because I dislike that sort of thing"" when asked or stuff like that.nnI think people respect someone who totally owns their own lifestyle though. If you act calm or cool when around other people even if you don't really participate a lot in social activities, people will probably think ""hey, this guy has some balls!""nnI think a big problem with SA is that people often misunderstand the SA traits (lack of eyecontact, or avoidance, no-man) as if people are just being dicks. It takes me a lot of confidence to ask if another person wants to go somewhere with me, and similarly it takes confidence for others to do the same to me/you, and when others reject my attempt to socialize I'm offended, naturally, but just remember the same applies to the situation reversed.nnGetting out of social anxiety means owning that you're not social but trying to be cool with it and not offending other people or it means reciprocating the standards we expect from other people, and becoming less self-absorbed in our thinking.nnThere are numerous ways to get out of the negative SA mindset, but it has to be done actively somehow, and you need some proper self-awareness.

My brain was wired in a way where it had to be busy all the time.nnAnd so when my work was done at school, I would hand it in and wait for further instructions. And since I was faster than the most of the rest, I had a lot of free time. So, since my brain had to stay busy, I started playing with my pen sometimes. And sometimes it was just some fun I had using my fingers to play drums on the side of my legs (which wasnt making any sound since I tried to be discreet). nnBut at some point, in 2nd grade, the teacher started noticing those little things I did. And once, I dropped a pen on the floor. And she gave me shit in front of the whole class. She made me stand in the corner of the class, facing the wall while the other students finished their work, and sent me to the school's kindergarten the next day for the whole day, where I sat on a chair the whole day doing nothing at all.nnnAfter that event, she called my mother ans asked her to meet her at school.

Now I'm only 20, but I know what it feels like to feel completely hopeless.nnI've been in therapy for nearly 11 years now. I was taken to mental institutes, put on medication, talked through the same stuff again and again, same old same old. Nothing ever worked for me, eventually it came to the point where I just gave up and the only reason I showed up to appointments was because I had to. I didn't believe it would help.nnI'm still pretty much at that place. Not a whole lot has changed since then. I still have panic attacks even thinking about meeting people. On some days I can't even get myself to use public transport or even leave my house.. sometimes not even my room (I still live with my parents).nnBut the one thing that changed was my mindset. I now believe I can learn how to manage and control it, and the more I try, the better it actually works out. I strongly believe that one day I can get rid of this entirely.nnThis is what I was trying to convey with my original post - It's important to get in a ""do it"" mentality and fail over and over so you can reap the benefits over time. It is damn hard, but it's going to get you much further than getting stuck thinking nothing you do makes a difference. The only problem about this approach is.. you need to actually convince yourself that this approach is worth following even when you keep experiencing failure and leave every social situation thinking you made yourself look like a fucking idiot. It won't work if you don't believe in it.nnFor example, I kept telling myself ""This is the way to do it, this will help, I can do this."" Did I believe in that? Hell no, I was painfully aware of the fact I was lying to myself. But I kept saying it, almost every day. It took me 2 years until I worked up the courage to even try public transport again. I drove two stations with the bus in total, and when I got home the first thing I did was breaking down and crying, all this pressure on you is insane.nnIn contrast, I went out with people for the first time in years yesterday. To a club. And those people were strangers! It only took me 3 years from the bus incident to get to where I am now, and I will keep pushing on, harder and harder. I feel like it's a lot like working out a muscle. If you never use your (social) muscle, it gets weak and even lifting an empty glass can be the most difficult task ever - But if you keep at it and train it, eventually you can lift that Glass with ease. But you can't stop there and have to keep practicing, because that muscle very quickly becomes very weak again.nnSorry for that wall of text, it's just a topic I'm really passionate about.

77,"tinewashere","comment","","My therapist has recommended visualising scenarios where I imagine myself acing a social situation while I do relaxation techniques. This can help you be more relaxed when you actually are in the situation. So you might be doing yourself a favour with fantasising - you just need to believe it, relax while you're thinking about it and slowly build up the courage to do stuff.",1
78,"tinewashere","comment","","I think the difference between the visualisation my therapist recommended and the fantasising mentioned is in the name - fantasising implies that it's fantasy, that it cannot be real - that the person thinking those things do no believe in the reality of them. Instead, visualising sounds realistic and would be closer to reality simply because of how one relates to the scenarios.nnObsessively wanting or dreaming for things that seem obtainable is not healthy. You are not living in the moment and appreciating the world for what it is right now, even with pain and anxiety. It could also stand in the way of any improvement and become a form of escapism. Some people indulge in books, tv-shows or video games because they want the life of the people they read about or see on the screen. Fantasising isn't much more different that that. And yes, that is obviously unhealthy. But I think that if you change your relationship to the fantasising - take out the fantastical elements - then it's not necessarily bad. It can be motivating, and you can use it to build courage self-esteem.nn&gt;  i always end up thinking about extreme unrealistic situations where i'm the most charismatic guy, getting all the girls and stuff like thatnnSo according to you, this is fantasy and ""extremely unrealistic"". What about just being the guy that goes to a bar and talks to a nice girl and has a nice time? The main goal is still intact - to gain female attention and be more confident - but without the fantastical elements. If you're performing relaxation techniques whilst thinking about it, it also becomes less anxiety inducing to consider doing in the future. The line of fantasy and realism can sometimes be blurred, but it doesn't have to be a bad thing. We might end up building up courage for things we would never had done before. As long as one has a realistic approach and doesn't use fantasy simply as escapism, I think it could be beneficial. Humanistic psychology, for example, is all about constantly believing we can better ourselves. Wanting to believe one can be better, maybe even slight unrealistically at times, isn't a bad thing, as long as one doesn't see oneself as too inferior to become what we want. nnThis is, of course, purely anecdotal.

Either way, I agree with the person that suggested seeing a psychiatrist first. While it did make a difference to talk to a counselor, it would have been much easier for me had I been prescribed something to take a bit of the anxiety away first. I found myself being too afraid to do the things my counselor suggested I do and wasted a lot of time pretending that I was actually doing the exposure therapy.nnFirst I went to the doctor and asked her to refer me to a psychiatrist/counselor. She said that she didn't know anyone and that I was on my own. So that was kind of a bummer because going to talk to the doctor about it was difficult enough! I ended up spending a couple months looking up a bunch of counselors online and found a lady that looked really nice. Her office was just a 5 minute walk from my house and, as I also have driving anxiety, it was perfect. I called her, told her I preferred using email and we arranged the first appointment that way. The first appointment was basically her getting to know me. How old are you? What do you do? What's your family situation like? She also made me fill out a form to determine whether or not I was suicidal or depressed...I actually think I am depressed, but none of the questions on the form applied to my symptoms. But anyway. After a few sessions I was more comfortable telling her things.

This is probably what frustrates your girlfriend. She can both see, hear and understand you're not very happy inside and she's gonna feel powerless about it if you deny the possibility of doing anything about it.nnOf course you could probably adjust as well, but like you say, you don't socialize or even like to because you want to avoid discomfort and the moments that bring fear of humiliation/judgement with them, but the problem is that this is not something most people want to adjust to. Since you're being with her you're both part of each others' lives and she's gonna feel a responsibility for the problem too.nnTrust me, treatment in the form of Cognitive Behvaioral Therapy can be a big help. It'll help you feel less controlled in anxiety-provoking occasions and get you out of the self-damaging mindset you have.

111,"velvet_owl","comment","","I've been taking propanolol for anxiety (mostly social anxiety) since I was nine and I'm now 24. I don't take it daily but always carry it around in my bag and take it when I feel particularly anxious or have an event that I find difficult such as a presentation, a dinner out or a meeting. On the plus side it helps me with my main physical symptom of anxiety which is shaking. Even the 10mg that I take stops my hands shaking excessively and so other people don't realise how nervous I am. When I take it I feel like my heart is beating really slowly - but this can be a good thing in anxious situations as normally my heart would be beating stupidly fast! The negative side is that it can make you feel a tiny bit dizzy, but I have low blood pressure so I think this might not be true for everyone. The dizzyness is just a bit of a headrush and not a big deal for me.  Although it deals with the physical side of anxiety it doesn't do anything for the mental side so don't expect to feel any different, you'll just control the outer signs of anxiety. Obviously CBT and therapy can help with the internal side and have worked well for me when combined with propanolol. Hope that helps a bit! :) ",1

It a situation that is the cause of a decline in mental health, especially in young men. And unfortunately because of society's continued toxic attitude to young men rendered vulnerable by such illness and the circumstances it creates one gets caught in a cycle of despair. nnI don't want to leave you on a down note though. I suggest you stick it out with you current girlfriend for now if she is content with the situation and focus on what you appreciate about her. I wouldn't take some of the quite nasty things that have been said on this feed to heart. Then I would say look into therapy, for reasons already mentioned by other posters. Have an exercise regime, u/ordekcuku was contructive in explaining how that could work.

113,"countsunny","comment","","&gt; So it's not okay for me to be condescending, but it's okay for you to guilt-trip people? Also, why are you pretending that I'm the only one throwing around insults here? Stop pretending like you're the innocent victim here and, like I already said, own up to your own behavior.nnDid not I just get through telling you I'm willing to discuss this on a mature level? Owning up to my behavior? I'm allowed to have my opinions and perspectives, regardless of whether you agree with them. Again, don't try to belittle or demean me for my opinions. I think you would find it a lot more fruitful to take the discussion to a mature level and convince the other person to entertain your perspective. This ""own up to your own behavior"" and ""stop pretending like you're the innocent victim"" is fairly redundant and not productive to this conversation at all. I'm trying to be mature and respectful toward you and try to convey my opinion so you can understand. If you're not willing to have that same respect for me then I suggest we end this discussion here. nn&gt;So, understand now why I think you're being incredibly short-sighted by expecting medication and therapy to work for everyone?nnWhere are you getting these ideas from? Must I quote what I said for you to understand that this is not what I'm saying. He wanted advice I gave him a starting place. I told him to look around, research medications, therapy. I literally said to look around this subreddit because a lot of people write their 'reviews' and responses to both. Did I say, ""Take some xanax and you'll be fine?"" No I told him to look up some treatments. Medication and therapy do work for some people with a combination of other things. All I'm telling him is to do his research. You haven't had a good response to medication or therapy. So what I recommend for him is to look at not only yours but others perspectives as well and come to a self-consensus on the route he wants to take. nnThis whole guilt-tripping thing is being blown out of proportion. My attempt is not to make him feel guilty or feel any sort of self hatred. OP if I made you feel that way I apologize. What I want to instill in OP is the importance to take back control over your life. Overcoming social anxiety is about overcoming where he is at right now and going to where he wants to be.

No one is guilt tripping, playing the victim isn't going to help anyone overcome anything in life. Sometimes you need to take responsibility and move forward. Of course anxiety is hard to overcome no where did I even say that.

I am also an extremely insecure person, and I have a lot of self-doubt and I always put myself down. I have a boyfriend, and even though he's a loveliest guy I've ever known - I'm still insecure. You've got to realise that the insecurity is all fuelled from the anxiety itself, it's causing you to think your not good enough, and making you feel the way you feel. Once you've acknowledged those negative thoughts and feelings, you can realise they aren't real and try to shift them. Also, does your boyfriend know your suffering from anxiety and depression? Or does anyone else? Because, even though it's really good you've posted on here and your going to see a psychiatrist, it's very good to talk to someone in person, because they'll be more understanding than you might think :) in terms of your boyfriend, he might just be a friendly person but at the end of the day he's your boyfriend - he's not with your friend, they might have things in common but that doesn't matter because he's with you.nnRemember, you shouldn't be worried about not being cool or not being good enough - these are just assumptions being made from the anxiety, you don't have any actual evidence that proves they think that :) these are negative thoughts and beliefs stemming from the anxiety. I'm not a doctor or anything, and I really hope this didn't come across as patronizing because honestly - I feel the exact same thing on a daily basis and it feels so difficult, but trust me - your a very strong and capable person, and you have many good qualities, so you have no reason to worry. nnGood luck, and I hope your okay! :) ",0

For me it's like being drunk minus the dizziness, nausea and/or vomiting (for lightweights like me who get drunk off 3 beers), and lack of self control. And the hangover is basically just crashing for 12 hours the next day.nnWhen I was in college and I didn't have a car I would pull all-nighters regularly just for this purpose. I mean I'd literally just decide that tonight was a good night to not sleep, usually based on something going on tomorrow. I noticed once I made it past the 20 hour mark and especially past 24 my anxiety would just vanish. In college one of my biggest fears was eating (alone) at the dining hall for reasons I won't list as I'm sure you all get it. Every day I'd either get food to go and eat alone in my dorm (single room) or wait until late right before they closed when it was practically empty except for a few stragglers, studious Asians doing homework while eating, and fellow social recluses. Sort of like going to a hole-in-the-wall dive bar at 1am and drinking in solitude surrounded by alcoholics instead of a popular bar with loud music at 9pm full of people partying and trying to hook up. But in a sleep deprived state? Fuck it, I'm going to a bar full of people. I just want a drink. I don't care about anything else.

I saw that the book was about improv and art and assumed it was about acting and painting and shit which I had no interest in, so I left it on my bookshelf at home when I went off to college and forgot about it until a few weeks ago when I visited home for Thanksgiving. Probably because I'm struggling with writer's block, or possibly because I felt bad about never giving it a chance, or maybe even because deep down I knew it would help me combat my ever-worsening SA and depression, I brought it back with me and began reading it.nnHoly shit. I can't exactly describe the book with words, but it's like psychotherapy. On a literal level, it's about how to clear your mind and change your thought process, based on how you view the universe in relation to yourself, to attain this enlightened, zen-like state of oneness with your surroundings and yourself, which clears all the bullshit from your mind and lets new ideas--previously locked away in your subconscious--flow continuously into your consciousness, allowing you to harness them for whatever your task is (aka: improvisation). The author uses music/dance/art/writing etc. as literal examples of artistic mediums but explains how the mindset required to truly create these things in the moment is one which we should strive to attain through practice and live with at every moment, without fear or judgment of the world of which we are a dynamic part. It's all about becoming aware and being able to draw wisdom and logic from the connection between the Self and your surroundings, through which you can find peace, happiness, perpetual clear-headedness, and channel 100% of your conscious and subconscious energy, working in symbiosis, into what you want, and how to cease giving a fuck about everything else. Fight Club philosophy told through examples of famous artists throughout history.nn**TL;DR [Free Play](http://www.amazon.com/Free-Play-Improvisation-Life-Art/dp/0874776317), a book about chilling the fuck out  and effectively going full-Buddhist to achieve every single one of your goals with clarity of mind**",0

In high school it was basically a no go, I was a complete mess. At university I studied Graphic Design and the course structure involved everyone getting an initial brief, creating a design and then pitching it to the class as if they were your clients. That was about 2-3 times a month every month for first 2 years of the course! D: I never ever wanted to do it but my tutor was right when he said it's something that we all needed to learn in order to make it in our chosen field. Sometimes I would do really well, I was confident, relaxed and everything flowed nicely. Other times it would all go off the rails from the moment I opened my mouth. There was almost no way to tell how it go unfortunately for me.nnBut I will say that the absolute WORST feeling in a group scenario is waiting your turn. There's no better way to build up anxiety than watching your turn slowly creep closer and closer until it's right next to you whilst you sit there helpless like something out of a horror movie. If you get the chance I would strongly recommend going first and getting it over with. Don't give your SA the chance to play on your mind. The next best thing is probably going last but only because by that point everyone's usually stopped paying attention, haha. But hey I did get through every single presentation somehow and overall I would say it did help with my public speaking but I'm still not great at it even though it's now part of my actual job.

161,"linkenski","comment","","I've found out that I hate myself not based on what I consider to be appropriate standards for people to have. Inevitably I look at what most other people are like when I see them, and compare myself to that. Caring about what other people think affects it too, but that's a negative thing to believe in, so that you gotta unlearn.nnOn the other hand, I think the reason I have low self-esteem and hate myself is not because of what other people say or think though, but rather, I'm disrespecting myself by not living life to my fullest. Somewhere in my head I have a higher standard for myself than I can meet currently, and it irritates me and frustrates me. It's like my inner passion is yelling at my executive passivity: ""JUST DO IT!"" like it's Shia LaBeouf. I want to do more than I do, but I just don't do it because primal instincts keep from doing it and otherwise sometimes when I do it, it keeps me from enjoying to do it.nn-------------------------------------nn**Here's some trivia btw:**nnThe following is crucial to understanding your own anxiety: When you have social anxiety or anxiety as a disorder in any way, it's not just a psychological complexity, it's physical too. Inside your brain there's a section called the amygdala. It processes fear and serves as one of your primal instincts. With anxiety you have habitualized fear into the muscle memory for certain contexts. Even though habits of fear is usually normal (you need fear to avoid danger, it's a survival mechanism) when you have associated the wrong things with fear, your fear triggers whenever these things occur just as it would if you spotted something genuinely (or normally) dangerous. When you experience fear, it's located somewhere in the back of your head. You should notice that the backside of your neck tends to tense up when you're in fear. You probably don't notice it now that fear has become so common, but you actually have train your brain to avoid responding with fear in the wrong situations to get over anxiety.nnThere's one excersise that can be done regardless of place and you should try to do it and feel the back of your neck loosen up a bit as you do it. Breathing excercises: You count to 10 in your head, breathe in slowly through your nose right from your stomach and after counting to 10, you breathe out with your mouth open for another 10 minutes and closing your eyes will help the effect. Do it for 2 minutes and you should feel more relaxed. You can even do this in situations where other people see you (without closing the eyes) and it'll give you a little boost and avoid anxiety going overboard. You're actually training your muscle memory to avoid anxiety in the situations where you do this. Just remember that muscle memory, as with every situation is habitual and needs to be trained frequently to remain changed. It's like when I learned to play guitar. It felt impossible and unnatural at first, but eventually my muscle memory gave way and my fingers naturally started to place themselves correctly without much effort and everything felt easier and more natural. nnSomething I learned from my own therapist.",1

I have a cousin who's also very people-shy and in the same situation right now (she just lives in the other side of the country).nnI know if you need treatment for Social Anxiety you can go to a doctor and be referenced to a psychologist who will then take what is called ""cognitive behavioral therapy"" sessions with you. It's sessions where you learn to get out of your head more and turn your negative thinking into positive thinking -- you relay your problems to the psychologist and they help you to deal with them. I did it for a month and it was a huge relief for me, but it was way too expensive (had to pay the equivalent of 25£ per session)",1
163,"Velast","comment","","No, observing the observer is what happens when you have that running monologue in your head that's narrating all those thoughts and sensations you're experiencing. You have a thought, then you comment on that thought, then you counter it, reason it, whatever. CBT does something vaguely like that from what I know, but you're more trying to logically reason those thoughts away. I could be wrong with that though because I never took CBT, only mindfulness and exposure therapy.nnnnWhen I say ""observe"" I meant more like letting ""x"" sensation or ""y"" thought just exist without fighting against it or focusing on it in any way.

He explains it himself pretty clearly I'm the video: If you feel anxiety, then just let that be there and don't try to fight it *or* get wrapped up in it. Because if you start worrying about your anxiety, you're just adding another source of stress to yourself. You fall into a kind of a feedback loop. ""Oh my god all these people are making me freak out and I'm starting to sweat. Oh fuck people are going to notice, I must look like a complete freak. I need to calm down calm down calm down FUCK IT'S NOT WORKING FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. That girl is staring at me, god dammit I'm sweating more and she sees it and she's going to tell all of her friends about the autistic fuckwad at the party who did nothing but sweat and sit in the corner like a moron."" Cue panic attack.nnnnA mindful approach would be something more like simply observing what's happening inside of you. Not thinking about it, not stressing about whether or not people notice. You'd pretty much just have the thought ""I'm starting to sweat"", and then you would leave it at that. This way, you would have an easier time not thinking about yourself and instead work towards accomplishing whatever goal you're trying to accomplish. Mindfulness and exposure therapy go hand in hand.

One, you gradually overcome all your fears and become the person you WANT to be, as you said, but two--you become depressed and then suicidal. I know because this is where I am now. I've always been a very ambitious individual with hopes and dreams, especially in regards to my career, but in the past couple of months I've fallen into a downward spiral of depression. I *have* lost all hope. I have none. I honestly think I'm gonna die before I reach the age of 25. There's just no way a person like me can survive. Everything I do is detrimental to either my physical or my mental health. I've accepted that I'm always going to be in this awkward, uncomfortable and confusing position of WANTING a certain kind of life, wanting to be so much more, to experience certain things, while also being unable to take any kind of action to achieve these things out of anxiety and fear, which, sadly, has been hardwired into my brain since birth. I'm not suicidal right now, but I have been before, and if I don't end up dying of some untreated illness or in some kind of accident in the next few years I think the most probable outcome is that I'll become legitimately suicidal and kill myself. By losing all hope, you are free from the fear of death, and free to take your own life.nnThis is why losing ALL hope is bad. You even saynn&gt;Don't just be that person, want to be that person.nnSo in that case, if you want to be this person, you still have some hope left.

You will go nowhere for the rest of your life and you will die in the exact same spot you're in now.nnINSTEAD...accept who you are now, lose all your optimism and pessimism and become a realist, take a look at the person you WANT to be, and completely ignore everything else.

I know she's your mother but that doesn't change who you are and she can't change who you are. She isn't a psychologist.nnI started cutting people left and right when my SA got worse and worse. Be careful not to cut caring people who want to help but just don't understand. Leave those that think their way of living is better than yours in the past. The first step to managing SA is accepting who you are. Not everyone needs to be the social butterfly center of attention, despite what people believe. nnIf she says something like that, just brush it off. You know who you are and how you want to behave and how much you want to socialize. Work towards that, not what she wants you to be like.nnAnd in a year or two you can move out and it won't matter how she thinks you should act. ",0

Look unless you can barely function then yes medication might be for you. I highly recommend not going on medication. They just literally mask your symptoms. At least for me once i thought i was cured and life was all good i got off the meds then a month later i got hit hard with anxiety and depression and quit my job. Been off them for awhile now. It feels great to not have those annoying side effects. CBT is the way to go, try group therapy if youre serious about getting better i did for 3 weeks it helped a lot then quit because i didnt think anyone understood SA that well lol, doing something youre passionate about, being a more loving person (hugging your parents, animals, etc) just contributing to society in any positive way possible. Talking to strangers, smiling at strangers, going out NO MATTER how you feel. NO porn try it. Good luck. I just got off the greatest week of my confidence in awhile without the help of meds and i just recently went through a break up hahaha now im feeling in my head and kinda just disconnected from my environment its a process man never give up. Oh sheesh almost forgot try MEDITATION i dont care how hard it is DO IT try 5 min at first for like a week then 10 trust me it will change your life if you take it seriously it has helped me and its only been 1 week!

It reminds me when fat people complain about being fat but at the same time are actively losing weight and someone comes and says this shit. Like just because we are trying, doesn't mean we can't complain about our current state. Holding that shit in isn't good for you. Let the person ""whine."" Also you probably don't know their specific situation seeing as how you don't know this person and are making a judgement based on a short 5 sentence paragraph. This is why there are therapists, to actually listen and learn about someone, because a therapist has to get to know the individual to be able to help them. Therapists would go out of business if all they did was say ""stop whining and get out there and fix your problem"" (hence why you're not a therapist and should probably stop giving advice).",0

It's really not that long. I know it seems like it now, but just remember that someday (soon) you'll look back and realize how long ago high school actually was and how it feels like ancient history, but also how it feels like you were literally just there. High school was a living hell for me and I was also in my sophomore year when I was diagnosed with SAD. At the time it felt like it just dragged on and on, but now, only 5 years later (which feels more like maybe 2 years to me), it's like it didn't even matter, and it's just an unpleasant memory. I'm still the same person I was then, but I'm much, much different. 16 year-old me would not recognize 21 year-old me and I feel bad for 16 year-old me because he couldn't see how young and ignorant he was, taking everything way too seriously and filtering his thoughts and actions 24/7. Now that I've had time to find out more about who I really am and reflect on the past, I've realized that my whole life has basically been a lie. I've always changed for others and projected myself through a filter to the world around me. I've never, ever been 100% honest with anyone, not even myself. nnI briefly attended college (just for a year) and it was so much worse than high school for me that I couldn't handle it and I dropped out. My first Reddit post was [this plea for help](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qqipz/im_failing_college_and_i_dont_care/) and at the time I felt like I'd ruined my future and any chance of being successful or happy, that's how bad I felt. It was so bad that I didn't even bother to write it all out, because I'd been going over the same rant in my head and was exhausted from even thinking about it. But now, only 2 years later? Literally none of that fucking matters. Nightmares are terrifying when you're in them because you don't realize you're in them, and maybe you still feel kind of shaken when you wake up, but once you start the day you forget all about it. That's what high school and college feel like to me now. They were horrible dreams, but I'm awake now.

Do I have stockholm syndrome or what?).nnShe would ask me to seek a psychologist and get help when I told her I had problems and then when I said the same to her once she just denies it and refuses to do anything, so she's no better herself.nnI can hear myself as I say that though, and the best solution is to just get some distance from that toxic relationship and I have moved away, so I'm basically just figuring shit out and trying to recover from a full childhood and my entire life so far of (arguably) mental abuse unless I'm totally mistaken about the whole thing.",0
227,"TfwScreechingCheeses","comment","","I know it's bad when I felt anxious just imagining myself doing those exercises while alone :') They seem like they are helpful though. I already visualize myself speaking to people anyways, almost all the time as a way to cope. nnCBT is actually what I wanted as I did a very small amount of work with it before and it helped so much at the time, and apparently this is what the current therapist is supposed to help me with, but instead he just tells me that I need to stop labeling myself with my disorders and then I will be fine. nnIt's gotten to the point where I can tell myself ""Why are you anxious? There is no reason to be, it's just people and you're safe, even if you say something dumb, they won't remember it."" but I'm still anxious and I have no idea why.nnWhat kind of script would I use for the slow talk?

231,"linkenski","comment","","Wow, you really are far down a rabbit hole of various drugs aren't you? I have little experience with people who are into that, but I would certianly advise you to cut down on it whenever you get the chance to say ""No"" -- not to whoever supplies you with it or whoever helps you; say no to yourself and the drugs.nnDon't take drugs that aren't prescribed after proper diagnosis. You can take vitamins and herbal meds and stuff that are totally benign, but from what I read you started out somewhere and then went further and further down getting really fixated on needing some kind of med to inject to yourself to make you feel better.nnIf you can ever overcome using so many things remember you can feel better without them and there are healthy alternatives to getting the boost or kick drugs can give you, like good excercise and other activities.nnDefinitely don't give up, but try to hold on to yourself and take every moment of self-control you have to say ""I'm not doing the drugs this time"" and slowly cut down on it. I have zero experience with addiction so this is the most honest reply I can give you.nnI'm 100% sure there's alternative ways out of the pain of SAD other than drug abuse and if you simply remember to mentalize yourself sometimes and try to cut down on the lies to your therapist and take the advice you may be given to heart during therapy, you can definitely turn around, I believe. :)",0

But I feel like you are using distance to coat over your anxiety. By that I mean you are telling yourself that these people won't be an impact on your life so don't worry about whether or not they like you (Which you brain is going to automatically assume they don't -&gt; SA). The best mentality I think to have is, ""This is an opportunity to meet an amazing person"" or ""This is an opportunity to make an awesome relationship."" It has to come with positivity not negativity like ""They won't remember me."" I think if you approach interaction in the former mindset that would give you the most benefit in your struggle with SA. Each person you decide not to talk to is one less person that could possible be a long lasting friend, SO, etc. Have to take advantage of an opportunity of a lifetime within the lifetime of the opportunity. People will come and go if you let them. Good luck, I know you can get passed this!",0

If he/she is any good, she knows exactly how you feel. You don't have to worry about not knowing what to say. The doc will ask you what he/she needs to know. You will probably need to explain what areas exactly are making you most anxious, what you're doing to remedy this, what your goals are..so you could put some thought into it, but don't stress over it. Also what you could do is write out any questions you have right now so you wouldn't forget to ask them, because as it is a new experience you will be fully focused on the present and might forget that you even had questions.nnAlso don't be afraid of medication. You cannot be forced to take anything. You may get a prescription and it's 100% your choice whether you comply or don't.

If someone learns I have social anxiety and that it means I spend 24/7 at home doing nothing but slack or get through life on the most basic level and avoiding people whenever I'm not obligated to do anything else it's too much of a taboo to most people I think and they'll see me as a loser and sort me out of the list of people they want to know.nnIt doesn't help how terribly and crippingly awkward I am, which leads people to tell me how awkward I am (past experiences) and get mad at me for not being able to chill and ruining *their perfect social atmosphere*.nnGod, I'm so fucking pissed at almost everyone for having the leisure of being able to say ""You suck, fuck off because I have all I need!"" and not realize that I can't just go someplace else like they can because I have nothing.",1

My most recent job was at Starbucks...yeah, I had to interact with customers all day, and it went terribly. I literally just stopped going to work, because I was too afraid to tell the manager anything and say goodbye to everyone after I just got the job a couple of weeks before.

Because of this, I've also been getting terrible grades, am currently on academic probation, and I just feel super shitty about myself all the time.

253,"linkenski","comment","","I wish you luck. I really hope you'll write some entries about the progress, because there are people who could use your experience as a means to guide them as well. Personally I was at a psychiatrist for a more general reason and we swiped through all sorts of diagnoses like autism and adhd but I came out sort of empty handed, though I kept inferring that the big problem was my lack of being sociable and that the underlying reasons were things such as anxiety, concentration-problems and depressive thinking etc.nnThey reassured me when I got pills for ADD ""Remember, we don't want you to change as a person, but these can help you with the specific problems you have!"", and I think it's important to trust them, but if there is a first sign that you don't feel like yourself, if you start feeling numbed or alien somehow, that's when you back out. Depending on the diagnosis and medicin it can happen but it's never worse than that you can back out and say ""I'll figure out something else"".nnIt's not like you take a pill and boom you become a different person. The effect of a pill can change your behavior for the time being but as its effect wears out you go back to the previous state, but obviously, the longer you maintain the treatment and start perhaps being more outgoing and getting along with people better you do sort of change because of that, thanks to your treatment, but I say, be your own judge.

It is now refered to as ""Autism Spectrum Disorder"" -- a change that was made to more accurately reflect how Aspergers or just autism have varying degrees of severity. Many people in the past were diagnosed with ""mild Aspergers"" for example.nnI've gone back and forth about it. I have some terrible eye-contact anxiety/discomfort problems my whole life and I'm almost sure I at least have a hint of Aspergers. My father was obviously having autistic traits as well, which I even noticed as a a little kid because I would be confused by how he could look at you, and since growing up one of my sisters friends mentioned it too that he would make her feel confused, so I feel that reaffirms it.nnAlso, try looking up some videos on Youtube of people with Aspergers. Depending on how cogniscent you are of yourself you might see something of them in you or not.nnJust bear in mind that having Aspergers should not mean it's the end of the world for you. It means you have an obstacle others don't have, but with the right tools you can have a life that's every bit as fulfilling (to your own criteria) as other people, and there are psychiatrists, psychologists who specialize in autism that can help you figure out your problems (if you actually have it)",0

It would be dishonest and unfitting for me to give advice on something I don't know frak about.nnAll I know is, many authors of music, literature and etc. used their art as therapy. They would write songs or stories including their own struggles as a way to get their thoughts out of their head and find some way to address it.nnI used to be a huge fan of TOOL for example. Their lead singer responded one time when fans asked why their new stuff wasn't as angry or aggressive, that he used those early albums to get through where he was at the time and it didn't make sense for him to keep dabbling in that low and dark pit of anger when he doesn't feel it anymore.nnAnother example is Quentin Tarantino who wrote The Hateful Eight when he was ""kind of angry about certain things and maybe a little depressed"" he says in a video I saw on YouTube.nnSo I think the way you deal with something that happened in the past that bothers you a lot, like a bad childhood, you find ways to express it through some sort of craft. Maybe just jot down notes, describe your feelings, write the words down that keep appearing in your thoughts like ""why?"", ""why me?"", ""stupid mom"" or ""I hate you""nnAnd then suddenly your thoughts are not just in your head anymore and perhaps your view will start to slightly reshape itself when you look at these words and see when they are real.

I think the anxious thoughts we have when we're sober are going to surface when we smoke as well, but accepting that's going to happen and then diving deeper into what actually contributes to those anxious thoughts is suuuuper important. Which is why I refer to it as a tool. It might not be the ""fun"" high some people want, but for me, I massively appreciate the brutal self honesty that weed helps me accomplish. I'm able to focus on one thing until I really, and I mean really, understand it. Which to me, can be fun.

280,"TMA-3","comment","","No, I never felt addicted to it. I'm not sure if this is true of all SSRIs but I know sertraline, according to my psychiatrist, is non-addictive. I don't know what the proper scientific terms are, but it's not a ""per use"" drug, aka you don't take it whenever you feel like you need it; it takes 3-4 weeks for it to build up in your system and an equal amount of time for it to leave, if I recall correctly, so its effects are more subdued and long-term.nnYou're supposed to slowly wean off it instead of suddenly stopping, gradually decreasing the dosage, which I did over the course of almost 2 months. I honestly don't remember feeling anything, maybe some mild changes in sleeping patterns or something, but nothing major. After I'd actually stopped taking it altogether, it still somehow felt like it took the drug another four months for it to completely leave my system, so it was VERY gradual, and in a weird way it actually felt like it took an entire year, just because my anxiety starting getting worse again. It was like the exact reverse of the previous year when I started taking it, which slowly got better and better; the year I stopped taking it got worse and worse, and is still getting worse now.nnI did up the dosage about 6 months (from 50mg/day to 100), which my doctor said was normal because most people, while not becoming dependent on SSRIs, will still become adjusted to them, and will likely stop noticing the effects as strongly because they're accustomed to them. That's exactly how I felt, and going up to 100mg/day solved that. My doctor also explained that many people will choose to go stop taking them after a year, or a year and-a-half, because they feel like the drug has helped them sort of get their lives together enough that they can survive without it. Like it's taken them to a place in their lives where they're happy and content enough with the way things are going, with how they feel, and with themselves, that they can go the rest of the way alone now that they've gotten a little ""push"" from the meds to help make it over those first few speed bumps. That's also how I felt, exactly, and I was confident enough in myself and my willpower to try and keep it going on my own, mainly because I didn't want to have to rely on meds to live a good life, as I said before.

I take everything so personally (and having a good memory doesn't help) that I go over every tiny detail (most of which did not bother me in the slightest at the time) for weeks. I even write down 'planned responses' just so I don't forget, or that I change others' views about me around. It's pretty sad. It went from general note-making so as to remember tasks/plans, to a bit of an obsession. It stresses me out, especially being constantly reminded of these (as I save them as tabs) whenever I'm online (all day). Anyone else encountered something similar or am I full-blown crazy?",0

286,"NudaeVetatur","comment","","I feel so too. Someone gets around I automatically lower my voice. Or if someone is around I won't initiate a dialogue.nnFunny thing is, I remember my father once told me 9 or 10 years ago when we were going to school together and I was little, that I do this... I wish I had known I had social anxiety already back then. then they could have taken me to the psychologist and have work on it much sooner.",1
287,"dwild","comment","","I wouldn't suggest to always say yes. Do only what you think you can handle, one thing at a time. Prepare yourself mentally for each of them, keep reminding yourself to let go negative things and keep only the positive one.nnIt's not a magic trick either. Living theses experiences bring 2 things, first it give you opportunity to gain social skills, because of our social anxiety we are really late in our social skill development and the only way to get develop them is to experience it. The second thing it bring is positive experience. That positive experience should be your motivation. You want more of it. You know the time you told a good joke, well if you did it once you will be able to do it again, or the time you met someone and said hello first, more success!nn&gt;I have a lot more ammo against myself and reasons to inwardly cringe because of embarrassing things I've said or done on these occasions.nnYeah that's an issue. What bad happened to you since then? You did embarrassing things, sure, but we all do, but how does it affect you? Have you lost some friends because of theses embarrassing things? Did you hurt someone? I'm pretty sure the only way it did affect you is how you see it yourself and nothing else.nnWhy do you cringe? Ask yourself that question when it happens. Did people react badly? How does it affect you? Can you live with that? Do it affect your relation with them? Ask them if you really think it does. I remember once I was coming back with a friend, I didn't said much, she was handling all the conversation, I was avoiding her eye, etc... later I apologized for that on Facebook (it's way easier for my anxiety) and she literally said she didn't noticed that at all. Hearing it really helped my confidence, if she didn't noticed that, she probably doesn't notice most of what I notice about myself.nnI assure you, the bad tough are still there but I'm became way better to deal with them and they are far less present than they were in the past. I didn't noticed it at first but reading stuff here made me realize how bad I was in the past by reading similar experience I had in the past.nn&gt; And I feel bad that what is said to be the only solution isn't working and maybe I'm just irreparably defective.nnThis is not the only solution. Therapist exist to guide you and give you ways for you to do the same, there's medications too to help. I assure you, you aren't irreparably defective, as long as you are alive and want to improve, you can do it!",0

If the only problem is talking to your coworkers your just a freshman in college and you got a while till you will actually be a physical therapist, so maybe start working on it now so when you are one you can be more talkative with your coworkers.

290,"dwild","comment","","So much good information from there!nnThe most important thing that you need to decide at first, do you want to change? This is the most important thing. For a long time I was happy alone and seriously even if I could go back in time, I wouldn't change that, at most I will just introduce the idea of a possibility to change. I was perfectly happy and I don't consider that part of my life that negative. There's nothing wrong with being alone, as long as you are happy with it.nnIf you want to change, then you can read my comment, otherwise, continue on your life. Also, anything that I will write here will be related to my own experience and how I personally felt, I don't know if it apply to you but it did to me.nnIf you want to change, you need to know is that it will be hard, it will take times (a lot of it), it will be so slow that you won't even see yourself change that much (but believe me, you will) and you will need to persevere even though you will doubt yourself and feel like crap some time.nnYou also need to be less negative about yourself, you are not hopeless and you are not worthless. You do have negative trait though, everyone does, but learn to be more optimistic about it. There's some stuff that you will be able to change, like your uninteresting life, and others that you won't be able to change but fix a little bit or at least learn to accept them.nnLet's start pour uninteresting life, why stop you from having one? What interest you and how can you do more of it? I really liked movies, so I started to go regularly, once a week most of the time, often more. I really like SciFi so I started to read more of it, I also started to go to convention, often in cities far away. I was interested in climbing, I did it, same for hiking (though I would really like to do more but transport is an issue, I'm working on that). Find more hobbies and try them!nn&gt; Therapists never helped as I have trouble opening up to people and it always seemed like I don't really have enough of a problem or mental disorder as other people do.nnYou just identified a problem, fix that! That's the kind of thing that I'm talking about. We all have issues that stop us from doing what we want. Now if you want to do them, fix theses issues. Again, it's not easy but you have to start by a first step. From there identify more and fix more. You have trouble opening up to peoples, why? Are you afraid they will judge you? How does some people do it then? Can you make sure they won't judge you? A therapist is there to help you, not judge you, he has seen far worst than you believe me, but the only way you can believe that is by trying yourself, push yourself to open up to him.nnI still have huge trouble to open up to people, I have been working on my social anxiety for the past 3 years probably (to being able to open up to people probably for the past 10 months I would say). I do push myself constantly to try to do it more. Little by little I succeed.nnAnother thing, stop lying. They know you lie, that will make them feel uncomfortable with you, they won't act ""genuinely"" with you like you would in real life. If you don't feel comfortable talking about something, just say that. If they push you, keep telling them you prefer not to. At one point you will need to open up though, but do everything at your own pace.nnI never done RP so I can't really give any advice about that. Any social thing is great though so keep doing it. Even though you may lose theses friends, keep doing it, you will meet other great people and make more friends. If you like RP, what about LARP or DND in real life? In my city there's a pub where you can play board games and every week they host a DND game. Look in your city if you have something similar. If you are too afraid to go, find out what stop you and then try to find ways to get around that issue or to fix it. Are you afraid that they will judge you? Contact the GM privately by email, tell him your story (don't have to go in as much detail as you did here but just tell him you enjoy RP but does suffer from social anxiety and you may be a little too shy) and ask if it's an issue, he may have some advice or maybe even able to convince you everything will be alright (which probably will, more players is always good and even if you don't do much it's better than nothing). I met some of my best friends at that pub I was talking about. They host weekly werewolf games and I started to go regularly nearly 2 years ago. At first I stayed in my corner, not saying much, mostly observing, but little by little I started to talk, to take more place, and even though I'm usually not outgoing, I am in theses events because I developed some confidence there.nntl;dr: Find why you are like this and fix it little by little. Try new hobbies and push yourself out of your comfort zone but at your own pace. ",1

I think I saw it as just a slutty stage but it really wasn't just that. I hurt a lot of people.nnMy former therapist suggested that that tendency might be because I struggle to find some successful social connection, and it's easiest to get that through people who are trying to hook up or get a girlfriend.

She came to my first session and my therapist educated her on SA and how it is a very real disorder.nnSo you are not a loser. You are misunderstood by your mom and it is your job to try and fully explain it to her, get some research if you can. If she can't accept the fact that you have a mental disorder then I'm afraid you may have to stop interacting with her as much as you can, because it is unhealthy to be told you are a loser and that something is wrong with you when you have a fixable mental disorder. nnHaving social anxiety doesn't make you a loser man.

Especially because social anxiety is a circle of death, a circle that doesn't _allow_ any miracle to happen, to save you from it. We are alone with our anxiety, so we're alone at the start of the fight as well. But the first step is to step out of that loneliness for just a moment. Tell someone. Anyone. Tell them you need their help. If you can't seem to talk to your family, that's _okay_ in my opinion. Then you should contact your doctor (in my country you need to go to your doctor first and then you can talk to a psychiatrist) directly. I know how that sounds, ""easier said than done"". It took me time too, lol. But try it.nnI'm with you. And I think I can speak for everyone in this sub: We're with you, because we feel/felt the same. I'm just a small step ""ahead of you"" right now, and that's good because i was able to tell you what i did. I hope you can do the same. Or at least get inspired. If you ever feel too down, remember how great life could be. That's what i always do. And i now believe that i can some day be whoever the fuck i want to be! nnEdit: Forgot to mention how severe my anxiety is as well. I just graduated and now i have nothing to do, no job or anything. I have only one ""friend"", which i now never see and rarely text with. He doesn't get me and we're very different. nI can't really go on a bus either and i'm to afraid to start driving lessons. I don't know how to get to most places in town and easily get lost. I can't be my real, true self around others. I blush when i talk to strangers.",1

Anyway, maybe i will mention this to my therapist.

But the main thing that made me doubt were 2 apprenticeships, working experiencea. during those works I was very anxious to the point i wasn't able to function. I liked it, and at the end i was able to pass, but I always remind the negative aspects and start to doubt myself (like ""if i'm anxious i can't do this job!""). I go to therapy, it's a service offered by my university (I started two months ago) and it really helped my SA, but everytime I talked about my insecurities for my future, my therapist said that every student have this, and it's normal.

334,"nextqc","comment","","At first, I read and thought ""This guys doesn't seem to have social anxiety, it seems more like he's simply a jerk"". Then you mentionned different behaviors like talking on the phone, going to crowded areas, typing messages, which could be natural reactions from SA.nnOn the other hand, those SA behaviors and some of the others you mentionned could be associated to introversion. For instance, the way he just retreats at various moments and goes radio silent might mean he needs time alone to deal with his emotions and his social exhaustion.nnBut overall, it only seems he's not respecting you. I probably don't know every detail, but from what I got right there, it most likely doesn't have anything to do with SA.nnUsually, people with SA tend to have a more passive reaction to stuff. If he retreated, just like you said, he would instead be sad or affraid instead of mad when you show up. I've never heard of a single person affected with SA who would get mad at someone else for something that happenned after taking some time off, unless that person had really good reasons for it. (I feel like this line I just wrote doesn't properly reflect what I mean, but its hard to explain and I'm not sure how else to explain it).nnOverall, I can only determine, by the info you just gave, that it doesn't seem to have anything to do with SA. And for what is worth, the BJ thing, you deserve and apology. No good guy, even when affected by SA or introversion, would actually used their phone during sexual acts for any reason. He was in the wrong, and you shouldn't be feeling bad, or confused because of his actions. It simply seems like he doesn't respect you, and takes you for granted. In my opinion, you deserve better.nnDon't beat yourself too hard. If you gave every relevant information as to why he might be mad, I don't see any reason why he should be taking things that badly. You shouldn't get confused or panicked over this as you're not in the wrong.nnEDIT: This is mostly speculation as I know people deal with SA and inteoversion differently. I only answered considering all the info I know about SA, inteoversion, and what you mentionned about your relationship proplems.",0

I couldn't talk properly, I was more able to dance or stand in a crowd without feeling anxious but not to start meaningful conversations and I didn't like it. Not for me. Plus the next morning I felt terrible. Then I started therapy (cbt) without medications (my therapist can't prescribe them) and it had a huge effect on me. I'm still anxious but not so much. I care less about what others will think of me. But at first you have to work hard, and stay motivated (for example during exposure exercises). My anxiety is still here... I think the main goal is to decrease it, but it won't go away forever. I still have the tendency to be anxious. But I'm learning to control my anxious thoughts. ",1
337,"HandMeABeer","comment","","Thanks for the response! My parents were very authoritarian in nature and used the ""we're the bosses and you do as I say"" parenting philosophy. If I tried to talk with them about something that was upseting me, they would just lash out at me instead of having a discussion. I couldn't have an opinion or my feelings over different things were generally ignored (for a perspective of what I had to deal with, these were parents who would accuse me of being gay because I couldn't get a girlfriend or would throw things across the room if they were 'stressed' on that particular day). Not surprisingly, their rather unorthodox parenting style has been a subject of discussion at many of my therapy sessions.nnYeah, my therapist has been helpful if I need someone to talk to but in terms of long term improvement I haven't seen any. She has been effective at unrooting some rather traumatic emotional events in my childhood but knowing isn't the entire battle for me. I'm going to talk to her about alternative options like cognitive behavior therapy or social anxiety group therapy sessions the next time I meet with her. Aside from a therapist change, do you have other suggestions for ways I may be able to cope with my world views? Questions I should be answering for myself, other resources?nn",1

341,"RapistLeopard","comment","","Yes.nnI've never seen a therapist because I never wanted to expend on it, but since I know I have SA (4 years ago or so), I started working on it with CBT and talking about this with a friend.nnIt surely was a slow method, but it worked! 3 years ago I couldn't even look at someone at the eyes or go to a party with lots of people, but now I'm able mostly thanks to CBT and ""going for it no matter what"". I started to go for these situations without thinking about anxiety and yeah, sometimes it felt terrible, but if you can manage to understand it's all in your head, you will get used to. The most important thing for me was to go step by step.nnFor example, going to the supermarket by myself was anxious for me, but not as much as going to a party. So I started working on that first by just doing it and CBT and eventually it worked! And I'm not talking about a day or two, this process took me months for each step, but if I look up now at how that made me feel so anxious I find it really stupid.nnOf course I still have SA and I get anxious about some things, but I've improved a lot and probably now I have just mild anxiety, so I can surely tell you that it works.nnIf you try hard to get over it and do CBT correctly, I'm sure you will get better so I hope you do :)nnCheers.",0
342,"SAPunk","comment","","Your parent's social lives and how they treated your social life certainly has an impact on social anxiety. That's why it's one of the first things that every psychiatrist and therapist will ask you. Neither of my parents really had friends as I was growing up. My Mom would talk to my friend's moms, but they never really socialized without us. My Dad just never had any friends that I knew, he fell out with his group before my parents had kids. As a result, I feel like I never really understood how to socialize with people outside of school. My parents didn't usually go to social events or gatherings, so I kind of assumed that was normal. nnI still find it strange when I talk to people whose parents had active social lives, frequently drank alcohol, went to bars, parties, and other places where kids couldn't go, etc. ",0

356,"AmatureProgrammer","comment","","That sucks. I had something similar happen to me. nI never really had a group of friends due to my social anxiety. I would try hard to make friends, but I never really seemed to connect with anyone. It wasn't until my freshman year in high school where I met my first ""long term friend"". I'll call him X.nnX was a really toxic person. He was everything I hated in people. He was rude, arrogant and really disrespectful. To make a long story short, I never really liked this guy, but the only reason I put up with him was mainly because I didn't want to be alone. Through him, I got to meet other people and it somewhat broaden my ""temporary"" friendship circle. After graduation, we went to the same college, but he ended up dropped out his second year. He was never college material anyway. I stopped talking to him after he had a pretty nasty breakup with his ex girlfriend of 5 months. He treated her like crap, and even after the breakup, he was still harassing her and even tried to get her back with witchcraft. None of that worked and his ex girlfriend father threatened to press charges on him if he didn't leave her alone. nnAnyways, I no longer talk to him, and right now, I currently don't even have a single friend.

I am actively working on my anxiety everyday.  I've gone on a few dates, went to the bars alone just to meet people, try to make myself talk to 3 strangers everyday.  Its not easy, and everyday is still a struggle. But I am seeing progress, i can see a light at the end of the tunnel.  When i see people complaining on this sub, i get it but at the same time, its frustrating to listen too.  Because the answer is to go fix the problem, and its going to suck, but it gets better. I actually have a date planned  tomorrow with an unbelievably attractive girl i met on tinder. I am terrified, shes at least a 9.5, Im probably a 7. No idea why she would want to go out with me, but Im going to do it.  If i am a stumbing idiot who turns red all the time and she leaves so be it, I am done letting fear dictate my actions. nnHere are the things that have helped me so far.  nn1. Reading The Feeling Good Handbook by David Burns - Its CBT, and it helps.  It make you realize how ludicrous some of your thoughts are that are causing you so much anxiety. For me in particular its fortune telling, i constantly assume the worst will happen and it creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. Which would lead to me avoiding things. Now I am not avoiding, i am just dealing with it.  If i experience anxiety so be it.nn2. Stoic Philosophy - this actually has lots of tie ins with CBT that I have noticed.  One of the core beliefs is that you shouldn't spend time thinking about things you have no control over. For example worrying about what other people think of you.  What value does this provide to you? None, all you can control are your thoughts and your actions.  You try and act in the manner you believe to be appropriate.  Someone else can perceive you in whatever way they choose to, you can control it, so why think about it at all?nn3. Exposure therapy - i try to challenge myself in someway everyday.  I've been trying to talk with 3 strangers everyday. Usually this is brief like asking someone at a store where to find and item.  Or i've even tried using Omegle and just chatting with the video on.  I also recently came across a list of challenges, basically putting yourself in awkward situations and forcing yourself to deal with it (one of them was asking a pharmacist for condoms, and when she brings them ask if this is the smallest size they have lolol) i have not worked my way up to that, but the thought of being able to do something hilarious like that and walk away unaffected is motivating to me. nnWow. I kinda went on a rampage in this comment. Hope maybe this is helpful to someone here. ",0
371,"forzasports1990","comment","","I know exactly how you feel. I have always been skinny and could never gain weight. However, I decided last year that I was going to get out of my comfort zone and hit the gym. Hitting the gym is not only hard for SA people, any skinny guy feels insecure in gym with your typical big tough guys. However, with small steps, I was able to feel at home at the gym while being that skinny guy.nnYou need to start small. I was lucky enough to be able to go with a friend at first. He wasn't really into the lifting culture, we actually had to go once per week to the gym in addition to our school's gym class. We had to go to the school's gym, so it was very nerve racking to work out in front of people that I see everyday. However, my gym class was called ""Back to fitness"", so the first time I stepped in the school gym it was with my class. We were given a great tour and explained how every machine works. We were also given routine examples and a list of exercises recommended. nnI was really afraid of other's opinions, so I always wore jogging pants and long sleeved shirts, so that they wouldn't see my tiny arms, but the thing is that I did go to the gym. At first, I would just do a lot of running(40 minutes) and then go to the free weights for 10 minutes, as I was afraid of doing exercises wrong. nnWhen the school year ended(2 months ago), I wasn't packed with huge muscles. I only went to the gym for 3 months 2 times per week and didn't have a real routine nor appropriate nutrition and wasn't trying very hard. However, I realized that I had a lot of time ahead of me in the summer and that I had to turn my life around. I was fucking tired of having SA(which also gave me depression) so I decided to hit the gym outside of school. But where was I going to go? There are about 15 gym for me to chose, which one was it going to be? nnI decided to go with the equivalent of Planet Fitness where I live. Why? Because the customers are known to either be poor or old. I knew that I was going to feel safe working out in front of older people. But before making my decision, I went scouting the area every day, at different times to see when it was the least busy. That happened to be 10PM, 1 hour before it closed. I spent about 2 weeks doing research on exercises and a good routine before feeling confident enough to actually go. nnHere we are, 2 weeks later at 10PM. I am sitting outside this place to go buy my membership. As I pay, I notice that the gym is empty. I have all my stuff on me, but I still can't go. I have no idea what I stopping me, but I was just too afraid. I just go back in my car and go home. The next day, I decided that I had to go. So there I go back in my car at the same time and get changed in the gym. I only pulled a cardio workout and scouted the area to see where everything was. After that, I went back home and did a lot of research to understand every machine. nnIt's now been a month since my first time at that gym. No, I didn't notice any changes in my body, but my mind has changed a lot. You have no idea how good I feel in the gym. I get a few nods everytime I walk in. I am still scrawny, but I am not afraid to ask this big guy if he is done with the squat rack. It also cure my depression. I am finally motivated to do everything that I wanted. I wake up happy and motivated.nnNow that I got my story out of the way, I want to give you some tips and advice. Yes, you may feel motivated by my story, but chances are that you will pussy out like me the first time you go, but that's fine! You need to fail here. You need to congratulate yourself for all the small steps you will make. You need to celebrate your first workout and see this as an achievement. Anyways, here goes my tips:nnn* Do some researchnnYes, you need to know what you are doing. Having SA means that you afraid of looking like you are lost. Going to the gym will be a new experience and you will be lost if you don't have a plan of exercises. Bodybuilding.com has helped me a lot.nn* Know what to expectnnYou need to know that everyone will think that you are skinny. They will acknowledge that you are skinny and new to the gym, but that's great! That means that they are expecting you to be lost and using low weights.

You can just walk in the gym, do one set and leave. Just go. It doesn't matter what you do and how long you stay just as long as you actually do something.nnnnFor anymore help concerning bodybuilding itself, I suggest you look at a lot of videos. They will teach you how to and what to lift. I am only a dude with SA lifting, I am not qualified to teach you how to lift.nnDo not give up. Physical activity gives powers, I mean it. You will feel so good after a session at the gym. You will have energy and be willing to better yourself. Good luck in your journey and feel free to PM me if you need more motivation or tips, I am here to help!nnOh and BTW, don't listen to the people commenting to quit the gym. Do not fucking give up. Do not listen to people telling you to accept SA. With the mood improvement and self confidence the gym will bring, you will see SA slowly fade away. ",0

Or maybe you do have SA indeed. One thing is for sure, you will have an answer if you talk to your doctor. We tend to exaggerate our problems and we tend to be influenced by what we read on the internet. nnHowever, you do have a lot of symptoms people with SA have, so you could possibly have SA. But to be sure, I'd talk to my doctor. nnLastly, you seem to be uncomfortable in your current state. Whether you are just shy or have SA, I would suggest talking to a professional about it.

The only social interaction I get is at work, only when I need to talk to someone about something work related. Even that is hard. As for medication I take sertraline (which a lot of people say doesn't work for them, but works decently for me), never taken Xanax, ask your doctor about that. Will it always be this way? I hope not. Only way to fight it is stare it down and fight it, although a lot easier said than done. We can all talk our selfs up in the mirror but when it comes down to it, do we still go through with it or back down? It will seem impossible when the time comes, often I feel like puking before social situations. Did I improve when I fight it though? Yes! ",1
376,"dwild","comment","","Something that work for me is to expose myself to my anxiety. Even though I'm starting to become anxious, I keep doing it. The trick is to not go over a threshold. If I'm too anxious, it affect how I act and then everything goes bad (not that bad but my anxiety amplify everything that goes bad and then I keep thinking about it and it just worse).nnTaking a walk is a great way, you can start in a residential place with less people and then move on to place with more and more. Going to movie theaters, fast-food, restaurants, conventions, also helped me. All situations where I had just a little anxiety but that let me see how people acts and let me understands them a little better.nnAnother thing that you need to do, is stopping to be negative about yourself. You don't seems to be that negative, though you do say ""anyone who bothers to read this"" which seems like it's negative reading your thread (it doesn't bother us, we are there to read theses threads, like any other one), but it's important that you are aware that you should avoid negative though. Often we justify being negative by saying that this way you are aware of your flaw, which is better than not. Sadly often we are wrong, theses negatives though aren't that important and they are amazing to lose any motivation to improve. Instead, you need to find the positive in the situation and if really there's something negative important, don't see it as negative but as something to improve. nn&gt; at this point i have no assurances and putting my faith in a psychologist only to go thru months and years of no improvement would probably destroy me.nnIt doesn't destroy you right now? Really how trying anything is worst than not trying anything and staying the mess you are right now? Believe me, you can't be worst than you are right now, you can fail, and you may fail often, but that will just bring you back to where you are right now. Anxiety is a bitch though and it will always try to give you the impression you don't improve and are just worst than you ever was by simply trying. You need to stay positive. nnTherapist know what you live, they know plenty of ways of dealing with it, they are the professional, they know what they are doing. I never saw one because I'm sure I can fix that by myself, I hate depending on someone, but I have no doubt that I would be able to do it much quicker than currently with their help. I already convinced myself to go see one if I no longer see improvement.",0
377,"ISillyWilly","comment","","I think this is basically the mentality that I'm trying to reach in therapy right now. For me it's also helpful (although not necessarily healthy) to believe that the worst will happen, but if something else happens, then that's awesome. I sort of insulate my mind from the anxiety by allowing myself to feel judged by everyone and accept that as fact, and then move on and be ok with it. Basically my anxiety stems from the ""what if"" factor of people's judgement, and if I can be certain of being judged, then it's not so much of an issue. I'm trying to reach the point that I go into things with a neutral mindset like you're describing and just seeing how it goes. Good post man. ",1

389,"alpacalicious","comment","","We discussed this only three days ago. We never talked so deeply about that, because before we focused on my anxiety, on having coping skills to decrease SA. Now, three days ago we (me and my therapist) but mostly I, came to the conclusion that my SA is caused by my fear of being left \ rejected by others. The fake image is connected with that, because my belief is that if I show others this image, they will like me and not leave me. And anxiety is there because I'm constantly afraid mostly of rejection. nnWe ended the session at this point, but my therapist didn't tell me solutions for this. I think in the next session maybe. I think if I resolve the fear of being left, and rejected, maybe I will act more spontaneosuly, whitout the fake image. But I dont know how to decrease this fear. nnOne thing that helped  me is to find the other person interesting. In the past I noticed that when I was in social situations, and I was really interested in the conversation, in sharing with others, and I found myself connected with others, my fear decreased. nnSo maybe try to show entushiasm in sharing and interest in the conversation, but I know it's not that simple. But maybe you can enter a social situation with the thought of ""everyone here could teach me something, can give me something"" even if you don't like the people or the topic...but it's true, you can learn from everyone, and I really think with this you can feel connected a little bit with others. For me it works! ",1
390,"alpacalicious","comment","","Maybe during social situations you always try to be fun, or to behave like this\that, but by doing this you lack spontaneity. This thing happen with me too. During social situations I feel like I'm not myself, because it's my SA that limits my expression, I tend to create an image of me, of an appropriate person, I give this image social qualities (like being fun, or gentle with others)...and I'm like this to an extent, but it's like I create this image that is super positive and perfect, which is impossible. And I fidn myself acting like a robot, someone who is ""programmed""! And I don't feel spontaneous at all. So, I think this is similar to your situation...you go to social meetings with the thoughts of being fun, or you maybe want to have an image thst others can accept\like. But maybe you arent like this. Like in my example, my ""fake"" social image is that of a nice, gentle person, someone who never fights with others, or who always agree with others etc...and this image remains static with others,  I always behave like this, even if it's not my nature. I'm an impatient person too, I can get angry easily, or I can be more sarcastic...but I can't show these traits to people, because my anxiety tells me ""no, if you behave like this, if you show irritation, even a small amount,  others won't like you, they will think you are impolite!"". But that's not true, because after a while I have the impression others don't like me. Maybe because I become too fake with that image of me! Because I found that people like spontaneity, and like someone that is honest, and that is able to show various traits. nnMaybe you can discuss this with a therapist, try to find the root of this. I talked with my therapist about this (the fake image thing) recently, and I was able to identify one of the possible roots. ",1

The fog gradually clears as the meds enter your system and you just sort of stop caring about everything, which paves the way for unhindered, unbiased decision making; simple, mundane tasks that would normally be nerve-wracking suddenly seem easy and trivial. It's like a tremendous weight has been lifted off of your shoulders--you're still carrying some of it, but most of it is being carried by the SSRIs now. Everything is lighter and simpler.nnI was on Sertraline for a year but I ultimately decided to go off it because I wanted to try combating SA on my own; at the time, I was in a place where I felt confident enough in myself to continue on without meds, because my life had been turned around and I was actually happy; it was like the meds helped me get partway up the mountain, and now I was strong enough and brave enough to climb the rest of it alone. Unfortunately, over the next few weeks, as the drugs left my system, I felt the weight of anxiety slowly return and place itself on my shoulders again, getting heavier and heavier and heavier until it was unbearable and morphed into 24/7 depression, neurosis, and self-hatred.

Discover what you like and who you are.nnFrom there, start working on your social skills, use your hobbies to do it with peoples, but do it for the activity, not the people. You need to forget when you fail and concentrate on the positive things.  If it goes bad, who care, you enjoy that activity alone already and at least you tried. If it goes well, then you found someone to share an activity you like and more often than not, they will like similar activities than yours. Slowly build friendship from there. nnMy activity was to go to a local pub where we can play board games, in fact today it's been exactly 2 years I started to go there. Every week there is a werewolf game with a big group. It took me about a year before really feeling comfortable around them and starting to add them on Facebook. It then took months before we started to do things in group and months again before I was able to do activity 1 on 1 with them. It was never easy and believe me I doubted myself plenty of time, it's get easier though with time.nnStart small and don't expect any big improvement. It will take you a long time before being able to see that you improve but you will be. You need to push your anxiety, but don't do it too far. There's something that you want to do but your anxiety block you, try to do it, if you fail, see why and try to do it again. For example, I had to buy a shirt once, my anxiety was really hard, but I was still able to go to the shopping mall. I didn't do it but at least I did go out, it's a positive. The next day I went again and then I was able to. Both were big steps though but you can see the idea. You only fail when you stop trying.nnDon't forget there's therapist for that you, they can help you and there's medication that may make it way easier for you if it seems really too hard for you.nnI have no doubt you can do it by yourself.

420,"universe93","comment","","I totally understand but the harsh truth is one day, you have to face it in order for your SA to get better. This is the stuff a good therapist is meant to help you out with, working up to that point, often with exposure therapy, and helping you get there. If just being around people without talking to them cured SA, a lot of us wouldn't have it. I'm 27 and I have the same fear but I've managed to reach the point where I can do it sometimes without so much anxiety that it cripples me. I almost quit therapy when my therapist told me that if I keep doing the same stuff nothing will ever change, but unfortunately that horrible lady was right",1
421,"universe93","comment","","I don't want to accept it! Tha's my main barrier. I don't want to sit with anxiety, I don't want to accept it, I want it to go the fuck away. I want strategies to make it go away so I don't have to experience it in the first place. Like I have never ever thought ""it is actually not that bad, I would allow this to go on forever"" about my anxiety in 27 years of life - the longer I sit with anxiety the more likely I am to have a panic attack. I wasn't interested in stuff like mindfully brushing my teeth every morning, which was something my therapist literally suggested I do. I get the feeling my therapy group might have explained mindfulness really badly, but I don't see it as the absolute cure some people say it is. I got much more mileage out of CBT myself.nnI will ask though, what exactly is the different between being mindful of anxiety and distracting yourself? Because the ""focus on your five senses"" stuff was banged into my head repeatedly by my therapy group as something to do when you are anxious so you become more mindful of your surroundings and not be so inwardly focused. Again, never worked for me.",1

Not people with small change. nnWhat you experienced was a really common of symptom of social anxiety where you were guessing the cashier's thoughts and thinking inwardly instead of being 'in the moment'. And that's very treatable. A lot of therapists use mindfulness for it, others use CBT stuff, but it is DEFINITELY treatable. In the meantime, go and walk into that store. Nothing will happen. People won't stare. You'll just be another customer the cashier won't even remember. We don't go home thinking about the customer with the loose change.

Girls especially will not care (unless they're a jerk, in which case you don't want to date them anyway). Girls have SO MANY hangups about their skin. I'm a girl and I spent most of my teen years stressing about my acne and practicing makeup to hide it. I didn't notice ANYONE else's skin but my own.  Chances are the 16 year old girls around you are far more worried about their skin to stress about anyone else's. nnAnd by the way, boys can wear makeup.

Of course meeting someone you hate or who bullies you etc. might make you feel like this, but it shouldn't happen with people you have no reason to be afraid to walk into. nnAlso it's probably often the case that people only have anxiety with certain people or in certain situations, maybe moods even, i dunno. nnThe question you should ask yourself is whether you can live your life without big problems, is your social life okay?

That's why it feels impossible for anyone else to understand it. Truth is, in therapy you kinda have to pretend as if you're not seeing what you see and play with different perspectives.

453,"TMA-3","comment","","My doctor told me when I started taking it that a lot of people who go on SSRIs only end up taking them for a year or a year and-a-half, basically just long enough for it to get their lives on track and point them in the right direction. I didn't really expect this at the time but it's exactly what ended up happening with me. I was on 50mg/day for about 4 months, then the effects started to wear off as I became adjusted so my dosage was increased to 100mg. I did that for another 8 months. By the time I'd been on them almost a year, I felt like I didn't need them anymore.nnI'm not sure what the scientific term is, but SSRIs aren't a ""per use"" drug, they're more long term. It takes a few weeks for them to build up in your system before they take effect, so after you've gotten used to their effect, it kind of becomes invisible, you know? Like at a certain point, you can no longer distinguish between the effects of the meds and your own thoughts; for me, at the end of that year, it wasn't ""I'm content with my life right now and I feel so much better because of these meds,"" it was just ""I'm content with my life right now and I feel so much better."" I was so much more confident and hopeful in the future, and in my own abilities, that I kind of forgot that wasn't the true me, or at least the normal me. I didn't want to have to rely on meds to live a fulfilling life, and I felt confident enough in myself that I could handle any returning anxiety on my own going forward--or that I was at least willing to try--so I said ""that's it, medication held my hand and walked my partway up the mountain, but now I'm ready to tackle the rest of it myself."" nnI guess it was sort of like being intoxicated. Once you start drinking, your inhibitions dissolve away, and you gradually stop giving a shit about things that normally worry you. You're able to actively interact with people and everything is awesome and you don't care because you're as light as a feather. You're much more confident now and you rejoice when you realize that you are, in fact, capable of being non-anxious and socializing with people normally. Everything's fun and great. Then once you sober up you're back to your old, disappointing regular self. I guess what I'm saying is I thought the feeling of being drunk would last even after the alcohol left my system, because I thought it was ME who was doing all those things, but I was wrong--it was the alcohol. (on a related note, you're not supposed to drink while on SSRIs).nnTL;DR I thought I'd won, but it was just the meds tricking me into thinking I'd won. nnnn",1
454,"TMA-3","comment","","This sounds like the other side of my experience with Tinder.nnI downloaded Tinder as a confidence booster (didn't work though lol, did quite the opposite) back in January and had one pretty meaningful super-like match with this girl. We talked casually for a while, and we shared a lot of the same interests so that made it easy to find things to talk about (she also had social anxiety, so that was a plus). Eventually I worked up the courage to suggest meeting up sometime for coffee or something if she was at all interested in meeting and talking for real. She seemed enthusiastic at first, but I, like you, was worried I would be a letdown in real life, and I kept reminding her how anxious I would be and how I was worried I'd be a disappointment. nnIn hindsight, I feel like saying these things actually made HER more anxious, because I sort of put her on a pedestal and treated her like she was perfect, based on my imagined perceptions of who she was and what she looked like based on her pictures, or who I wanted her to be. I see now that she was probably already as nervous as I was, that she was also worried she'd be a disappointment, and by voicing my insecurities with her, that just intensified the fear on her end because I built her up to be some sort of perfect dream woman. I was so intent on talking to her and getting to know her, so intent on making something happen between us--even just a platonic friendship--that I think her anxiety got out of control. That's probably why she stopped responding. I swear, this girl was a 1 in 1,000 match and I ruined it by a) complimenting her and b) disparaging myself. For example, after we agreed to meet in person sometime, I told her I'd like to wait a few weeks before doing so and talk to her more first, and that even then I'd be really nervous and shy in person because I'm really awkward around beautiful women. I thought she was a 10/10 and that I was a 4/10, and was so worried about MYSELF being a disappointment that I never stopped to consider that she might feel the same way.nnSeriously, this guy is probably nervous too. He's more focused on making a good impression on you than anything, because he's more than likely worried he'll be a disappointment somehow. He might have a false idea in his head of who you are, and he might be disappointed in you when he meets you, but if he is, then he's probably not worth your time anyway.

Sometimes what people with SA can benefit from is Exposure Therapy which in layman terms means ""face your fears"".

460,"CagedGarden","comment","","EDIT: I'm obviously not a therapist, I'm doing a copy paste of what I have been told by a real CBT Therapist on this subject. Just so we are clear.nnI will try to explain as best as I can what my therapist told me when I asked her a very similar question: All of them are. All the traits you listed are innate within you and to some extent are actually necessary for your survival. The problem kicks in when, due to whatever life cooked up for you, your brain will let one of those traits take over to protect ""you"" from being hurt. (You become avoidant because you don't want to be hurt by others, because you don't want to trust them, etc). That part will eventually become dominant and if not kept in check can lead to dysfunctional behavior and all of that pain and discomfort we are all familiar with. nWith that being said, Alcohol is not a Mr Hyde potion that will completely switch your personality from one to another, it simply eases up your stronger inhibitions therefore you will feel more comfortable doing things you'd usually steer clear from. It is known as a great ""socializing tool"" for that reason.nEDIT 2: As far as therapy goes I had no trouble whatsoever booking my appointments in the early afternoon with all of my therapist so it seems strange to me that you're having trouble with that.

However, I still had terrible self esteem and hated myself too. So what i've learned from just experience and from reading lot of shit about this is...nnn1. To LOVE yourself. This is really important because everyone needs to be able to love themselves and be happy alone bc life is not always going to give you good/close people to have. Also, gives you self esteem and confidence to approach people and flat out be yourself. Tell yourself your cool and the world is lucky to have a unique you. If your not cool and hate yourself, then don't lie to yourself to accept yourself. You need to change yourself for the better!nnn2. Meditation - allows you to be comfortable with yourself and thoughts and lets you calm down and really acknlowedge and be grateful for great things in life. Allows you to live in the moment. This is very important because the worrying about the past brings depression, while worrying about the future brings anxiety. So be present!nnn3. Excercise/workout - make you feel good about yourself and just in general. One of the best feelings to me is always after a nice work out I feel physically great and emotionally happy and i feel i have the energy to get out my comfort zone (talk to ppl)nnn4. Have a growth mindset- know you can change yourself slowly to be the sociable person you want to be. Every action you do doesn't define you as a person, but defines you in that moment. So yes if u do something awkward, u were awkward then, but that doesn't make you overall awkward.nnn5. Stop worrying and imagining - Worrying about the future is what causes anxiety. Yes, you have SA, but worrying about having SA and then worrying about an upcoming social situation makes it a lot worse. Just try not to worry about the upcoming social situation and you'll do better than you were going to do when worrying. Anxiety stems from false imagination that your going to fuck up and be awkward. You have to change that imagination to realize that you won't fuck up and even if u do its SO fine. You didn't die and if that person didn't like you then w/e bc they aren't important and don't know you NEARLY enough to really judge you. You just slipped up by accident.nnnnWow I wrote a lot.

Now that is not normal. I get like this before any social events too.

I can go to uni fine, I can have a presentation in front of a small group (anxious, but not too much), I can talk to people at work, I can go outside on the street without feeling anxious (only sometimes I do). nnSo I'm betting if they say you had SAD at the hospital, then you must have had it. If your current psychologist does not agree, ask why and correct her if she's wrong about something about you. Be ready to see why you don't have it any more...or explain why you think you have it, etc. And if it doesn't seem right to you, you can always make an appointment with some other psychologist.",0

497,"CagedGarden","comment","","&gt;""Just do, there is no trying.""  n~some green man in a very famous sci-fi franchise (The quote is wrong isn't it)nnThat's a pretty common mentality when dealing with anxiety and ""changing"" oneself. Your brain doesn't like changing because all the weird coping mechanisms and habits that it has formed up until now have been made to ""protect"" you. It sounds twisted, and it kinda is, but most of our dysfunctional habits actually come from a desperate attempt to alleviate our suffering.nBeing scared of changing is absolutely normal, being scared of not knowing what the next step is going to be is even more common.nHowever not recognizing the fact that you can improve in pretty much anything you do on a daily basis is a great disservice you are doing to yourself. Of course we are not gonna be perfect. Who is? For every good thing somebody does there is an equivalent amount of ""bad"". Why do even need to be perfect? Why not just try to improve what you really don't like about yourself one step at a time and start working from there? nnSpeaking from my own personal experience I can tell you that a black or white vision is the absolute worst. Like ""if I can't be perfect then it's no good"", then I realized I had no idea what perfect is because everybody has a different scale of perfection. That fucked me up real bad because I never knew when I did enough so I kept trying harder and harder until I couldn't handle it anymore. It still wasn't enough, I would still feel bad about it.nUntil one day during therapy I realized I could do what I felt was right. It sounds stupid when you put it into words but the feeling of ""I can do this and then if I need to rest the following day it's still gonna be ok"" is the best thing you can learn on forgiving yourself and realizing you work on yourself to feel better and improve, not to place on some non specified, subjective scale. nGood Luck.",1
498,"billtothelil","comment","","I know exactly how you feel. I'm 17, I'm suppose to graduate this year. But I'm not in school. I've been to therapy and been on many medications. It didn't help much. I'm currently not going to therapy and not on medication. I totally get the FaceTime thing. My boyfriend will want to FaceTime and I just can't do it. And it comes off as not caring or wanting to talk to him. Which isn't the case. My family understands to an extent. I'm sure here soon they'll start asking me what I'm going to do with my life. I honestly don't know the answer. I know how it feels to think life is set up for me to fail. Sometimes I just feel like I don't belong cause I make myself believe I can't do normal things that everyone does. I haven't really been dealing with my anxiety for the past year, since I haven't been doing much of anything. But the only way I know how to deal with it is just telling myself encouraging things. Which sounds so dumb when I think about it. But it helps me sometimes. It helps more when other people tell me encouraging things, even if I have to tell them to tell me those things. Also, when I do something that I wouldn't normally do like calling to order a pizza or asking someone in a store for help, I get so proud of myself. It's the best feeling in the world to do something and it not go terribly wrong like you think it will. I remember times like that when I'm proud. Cause if I can do it once, I can do it again. So I try to convince myself to do things cause I know at the end when I finally do it, I'll be proud of myself. I'll feel like I've accomplished something. Another things is just telling yourself fuck what other people think. Easier said than done. But if you keep telling yourself that, maybe instead of saying it youll feel that way. Fuck what other people say or think about you. Put your happiness first instead of thinking of ways people will judge you. nI'm still trying to overcome social anxiety, so I do these things all the time. It helps me some.

The only reason people think you're ""goody-goody"" is because you are. You can't take other people jokes at your expense, wear dorky clothes, and live a straight-edge lifestyle, and assume people will think you're any different than the person you're clearly acting as. People can tell you're not acting like a innocent guy, you are one.

When you see that tough wife beater guy in the liquor store you assume he's tough because of his demeanor, and you likely would be right. Women assume you're innocent because you act, look, and communicate that way and they would be right.nnIf you want to be treated as normal or cool, be normal or cool. Start by respecting yourself more. Don't let you co-workers give you shit. Do some gossiping of your own if provoked. And try to talk to women more in general.

What if a person needs me?.."". I think you can try to find something that keeps you alive. Try to improve something and if you try everything and nothing works, you can say ""ok I surrender"" but first try. Maybe go to see a therapist.. I started  therapy months ago it was my first time. I was suicidal, at first I didn't bring this topic, instead we focused on my social anxiety which is the cause of my problems. I found that by talking to my therapist, I was starting to feel more hope, and I didn't feel suicidal. I reached out to a therapist because I was afraid. Again, it was my survival instinct.

You don't have to block the shakes, because your body needs to do it. nnI shake sometimes when I'm in social situations, and I have really high anxiety. Or when I constantly fear I will being judged, so I shake a lot during oral exams, when I had to talk in front of the class at University, or in front of a group, and even when I go to therapy (when I talk I shake too). nnYou have to treat it like a reaction of your body and let it pass. On that article I mentioned before (it was named shake it off or something like that) the author suggests that when you are shaking for anxiety, you could find a place where you can be alone for a moment (a bathroom, your car, etc) and exaggerate the shakes. I tried this before therapy, I don't know if it really works, but it's better to let go. I think if you focus too much on this symptom, you become more anxious because you may think ""everyone will notice and they will laugh"", and you start shaking more. So it's better to focus on something else, to keep yourself distracted or busy (maybe focus on sounds, on what you see, on details,try to count in your mind or to do mathematics operations, they really helped me to distract from the anxiety).

Two weeks ago it happened to me, I met two friends from university, I was't prepared because I saw them in the street all of a sudden, and maybe this triggered my anxiety.

This is called depersonalization, when you can see yourself doing things but you arent really there mentally (or you can have episodes of leaving your body etc). nnAnd then there's derealization, this state happened very often, it started when  I was 16-17.

I hate going to school sometimes because I look around And think about all the amazing opportunities I've hAd these past few years to meet great professors, get good jobs or research assistant opportunities, make great memories with new friends, etc., but instead I wasted it all because I prefer sitting at home alone to avoid the anxiety.

I'm not going to tell you whether or not you have SA, because only a licensed psychiatrist/psychologist can give you that diagnosis, but I think that unless it's creating severe complications in your life (e.g. losing a job, failing relationships, dropping out of school, etc.), you're probably not suffering from clinical SA.

I used to have one when I was 12 with a girl, back when I wasn't socially anxious, but then we argued for something stupid and since then I can say that I never had another friendship like that. nnI think we have to try and go out with different people, maybe you dont feel a connection with one, but maybe if you try and hang out, you can found someone. I read an article one day where they talked about this topic. They said that to have a connection you have to talk about something deep, like emotions. For example, in a conversation two people can talk about their different jobs. The conversation can quickly reach an end because if the two have different jobs (doctor and farmer) they wont be interested in knowing the details. Like, a basic conversation can goes like ""Oh you are a doctor, nice."" ""Yes, and you?"" ""I'm a farmer, I plant potatoes"" ""Oh, that's nice"".  Then maybe the conversation will stop.nnBut then, some of them can say something like ""Sometimes I feel that I have to strive for perfection in my job, and I feel uneasy because I feel I'm not competent enough"". This is a personal information, and an experience that most people can understand because they have experienced it at some point in their lives. Then the other person can say ""Oh, me too! I always feel Im not competent and maybe I should change my job!"". nnSo by talking of something deep, like your emotions, maybe you can bring the conversation to a different level.nnAdditionally, do you think it is possible to be happy without friends or have I just conjured up in my head that I need them? ---&gt; I really don't know. Because society tells us that we have to be in a relation to be happy and to have a meaningful life. So it can be something that is enforced by society, people think ""I have to find someone"" because otherwise they feel they don't fit in society. If we would live in the wild maybe we would seek others not to be happy but to survive. I think that happiness can be found in oneself, you don't have to seek others to be happy. You can be happy with others, but if you aren't happy or satisfied with yourself in the first place, you won't feel ok with others. There will always be a time when we will be alone, by ourselves. If you are not happy with yourself, you'll feel lonely because you think only others can lift you up, when in fact it's not true. You can be alone and feel perfectly happy, calm and peaceful. So it's important to spend time alone too, only with this you can know yourself. ",0

612,"universe93","comment","","""They were perfectly nice people and they laughed at some of my jokes and they might've liked me""nnThat is what you need to focus on. That. Not the rest of it, that. Every time you think something negative, challenge yourself to find a positive as well. The biggest thing is they actually INVITED you for an interview. That means you were a candidate for the job. They looked at your application and liked you enough to consider you seriously for the role. That's a HUGE deal. Millions of people WITHOUT SA apply for jobs and never get interviews, and you got one. And not only did you get one but you were able to go and crack jokes and be social. And you survived. Congratulate yourself for that!! Every time you go to a job interview you get better.nnProbably the best thing to do to stop the spiraling thoughts is therapy. I get that some people can't do therapy until they have a job but if it's at all possible go see one now as they can really help with tactics and ideas to stop the negative thoughts.nnEdit: I will also say that while benzodiazepines like Xanaz work for some people, they're suuuper physically addictive and don't even work for some. Benzos are usually used as sleeping pills, some people take one and just fall straight to sleep LOL. I can take half of one and all it does it make me have a nap haha",0
613,"alpacalicious","comment","","""According to him, I cannot change anything if don't know what the problem is"". That's not true! I did CBT with my therapist, and she asked me about my past. She said that yes, my past and some events that happened had contributed to my SA, but that her treatment wasn't about finding the main cause. She said there are many causes both genetical and social-personal. But you can treat anxiety even if you don't know the main cause! For example, I did a cbt exercise, called abc, I had to face my anxious thoughts...the causes of my anxiety wasn't involed in this, I remained focus on my present and on how I was feeling. nnI have the same problem with my therapist. I'm really anxious with her. I started therapy 8 months ago now (with my university). It's not that my therapist is bad, because she's really comprehensive, she respect me and my problems, she always tries to understand me, she validate me. So I don't have to feel that anxious. But I feel anxiety with her. I think that you can feel more anxious with certain people. For example I feel more anxious around young women, and feel less anxious with older women. But when you said that he seems to not understand you and your problems...maybe that's his attitude that makes you anxious. I think you should wait some sessions, and see how they go. You can also tell this to your therapist, ""I feel anxious around you"". I told mine, after many sessions, that I felt anxious with her, and we talked about this in a session. Maybe it can solve something. Also you give feedback to your therapist. But then if you don't feel safe in therapy even after many sessions, you can search for another. nnSome weeks ago my T suggested me to write a diary/journal, and so now I write my diary during the week, I'll write how I am feeling and my daily routine, what I did in a day, then I show it to my T.

I just had to make sure you were aware of what's going on."" and did it in a way that was very clearly mocking me.nnThe second after that I was like ""fuck him lol"" but then as always, the phrase just slowly kept repeating itself in my head over the weekend ""had to make sure you were aware of what's going on"" ad nauseum, and I started internalising. It happens every time I get critisized or ridiculed and it's been this way since forever. I have no idea how to stop it from happening and it just increased my anxiety so much that I haven't went since, and that's what happens.nnI need to be able to dare venture into anxiety-provoking spaces but I'm afraid it may eventually make me insane or something because every time I pick up on some new failure that I keep thinking about and I don't know how to fix it.nnThe point of criticism was my very coginitive skills basically... that's just something I have no idea how to change and that's my problem. I'm very, very vulnerable. I always go into situations fearing people will point out certain things and if they do it's like an affirmation that I suck ""as expected"" and I've developed this deeply toxic mindset for myself that just makes it impossible to enjoy anything together with people.nnI really wish I knew what to do. I've talked to my mom about my issues but she can't stand hear me babble about it and starts to cut me off and tune out. I went to a CBT therapist last year who insisted I should just ""forget the past and think more constructively about the present"" and that's true but I really want to know what to do about my previous thoughts that I can't seem to let go.nnEDIT: Sorry for the longer writeup. I didn't mean to frontload it to you to begin with, it just had to be said.",1
640,"chalkychalk","comment","","I went through the same thing a few days ago. If you live in the UK, it is best to seek CBT now so you can see a therapist in work hours as the waiting list to see a therapist outside of 9-5 hours is LONG (took me over a year). It's difficult but you need to get on your doctors case to get you into CBT asap, book a doctors appointment every week if you have to, until too they put you in the list. Make your symptoms appear as serve as you can too be seen faster.nnGetting a job will be difficult, but if you push through it, I have faith it is the best thing for you and your confidence. For me, having to face people everyday was hugely stressful but after having a (proper 9-5) job for  over 3 years now, my confidence is the highest it has ever has been in my life.",1

I need someone/something to hold my hand and walk me through the dark, because apparently I'm blind.nn2017 goals:nn1. Talk to a psychiatrist/psychologist/therapist/whateverist to finally confront my shit, including SA of course, depression, self-esteem/image issues, what's causing me to self-harm, and (possibly) unresolved childhood traumas. nn2. Go back on SSRIsnn3. Drink more. I know this is a very terrible solution that will most definitely turn me into an alcoholic, but I don't know if I can or want to stop. Even just a drink or two works wonders for me and turns night into day, not necessarily in regards to how I act but mainly how I feel. Not even at the point of being drunk, just ""mellowed out,"" just something to take the edge off (and it is a very sharp edge). The danger here is that once I start drinking, once I realize how good I feel, I just want more, I just figure ""if it makes me feel increasingly awesome, why not keep going?"" and it's amazing at first feeling completely at ease and confident and attractive like a normal person, but before I know it I'm on my knees in the bathroom at 4am throwing up in the toilet and waking up the next morning in my clothes with a headache and upset stomach feeling this horrible mix of guilt and shame and disappointment in myself, then I do it again a week later.

That's the good news though (as weird as that may sound). You can now identify your struggle and learn ways to combat it. Here are some major, major things I would recommend to you:nn- Look in to meditation and practice it every nightn- Begin an exercise routine and stick with it. The key is that you make sure to STICK with it.n- If you can afford it, set up an appointment with a psychologist so you can begin talking about your struggles with someone who's gone to school for these types of issues. I can not stress enough of how important this one is.n- Look into joining a  local CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) group. Just do a search in Google and something should hopefully be in your area. n- Check out the book ""How I Overcame Social Anxiety"" by Tobias Atkins. Not affiliated in any way, just a good read. nnnAlso, if you'd like, there's a video that explains SA really well and is actually the thing that made me realize that I had it. nnhttps://youtu.be/4truuD_xMP0nnGood luck man :)",0

658,"sadboy633","comment","","the idea behind exposure therapy is to start with things that give you minor anxiety and slowly work your way up. throwing yourself into a situation that gives you extreme anxiety is never a good idea. so, say talking to a cashier in a grocery store gives you level 2 anxiety on a scale of 10; this would be a good place to start. then, maybe next time, you purposely hand the cashier the wrong amount of money, or you take your time putting your change back in your wallet. once you can do these things without feeling anxious, you move onto something that gives you level 3 anxiety on a scale of 10",0

Then I got a text from the kid I sat next to,  asking where I had been(we would exchange homework occasionally).it helped me knowing at least one person there wasn't making fun of me. I almost failed the class,  since it was still so hard to go. It didn't get better,  but that was before I had started getting therapy and meds. All I can say is talk to someone about it. Feeling alone in your struggle(which let's be honest,  no one understands us unless they have it too) sucks,  so venting definitely helps.

837,"DangerTerritory","comment","","Oh, I understand the thing with answering imaginary interviews, I think I've also done it before, when I was younger :)nI also understand what you're saying about not being able to start conversations or to keep them going. I was exactly the same when I was in school, but I think it might be just your perception of yourself or the fact that you freak out in these moments (or at least that's how I was :D ). I've actually made a huge progress on that in the meantime and I've been told I come across as very sociable - so I can talk, no problem, I just don't say some things on some specific sensitive topics or when talking with guys. 'Cause you can have social anxiety and feel like you're dying inside, even though you're talking to almost everyone and looking very relaxed. But most of the time, I am relaxed, it's just a few situations where I'm still weirdly anxious.nnAnyway, the way I went from a super shy, barely talking teenager, to a sociable 24 year-old was just practice. You have to just go and start talking to people, without thinking about it or analyzing what you or they say, because no one does, except us with social anxiety. So it really doesn't matter, people forget what you say, they don't judge you based on a couple of conversations and you will meet tons of people in your life, although now it seems like everything about the people in your class matter, every word and gesture. But it's not like that, people are just people and you should just go and talk to them the way you do with anyone you're comfortable around. Ask whatever question, no matter how dumb it is, complain about a teacher or the weather, ask them anything you're curious about and listen (people love talking about themselves and in the meantime you have time to calm down), ask them following questions about their hobbies or their clothes or what they're doing after school or anything (and add empathetic responses like: Wow, awesome! Oh, that sucks... you get the idea). That's usually enough for having good conversations with just about anyone. And just don't allow yourself to think about it, to analyse, to evaluate the conversation, just let it flow.nnI know it seems very hard at first, but you just need practice. Talking to people is the same as anything else - you get better at it with practice - and people with social anxiety usually avoid it until they convince themselves they can't do it. So just start doing it, with small goals, like initiating one conversation every 2-3 days or in whatever rhythm is ok for you, give yourself positive feedback for everything, because you are doing something very difficult, don't create any expectations for any social interaction and you don't need anything else other than that - it'll all sort itself out, but don't create an image of how it should be, of how the sociable version of you will be and so on.nnSorry for the whole rant, but what you wrote really reminded me of myself and it's something that was really important to me, so I understand. I've also done therapy and for so long I thought this is just how I am, but now looking back I can't even believe how far I've come. So good luck and sorry if I've gone too far and said things that maybe don't apply to you :) I just got a bit swept away by the topic :D",1

854,"thatdudeinthecorner9","comment","","Yeah I go through the same thing with feeling like I am making progress with SA, but as soon as I get into a social situation the anxiety responses trigger. The way my therapist put it to me is that the survival centers of our brains recognize social situations as ""dangerous"" (because of our past negative cognitive experiences) so our brain triggers the ""fight, flight, or freeze"" response. Like I will be feeling super happy and confident on a day where I have meditated and I feel pretty comfortable with the idea of going out in public but as soon as I start heading to wherever, my body tenses up and I get these crazy hot flashes and start blushing, muscles tense up, feel like something is crawling in my skin, you know. Basically our brains go through the same physiological response as if we were about to get eaten by a bear or something.nnThe way I have been able to somewhat successfully deal with these responses is by taking deep breaths and pretty much telling myself that the only way to have positive social experiences is by eliminating negative thoughts and getting out of my head. I've found if you focus on the things in the environment you're in, it really helps to stop the negative thinking and also helps to distract your mind from wandering. nnThe other day I was waiting to get a haircut and I was doing exactly what I just described. When the stylist said she was ready for me, I sat down and immediately noticed the stylist had a tattoo over the back of her left hand. Since I wasn't really thinking about ""what if I say something stupid"" and was concentrating on that moment that I was in, I just kinda blurted out ""hey that is kinda cool, what is that a tattoo of?"". She told me it was just some bones and we started talking about it and kinda moved on to other conversation topics. I was honestly really proud of myself for having a decent conversation with a stranger and I realized that is only possible if you just get out of your head and live in the moment.nnIt also really helps if you internalize the fact that you are having automated responses that you don't have much control over. You just need to accept that this will happen and rather than trying to ignore it or ""brace yourself for impact"" so to speak, you accept that you will be triggered by certain things. For me, doing this has actually made it much easier to recognize when I'm fueling the anxiety attacks. Seriously, just say to yourself ""I'm having an anxiety attack and thats okay"" and then focus on what somebody is saying or on some weird or interesting thing going on around you. You will hopefully feel relaxed once you get out of your head.",1
855,"gideonrakthor","comment","","I know exactly how you feel, I even just made my own post about it. Unfortunately I think its something we have to solve from the inside out. In my major, you cant just get out of the presentation because it is a huge part of the curriculum. So I cant help you there. If you truly have pure raw anxiety that is without any logical reason, you could maybe get diagnosed for some anti anxiety drugs that you only take before those events. ",0

This is all new to me since I didn't know much about ADHD, I just knew that it was impossible for me to focus and I was constantly daydreaming. The combination of SA and ADHD sucks.

My philosophy on them is that they are essentially acting as a soundboard and an echo chamber so that you can build yourself up. Good psychologists throw you around a bit so that you can learn to cope - it's a form of therapy and it's only ever successful. So I dunno what sort of psychologist you have seen in the past. Maybe even try going to your GP and getting some advice there?nThe whole fear of judgement from people in authorative positions thing was something I was excruciatingly afraid of as well. But then I started observing why I was afraid of it. Turns out that humans have a tendency to just accept authority (like if a cop in uniform asks you for your ID, you are just about going to do it anyway regardless... they could be a fake in a costume). Always question authority I say, then that way you can determine whether it ought to be respected. I respect authority when it deserves to be - like doctors, nurses, hard working people.. But I don't respect assholes, dipshits and dickheads just because they have a ""place"" in wider society.nAlso, put yourself in the shoes of the person you are fearful of (ie boss). What are they looking for? How can you meet these targets? Are they after a specific type of person? nI remember once at university I didn't do the homework required as I was under a particularly stressful time in life, my anxiety and depression was getting the better of me. The tutor asked me if i did the work and i was honest enough to say no - but then she asked me WHY I didn't do it. Rather than answer that, I took a stand and said that she didn't need to know WHY I didn't do it. Just that I would do it and catch up. In other words, sometimes people who have authority have the tendency to use it in the wrong way. It's weird shit like that makes the difference. nI have like no money because I'm too anxious and I know I would collapse in a heap if I had to undergo a massive change. nThese things take time my friend. The fact you can do most things with a minor anxiety IS PROGRESS and you ought to congratulate yourself on that front.nMoving out and supporting yourself brings a sense of dignity and self respect I think.

I don't have any wise words, sorry. If it's not too daunting, maybe you can try talking to your parents or a school counselor or anyone else you trust about this. I wish you all the best.nnEDIT: I didn't mention depression because I don't know much about it, but I think all this advice applies, mutatis mutandis, to depression.

That I have at least a bit of value, and that the value other people give me is toxic. It gets me hooked on them to receive more and more, and thats bad because it reduced the weight of my own judgement towards myself.nnWhich is why I'm currently searching for new hobbies that I like, I didn't have many that I liked before and a bunch got ruined by other people when I was young. I'm realizing every so often that if I like myself, it doesn't matter that other people don't.nnI haven't figured out how to be more social or meet more people with whon I'm compatible yet, but I think that it might be easier once I actually have expanded my likes and know myself better.nnNowadays, I usually play my awkward turtle card upfront when I meet people just to show that I'm a bit more shy and have a bit more difficulty to socialize (implicitly). I was always the kind of person that was afraid of silence when hanging out with people. So I used the good kind of sarcasm to keep myself interesting or tried to push random pointless subjects like the weather into the mix just to have the conversation going. I recently tried to just not talk when I have nothing to say while strugfling inside to shut up that little voice that tells me I should cut the silence asap. And it worked out. I had more fun than I had in years because eventualy the voice shut itself up seeing everything was fine without me trying to do filler voice over.nnFrom this point, I started making a bit more friends because it was easier. Talking to different people at work got me invited to 3 or 4 parties and events in the past month, and for once, it felt like I wasn't invited by obligation, but rather because people really wanted me there. I even started lowering my guards a bit and saw that these people aren't attacking me.nnTLDR: Try things. Find your own happinness! Meet new people. And if it doesn't work out with them, its not necessarely that you're a bad person or that they're bad people, its just that it wasn't meant to be because you don't have compatible personnalities, or similar interests, or any of the other possible infinite reasons that doesn't make you a bad person or a non interesting person. No one to blame for that.

I have the kind of mind that can't stop overthinking, the kind thats always trying to find a logic to everything.nnSeeing a therapist might help you. It is certainly helping me. However, I have one huge piece of intel to give you: analyse your friendship with that one friend and ask yourself if that person is right for you.nnI'm just coming out of a year long intense friendship where I talked to the same person almost everyday. And it was super toxic for my loneliness, my pessimism and my self esteem. I fell into this confort zone with a friend with whom I had nothing in common at all, but whom felt like it was meant to be.nnThis relationship of mine has just ended as I pointed out after a fight that I felt like everything was toxic and that I wanted for us to just stop talking.nnEven though that wasn't a bad person at all, we were just very incompatible, and it was making me miserable without even noticing.nnSo, in your place, knowing what I now know, I would ask myself ""is this relationship making me happy?"", ""am I who I really want to be with this person?"", ""am I being held back by having this person in my life?""nnFor once, don't think about how that person feels, but think about how YOU feel. What do you really want? What are you expecting out of yourself?nnIf you think you're reaching what you want to be, and you are happy, there is no point in wondering what this person might think of you.nnMy therapist asked me these interesting questions: ""If you could hear what people thought about you on the spot, what would you do about it? Is it worth it to try to make that person change its mind? What would happen in yourself if you couldn't convince that person otherwise? Would it change a thing?""nnAsk yourself these questions very seriously. It helped me realize that no matter what I do, if someone thinks something about me, I'll never know for sure, even if I ask that person. And I can't necessarely change their minds. And if I were to make the efforts, it would be exhausting making sure everybody is happy with me. And I probably will never be happy if I were to constantly change for people.nnTherefore, I need to be myself, work on who I want to be and what makes me happy, and I'll attract other people who view me as interesting for who I am, even if I'm still that broken person inside. As long as I don't make a big deal out of it and just be happy with my life. And I'm already starting to see the results!

1285,"anxious1975","comment","","Hi thanks. I talk to my psychologist about this, and I look for jobs in other fields, and whenever I look, I get more depressed, because virtually every entry level I look at still requires specialization that I don't have, such as an undergrad degree in Finance, accounting. So I literally cannot even get jobs for recent college graduates even if they would consider someone my age. My law degree is worthless, I can't get any work in the field, it's useless outside of the field especially for someone with SA, severe SA. There are all sorts of books and articles on what you can do with a law degree besides law, and it's like ""be a real estate agent"" ""be in sales"" ""be in business"", stuff that I'd be equally horrible at since I can't form a coherent sentence when I'm under stress. And because so many lawyers who aren't handicapped like me want out of law, the few jobs are taken by them. I'm in my early 40s, I've literally got no marketable work experience. In my horrific field in the legal profession, there's only going to be management positions, most workers doing the crap work I do are being outsourced to lower cost areas, or replaced by software. If I were a professional morse code person I'd be more marketable, even though morse code isn't used anymore..nnIt's so bad, that my psychologist suggest ""why don't you drive from uber""? Besides the fact I'm a licensed attorney, my car is too old and it's a 2 door. i can't even do that even if I wanted a minimum wage job. And I can't afford it. I simply owe way too much money. Nobody is going to get me out of this but myself, and I don't have any confidence in that. I know nobody, I have zero connections, I'm handicapped by SA, and I'm screwed. I'm not at the point where I'm accepting that perhaps being homeless, creditors coming after me, won't be the end of the world, because I have no rational reason to believe things are going to improve, so I need to now cope with how bad things are going to get. I can't even discharge my student loans in bankruptcy, I could my other debt, but that there, bad credit for 7 years, who would hire someone with bad credit? I'd get disbarred (not like I'm going to get a lawyer job, but damn I spent 3 years, and 145k on my degree).. There's really no place in the world for someone like me. Nobody really cares, society cares more now about pedophiles than they do for someone like me. People out there who refuse to work, who get housing, all these benefits, and someone like me, desperate to work, can't get a job to save my life. It's like I'm a modern day leper. Though at least someone cared about the plight of lepers. I went to my bar association, asking for help, they basically said get lost. I can't go begging for lawyer jobs, even if I didn't have SA, that's not how you do it. I'm simply tainted in my profession. A leper, and that's likely going to carry on elsewhere as the same issues will handicap me pretty much anywhere but a retail job, and I can't survive on that.",1

I felt like he was condescending, or like he thought my problems were petty and hard to understand. Plus he talked too much about himself and the plants he had in his office. He was no help at all.nnThe second one was a therapist in training. My sessions with him helped a lot because he was young, because his personality and his interrogation style really suited me (most of it was questions I had never asked myself before). He (indirectly) helped me recognize my ""old thought patterns"" as well as my anxiety triggers, through reflection, introspection, and letting me talk/vent even when it felt aimless. Other than that, he analyzed my lifestyle, my social circles, my feelings about it all, what I used to be like 3-4 years ago, etc. It was a pretty comprehensive analysis, so all in all I give it a solid 9. I haven't felt the need to see my therapist ever since I stopped going (April of this year 2017). I still have anxious thoughts, but they're less frequent and I am fully aware of them, and of how to cope with them. It's mostly a matter of not letting my own guard down.nnIn my opinion you just have to keep looking and looking until you find a therapist that is right for you and is completely willing to help you out with your anxiety!

The funny thing is that I've already thought I had it around five years ago but I was hesitant (and still am) because ""personality disorder"" sounds like a whole other league than ""only"" anxiety. But the description of it fits me perfectly and much more than SA. I fit all the criteria from both ICD-10 and DSM-5 for AvPD. Just a few days ago I wondered why something like extreme self-consciousness wasn't classified as a disorder.nnWhat I think is one of the biggest differences is that I usually don't feel actual fear/panic (with shivering, fast heartbeat, sweating etc.). I've only had one panic attack so far and it wasn't during a social setting. I'm very tense in public, but I wouldn't call it afraid. Like you, I'm estranged to my whole family and I even had a close friend who I suddenly couldn't talk to normally anymore, like she was a stranger but she really wasn't. I became suicidal when I was told at an (involuntary) internship that I smiled too little and that people complained about me because of it. I get wasted on days I feel like people dislike me (like when coworkers don't sit down next to me at work, or ignore me when I ask a question). And after trying to unsuccessfully socialise at work for a week, I fell back into my cold/distant self and do awkward stuff like walking 10 meters behind my coworkers on my way to work, instead of running up to them, because I don't want to annoy them or get the feeling they're annoyed by me. I don't know - maybe I do have SA and not AvPD after all. I think AvPD describes me way better, but the two disorders are so similar it's a bit confusing. I should bring it up with my therapist.",1

1409,"NudaeVetatur","comment","","ANT stands for Automatic Negative Thoughts in the social anxiety disorder context. Some of these might be obvious for you eg. ""No point in going to that meeting, because I will mess up anyway"", others might not be so easy to identify at first. From my personal experience, I used to feel anxious in some situations and when my therapist asked me ""but why?"" I couldn't say anything, I just ""felt"" anxious and that was it. Only after really profoundly thinking about these issues and situations, going through them and paying attention, was I able to start finding words for what exactly it was that caused me to become anxious.nnThat was the first step, getting to know what your ANTs are. Second step is to rephrase the ANT so that it is not so negative, but remain realistic. The above example could be rephrased like: Although there have been some times that I've messed up at such social gatherings, I have also had positive ones and if nothing else then this will provide me with a possibility to learn social interaction"" (you really need to personalise it for yourself). And do it for all ANTs. nnThird step is to recognize the exact moment that one of the ANTs arises in your mind. You want to get so good that you never become anxious without knowing why.nnForth follows the third - once recognised, immediately rephrase to what you did in step 2. This needs to become automatic.nnWhile steps 1 and 2 are purely analytical and a concept for you to accept, 3 and 4 need exposure. This is why it can be dangerous for the SAD person to ""just get out of your comfort zone and just do it"" when not prepared.nnJust a tip: I found it extremely helpful to say ""I'm feeling that I'm..."" ""I'm thinking that I'm.."" when trying to describe my anxiety or thoughts instead of ""I'm..."". Eg. I'm thinking that they must hate me for being so quiet vs They must hate me for being so quiet.

1492,"ComradeClout","comment","","Heres my current situation: I have had debilitating anxiety for a really long time, and it has been wrecking havoc on my life. I can have a panic attack from just thinking about being in a social situation and I’m in an almost constant state of panic when im around people or being outside in public. I am also underweight and constantly lose a lot of weight because of the stress from the anxiety and because I cant eat and lose my appetite when I’m anxious, which is too often. I also have high blood pressure as a result of my anxiety as well. It has caused me to miss out on many opportunities, and meeting new people The social affects the anxiety has had on me has ruined my school experience so far, and made me very reclusive and not able to make friends or hang out at parties and having a normal school life and pretty much alienated me. Not being able to talk to people and having near constant panic attacks has also negatively effected my academics and sometimes I can’t even go to class because the panic attack i get before is so bad, or i have a panic attack in class and have to leave and miss the whole lecture or whatever we are doing. I wouldn’t say i have been able to manage it so far, because i cant live a normal fulfilling life or make new friends or get a job, but i have been able to reduce the severity of attacks by doing certain breathing exercises and listening to music. I decided when i got to college, enough was enough and i didn’t wanna just keep barely scraping by with my anxiety anymore and i sought help from the campus therapist who said she thought i should try medication and recommended me to the nurse practitioner who prescribed me Lexapro. I took it for a few weeks and it didn’t help at all with my anxiety and had some unpleasant side effects, i told the nurse practitioner and she upped the dose but it still doesn’t help at all, and my grades are suffering really badly from missing class because of my anxiety so i was desperate for a solution so i started “self medicating” by smoking cigarettes to cope with the panic attacks and anxiety, which i know aren’t good for you (my grandparents died from smoking and many people in my family have complications like emphazima from it) and are very addicting but its more effective than anything else and I couldn’t afford to miss anymore class. I told both the n.p. and the therapist that i picked up smoking to help with the anxiety because the lexapro isn’t working and they said to just continue on the lexapro as i have been and didn’t seem too worried that i started smoking cigarettes to alleviate my symptoms",1

I smoke weed occasionally and while it’s fun and I have met some cool people by smoking weed, it’s not an effective anxiety medication and sometimes exacerbates my social anxiety.

1520,"HighInquiry","comment","","I don't think you need a diagnosis to say you have social anxiety or depression but that doesn't matter. What I recommend is to explain to them that you have social anxiety but just don't explain it like a mental illness. Avoid using medical terms like ""anxiety"" or ""condition"" and just say something like ""I am afraid of talking to people"" or ""I get unreasonably upset when I have to interact with people"". Something that'll get across how you're feeling without assigning a name to it. If they brush you off then just stay honest however you can. Whether you have to tread back to your room defeated or if you can be insistent, as long as you show how you feel you can't be accountable for not getting it through to them. I don't know how narcissistic your parents are but if they are reasonable people who just have some misconceptions about mental illness it shouldn't be that impossible to get them to understand your situation.

1546,"najanin","comment","","It does, it really does. Though, you have to make an effort to go where you want to grow. I did not go to highschool at ALL due to SA. I know exactly how you feel about missing out, wasting your youth, and hiding from the world in your room. This has been my life for the last 6 years. I’ve caught myself on sites like Omegle, in chat rooms with probably, pedophiles and 13 year olds, because I just craved HUMAN interaction. That’s how low my lowest was. I didn’t care if we liked the same shit, I didn’t care about an age difference, or a computer virus obviously. I just wanted to talk to people. I cried from feeling like I was going crazy, missing having friends, missing talking to anyone outside of my immediate family. Missing being able to walk outside of my home, and not feeling like I was on some type of emotional house arrest. I’ve been there. I’m sure you’ve had days where you don’t get out of bed, simply because you have nothing to do. You may be full of energy, you might actually feel like socializing, but you don’t have the friends, you don’t have the resources. You’re frustrated, yet still anxious, and don’t know how to go about breaking out of your box. The first step, is literally just taking a first step. Understand that you are not your past, you are not your current situation, you are not your mental illness. You may be going through this or that, feeling this or that, but none of this shit is who you are and you shouldn’t let it dictate that, what you can do about it now, who you’ll be, or what you will be doing in the future. I’ve heard and now know this to be true, that we are best able to forge our character, opinions, etc., in solitude. We are able to strengthen, acquire, heal, all of these things in solitude. You’re in a position where you are ultimately able to form yourself, everything about yourself, the best version of yourself. Away from society, free of influence, free of judgement. You have low self esteem? This is literally the best time, this time you feel vulnerable, to do the best that you can do to be patient with yourself, to be understanding of yourself, to be kind to yourself, to perform acts of love for yourself. This is so important, if you’re spending most of your time alone. You are either your best friend right now, or your worst enemy. Loving and even accepting yourself is a journey. But start somewhere, nurture, be there for, and do what you can for yourself, right now. And however little or much that is, is enough, because it’s a first step. I have one rule for you, and that is progress. I understand that healing is not linear, you will fall stagnant. Like I have, like I do. The most important thing is that you get back up. Take time with yourself. You need to be selfish as fuck right now, I’m serious. I know for me, when I don’t take care of myself and my needs, it’s becomes very hard to nurture everything around me. It is hard to be present (MAJOR KEY) with family, with school, work, with myself. You must give yourself permission to put yourself first. Water your personal experience with love so that you’re able to share yourself, when you are ready, with others in a way that is meaningful and intentional. This will make involuntary solitude, much more bearable, even enjoyable. When you are content or happy with yourself, you will more than likely finally feel okay to share yourself and your time with others. I tried therapy, not for me. Tried meds, worked temporarily, knew that wasn’t going to fix shit but my panic attacks. I knew it was something deeper, so I dug deeper. When friends and family first started to notice my developing anxiety, they’d say things like, “It’s all in your head!” Yea here’s a smart boy point. It’s a MENTAL illness. I was very frustrated no one understood this, and then I realized. As are my thoughts, and my feelings. Not invalidating them, they’re definitely real but they are simply of themselves. THOUGHTS, and FEELINGS. When I realized everything that was holding me back, many insecurities, were nothing but thoughts (what if this happens, what if they hate me, what if I’m ugly), and feelings, (I’m scared that.. I hope they.. I feel like..). The game fuckin changed. You have the ability to train yourself, to change both of these things. Not saying you do, but if you’re telling yourself any type of sob story or enjoy acting helpless. You need to stop right now. Nothing and/or no one is going to be able to help you, unless you help yourself. And you will be, by throwing away a victim’s mindset. So you’re able to see what you’re experiencing for what it really is. Only then will you be able to understand what really needs to be done, to make progress from that point on. I’m 17 dude, I’ve been dealing with this shit since I was 11. I don’t know how old are you, but the older you get and less you do about it, the longer you will experience this and the more severe it will be. I’m not a parent or someone who’s never experienced what you are, telling you to get over it or to just do it. Though honestly, the thing that really helped me to remain calm in and just be able to function in social settings, was just doing it. More, and more often. You don’t have to every day, you don’t want to overwhelm yourself. But challenge yourself. To get something you’ve never had or be somewhere you’ve never been, you have to do something you’ve never done. Sounds like common sense, but took forever for me to grasp that. If you or anyone reading this needs to talk, not even strictly about this, if you need a friend. Hit my DMs. I’m not as serious as this post, I just really believe and want you to know, that it does get better. It’s trial and error, but it does. ",1

I am 19 and in college, and have a few friends; however, I have severe SAD and I really don't do much/meet new people. I am avoidant, but I still participate in major-related clubs and whatnot. nnI have a fantastic psychiatrist who I see daily for meds. I don't receive therapy of any kind, as I don't see the benefit  from it (previously did receive therapy). I waited until the summer after my freshman year of college to seek mental health treatment for my SAD and ADHD. I had friends in school, whom I could talk to in class and crack jokes, but I never had friends that I could go out with. I was usually in the house, playing video games or at the gym. I've been a loner for many years, like yourself, I presume.nnI wrote a post here detailing my full history, so that you could get a better understanding and maybe it may help you in your situation: https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/7ieskm/need_med_help_whats_after_klonopin_my_first_benzo/nnI've been on low doses of the following meds.: Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Vistaril, and Gabapentin. These were prescribed by a shitty RN at a university behavioral centernnWhen I got my new insurance, I immediately found a really good psychiatrist by my univeristy, who I now see monthly. I've been prescribed Adderall IR and XR, Wellbutrin (high dose), Prozac (high dose), and most recently and importantly, Klonopin. I've had 3 appointments thus far, and we adjust and add/remove meds. every session. Finding the right combination takes time. I was first prescribed Klonopin .5mg daily, as I told her my SAD was not improving. So, she changed the dose to 2x 1mg a day. It really did not have much of an  improvement, so I called and asked for an increase. Now, I'm on 3x 1mg a day. Klonopin does not work for me. It doesn't for a lot of people, but it does for many others. For some, Klonopin will change their fuc**** life. SSRI's are garbage, IMO. I only have SAD and ADHD and they don't work for either. You want a benzo. I don't know what country you're from and who your psychiatrist is (some are more liberal in prescribing benzos), but I would highly suggest trying to get a benzo prescription. They will work wonders for anxiety. There are many risks, however. They're addictive and have hellish withdraw symptoms. Next appointment, I'm going to ask to be put on Xanax or Valium. Since I'm already on 3mg a day of Klonopin and have  experience with benzos, this won't be an issue. I just don't respond to Klonopin, maybe. Xanax is the holy grail of benzos. nnDo you see a psychiatrist or are you on any medications?",1
1613,"thatdudeinthecorner9","comment","","Well I had mild anxiety that I guess I started noticing in Junior HS, it progressively got worse until I reached a point where I couldn't actually act like myself anymore. By the time I was 19 it was really bad. I ended up quitting my job because I couldn't handle pressure whatsoever and I basically became a full time hermit, I had to move back in with my step dad because I was emotionally unstable and suicidal at that point.nnI sat at home playing video games and trying to forget everything until I just reached a point where I couldn't even numb myself that way. A little less than a year ago I started going to therapy out of desperation. I did two 1 hour sessions a month at first and it was only mildly helpful. My therapist eventually got training in EMDR and started performing that treatment on me. The EMDR basically helps your brain to reprocess traumatic and uncomfortable memories in a way that don't cause you to have adverse reactions in similar situations.nnThe therapy is still ongoing and there is a long way for me to go, but I've come so far that it's almost difficult to imagine being as socially anxious as I was before. Every once in a while, something will *click* for me and a particular symptom of my anxiety will be lessened or absent going forward.nnAnyways, I'd very much recommend that you talk to a therapist if you can't make progress on your own with social anxiety. My problems are far deeper than just social anxiety, but I've seen vast improvements in my overall quality of life since beginning therapy. I can actually leave my house and smile at people in public and just remain generally calm, although I'm still kind of struggling with more intense SA surrounding interactions with women. But it's just taken awhile to get to that specific issue, because I have so many damn issues to work through.nnI wish you luck in dealing with your SA!

1705,"JSchultz94","comment","","It’s quite possible. I have social anxiety and experience some of the things you have listed. The biggest difference between shyness and SA is the negative feelings/emotions that come along with SA. Here’s a helpful article if you’d like to read more about it: nnhttp://affinitymagazine.us/2016/12/18/the-difference-between-introversion-social-anxiety-disorder-and-shyness/nnThere’s nothing wrong with having SA, as discouraging and frustrating as it can be sometimes. You learn to work through some of the situations that make you anxious. Also, doing those things over and over again makes it less intimidating over time. Just an example - I’m 23 years old and for as long as I can remember, I hated having my blood pressure taken when I went to the doctor or dentist. Even if I wasn’t feeling anxious to begin with, my BP would shoot up when they put the cuff on my arm, nurse would see that my BP was high and ask if I was nervous every single time. It made me so self conscious and worsened my anxiety/made me dread going to appointments. This morning I went to the dentist and my BP was 91/69. I’m finally starting to get over that fear and just relax when I get there. It takes time but it’s possible. Hope that helps!",0

1707,"notevenclosebabie","comment","","I don't know. I know these things, but there is no magical ""stopping"" for me. Rational thinking and logic don't work because my body thinks otherwise or something. I've been in therapy for years and none of them knew what to do. I think it's a defense mechanism. My therapist diagnosed me with PTSD from emotional and physical abuse and neglect during my childhood. Home wasn't safe and school wasn't either, I was being bullied there too and nobody would help me. I learned to just stay home in my room by myself for years. I think it's just so ingrained I literally have no idea how else to live. How do I just stop? How do I betray my own experiences and what I know of the world and coping mechanisms and self defenses and just start trusting the people that my brain tells me will hurt me, like they always do? Everything you're saying makes SENSE but it hurts and makes me angry at you for even suggesting it as if I never thought of it before even though I know you're making sense and trying to help but because I can't just STOP... How am I supposed to do this all on my own? It doesn't feel fair. I never asked for this. It feels like they made me this way. Why should I be the one fixing it? It feels like there's no patience for this kind of thing in society and interpersonal relationships. This isn't something I experience when I talk about my other traumatic experiences with abuse; they understand why it hurts and it's so hard. But I feel like people just want me to get over my social anxiety.nnI know it's probably all in my head but it feels so real. I tune into every little thing and either end up dissociating or running away. I listen intensely and try to figure out everything about people just so I have the upper hand. And it's a self fulfilling prophecy.  I feel this way, so I am this way. But I just don't know how to stop.",1

1723,"bodyintherye","comment","","For me it was like the other person who posted about circumstances. I started working for this company where literally every single person except for ONE other guy, is an extrovert. Seriously, and aside from that many of them couldn’t and still don’t understand anxiety. The mere concept of it is mind boggling them but they were understanding of me and had seen me freak out a few times so they didn’t push anything on me but still invited me out and that made all the difference. When I felt comfortable enough that’s when I went out with them and funny enough that’s when my now bf (who worked for a different department) decided to go out with them too. Before that point, I grew comfortable with them in the office and I think that’s because being that they are SO extroverted they would just keep talking to me and trying to get to know me. Without that there’s no way I could’ve gotten to know my bf and I told him that. Before him I couldn’t even imagine myself holding someone’s hand or kissing someone (it had been a while since either one of those had happen and I was extremely uncomfortable those times) let alone being in an entire relationship with someone. I never saw it happening for myself. nnNow what I do want to say is I know exactly what the feeling is like. I spent so many years yearning and fantasizing on being in a relationship while “accepting” it would never happen for me but what I wish I could’ve know is how much work it would require. Now that’s not to scare you OP or anyone reading this! Relationships (of all kinds) can be incredibly beautiful and help you grow in so many ways. I just wish someone had told me what I’m about to say and it’s the idea that’s it’s not just you anymore. You are going to be spending lots of time with this person who may not even know what anxiety is, can’t read when you’re about to have an anxiety attack or understand why something is making you particularly anxious. It’s to be expected because it’s just starting out. nnSo the best advice I can give, for relationships and friendships is be UNDERSTANDING of yourself and why you are the way you are and that will make a WORLD of a difference. You can’t always expect people to understand you but it’s 100x worse if you don’t understand yourself. Because if you do you can become better at communicating your needs and feelings and the right people will work with you. Not only that, the anxiety does have to take a backseat sometimes. That’s the biggest thing I’ve learned from my coworkers and bf. They’re constantly doing things they don’t necessarily want to do but do anyway for the sake of going after what they want. It turns out my bf doesn’t particularly like my coworkers but went out with them that night for the sake of getting a chance to know me. So sometimes if there’s something you really want to do you will have to try and work hard at acknowledging the anxiety and why you feel it but doing the thing anyway. It’s different from something making you feel extremely uncomfortable and it producing a result you don’t want anyway. But if something could potentially lead to something good and your anxiety flares up? Try it anyway. nnA good tip for making friends is remain as true to yourself as possible and focus less on being interesting and more in being interested in the other person. People find it easier to talk when they feel like you’re genuinely interested and will most likely reciprocate the attention. If they don’t well you just polished up on your conversation skills. nnSorry for the incredibly long response but I see posts like this and I felt the same way for the longest time. My anxiety isn’t cured by any means but I have learned how to begin managing it (I’ve also been going to therapy) and I found a lot of fear came from fearing how people would perceive me. It’s still there when I meet new people but for the most part the fear isn’t AS strong. A lot of fear was also thinking the absolute WORST would happen and 95% of the time nothing terrible ever happens. Good luck with everything and I hope something I said could be of some help. ",1

1754,"cloverfreak","comment","","I went through the exact same thing last year. I was terrified of going outside because of panic attacks. I thought if I wasn't at home I wasn't safe from them. I was diagnosed with panic disorder and my therapist suggested I go outside for timed periods. So go for a walk for five minutes, then come home. Then ten minutes another day, then come home.  I'm not going to lie, I didn't always do this ""homework"" she set for me but it did help just getting out more. She also told me to ride out panic attacks instead of seeking comfort and coping techniques. My coping was reaching for my phone as a distraction or gulping down water from a bottle I couldn't leave the house without or fleeing from the room/building/environment I was in . If you feel panic coming on just stay where you are and let your body feel it and accept it. It's really hard  I know. But once you let yourself feel it, you'll then feel yourself come out of it absolutely fine and alive. My biggest issue was relying on coping techniques. I wouldn't leave the house without a water bottle or rescue remedy. Some days I do feel anxiety about going outside but I honestly don't know where I would be without my old therapists advice.

I’d say on a scale of 0-100% , 0% being no effect and 100% being total relief of anxiety SSRI’s like Zoloft gave me 25-30% relief. nnEver since I had my first benzodiazepine that’s all I wanted for anxiety which is part of the reason I didn’t like SSRI’s because in my head even if the antidepressants helped me I wanted the xanax or klonopin to be totally anxiety free, but benzos get nasty when you use them long term and aren’t really sustainable to take daily and contribute to society etc. nnI would say SSRI’s are a good first line to try medication, they didn’t do amazing things for me but they did help which was better than nothing, but because of the side effects I quit them and I’m on no antidepressant medication now. My main side effects were sexual dysfunction and not feeling any emotion... I never felt happy but I never felt sad which I didn’t like.

1971,"jerkirkirk","comment","","First of all thanks a lot for your comment. I was about to cry the first time I read it. I didn't expect this when I wrote my post. nnI talked about my anxiety with a friend, the closest one I ever had. And that was helpful, but it gave me a break, it didn't help to solve anything. I used to write down my thoughts also, but I noticed it was just a way to over-over-think about those feelings. nAbout the crush,,, I don't think it's the same. I mean I really don't know her. She hangs out with my group (not always) but that is the only time I see her. 0 other contacts, and I swear I tried many times something like 2 years ago. Now I sincerely have no hope, I just wish She leaves the group in any way (She did many times, I'm not being mean, She evidently has more choices  to spend her time with) , telling her about my feelings would just make things more complicated, and no illusion is worth trying at this point. I also have 0 experience, so it's hard to tell if that caring I wrote about is anything more than just her being good in relating with anyone she meets.nnI know everybody has their demons, I didn't mean everybody is happy around me. Everyone in my group is struggling with his own issues. I also know that even the happiest person around me has (or had) some issues.nBefore anxiety I spent a lot of time in a depressed mood, even if I never got to a terapist for a real diagnosis. But it was way better, because it wasn't so paralyzing, I could still enjoy being with my friends even if I always looked sad. Anxiety is a lot worse. nI also can't really think good about others. I understand why they do what they do, and I know that I would do the same. But it's all about being selfish, it's all about sticking to social standards. I know there are good people, but They are just a part of humanity. nnI can be proud of what I am, but I cannot be blind to my issues. I know I've got amazing friends, and I'm thankful for that. But I also know that it was luck or something, I didn't do so much to build those relationship. I also have to notice how hard is for me to get to know new people, to build something more than a shallow knowledge of eachother. Maybe there is light at the end of the tunnel, but you need to reach its end and I made very few steps in the last 4-5-6 years. And I always tried to get out of my comfort zone, because it would have been a lot more depressing if I just left every time. But it didn't work. nI'm about 20 now, hope must die sooner or later. I know I'll try again this summer, I know I have to. But I'm disillusioned, I'm fighting to keep what I already have, I'm not improving myself.

1975,"badmonkingpin","comment","","I think this answer is more apt for social awkwardness than social anxiety disorder.

From a psychologist.nnIndeed psychiatrists are basically medical specialists who took a bit of neurology, they are not psychologists and will not give you psychological assistance. They're only there to prescribe medication, and if that's not appropriate their job is done.nnReducing anxiety in your life is 95&amp;#37; pure coping skills, of learning how to talk to yourself in a more helpful and encouraging manner, how to improve your self-image, and learning how anxiety distorts reality to make everything feel far more negative than it is.nnYour thoughts and beliefs are the fuel and oxygen that keep the anxiety flaring high, trapping you in your own life. This especially applies to people that have traits like being highly sensitive in general (deep processing and sensory sensitivities) and being quite perfectionistic (which feeds the constant tension of feeling like not even your best is good enough to be acceptable).nnTherapy will help you learn how to deprive the anxiety of this fuel so it can be reduced to just a background flicker, that you can push past with more confidence when you decide it matters to do so.nnMedication by itself can only help break the cycle of fear-&gt; avoidance -&gt; loss of confidence and self-image -&gt; more fear, at a stage where improving confidence and self-image are not sufficient to push past anxiety so high it causes things like paralysis, panic attacks and blackouts at even minor challenges, sabotaging any attempt to get better at an early stage.nnIf your anxiety is 'mild', it means you stand a chance that getting yourself together mentally will be sufficient to help you cope better at start experiencing successes for yourself. It doesn't mean your fear isn't real or your problem doesn't exist, but it does indicate that at the very least, your stress system isn't at 'hair trigger instant meltdown' levels of overstrained.nnThat's a good thing. Follow their advice, get professional support in helping you learn the coping skills you need to put out the fires, one step at a time. This stuff takes time, but there honestly is no more effective and long-lasting 'cure' than to learn these life skills that will help you cope not just with anxiety, but pretty much any challenge or disappointment or difficulty life could throw at you.nnAnd you're worth that support, you really are. It's not a blemish that you need help, you didn't choose to be this way. You just didn't learn the lessons yet that therapy can teach you, because growing up people didn't get around to teaching them to you. Nobody figures this out on their own,  and sometimes it may take some looking around to find the right lessons from the right people. Give yourself the right to searching for the tools you need to have a good life, together with mentors that have experience and understanding that you don't have yet.nnLook for a therapist, truly.

You can always go back to poor coping skills and reject what you'll be offered, but why would you NOT want to 'never go back'. Getting therapy is making the decision to leaning how to leave some crap behind, not signing up for worse stuff.nnYou get support, someone to report progress with and get advice from, for as long as you need, and if you get the feeling your tutor isn't actually helping you improve your understanding and skill at all, you find a different one that does get you placed.nnI mostly felt guilty because my parents paid for my sessions, but I was fed the fuck up with only ever getting myself more stuck and down, and the least I could do was admit that maybe I needed someone to actually pay attention to my issues with me and help me figure out what the hell to do about them.nnAbout the stigma? Fuckno, that's never bothered me and it shouldn't bother you either. Whether you put a bandage on a cut or not, the cut is there, and you're only doing the mature and responsible thing by cleaning and dressing it properly. The idea that getting support from a person specifically equipped to grant it (instead of trying to do everything alone or hoping that the people in your current environment, the environment that is reinforcing the shame, could help you) is somehow 'shameful' and that 'admitting you're not superhuman and flawless and able to do everything yourself' is a lifelong blemish itself is a totally dysfunctional belief that won't do you ANY favours by sticking to it.nnI personally didn't have your specific hurdles, but many people do. Regardless of whether they're unique or not though, please try to understand that these are distortions that are keeping you from making your life better. Fuck what shitty judgmental assholes might think from their shitty little toxic minds, try giving more weight to what decent, understanding, respectful, realistic-thinking, kind people would tell you.nnThe ideas of blemish and being 'broken forever' by seeing a therapist are just mind spooks. They're not worries to take seriously.nnWhat this DOES show is yet another belief, yet another idea about the world that adds to the pile of that whole constellation of anxiety-generating thoughts that's worth prying into and bit by bit whisking out the door. Your life will feel a lot less stuffy and cluttered with pointless restricting unhelpful concerns, leaving you way more space to live and grow and do yourself justice.nnChoosing to do the work is an asset, is a good thing, not something shameful. The only people who'd tell you it's shameful are the ones too afraid to get rid of their own spooks, so to try and not feel like cowards they try to tell everyone else it's normal to be a judgey jerk and people who are living life to the fullest are somehow the ones who are wrong.nnNah.

2374,"AmazingMazen","comment","","18/M. This was me during an internship that lasted a year. Heavy anxiety. Depression. Suicidal thoughts. Panic attacks. In the beginning I thought ""Whatever, this is probably normal. It'll get better with time"" but that's just not the truth (at least for me). My boss was actually pretty cool, we could chat about our favorite movies and tv shows and he wouldn't get angry at me if I did a mistake. I felt like he really knew what was going on with me so he was very nice to me even under stress. But oh well, unfortunately he was mostly working in his own room which means that I couldn't get to work with/for him often. So my stupid bitch of a coworker took the leader role and fucking treated me and the other intern like shit. She couldn't comprehend what me and the other intern (she was also really anxious) were going through. It made me fucking scared to go to work cuz I always had that gut feeling that this is gonna be another day where I prove myself a failure. It was hell. Every morning I woke up thinking about what I'm gonna do wrong today. I always tried to suppress my anxiety by being ""fake happy"". This was especially problematic in front of customers. One time my coworker embarrassed me in front of a friendly customer - she told me to help him with something even though I didn't know how. So I was just standing there, mumbling a few words out of my mouth and stuttering like ""How can I help you?"" or ""uhmm let me see"" while trying to find a solution to his problem that I just didn't have. A minute goes by and she yells at me, telling me to go away. I remember hearing this old man say ""Hey please don't yell at him"". That was one moment where I just wanted to cry but tried to supress it. Went to the toilet and had an anxiety attack. This happened a lot. When the other intern cried a few times my coworker told her to just go to the toilet and cry there. This furthermore showed me that I shouldn't cry during work. So I cried after my shift was over. Eventually one day I almost tried to kill myself after a very rough day. I went to the lake at night, stared at the water and had a panic attack. I told myself ""Come on, it's only a few weeks until it's over. You can do it! You've a come a long a way, you can't give up *now*!""  Fortunately that was 2 years ago and I think my SA has gotten better, mostly because I'm not dealing with that pressure that I had on me during this internship anymore. I still get flashbacks from that time occasionally. Sometimes I hear the voice of that angry coworker telling me I'm a failure. But Right now I'm studying computer science and I think it made me less anxious cuz every student is just kinda living for themselves and that's how I like it. Although the thought of going through this someday one more time makes me scared. I guess one thing that I've learned is that you shouldn't blame yourself for everything you do wrong. I used to do this. I was always like ""She is right! You're just a failure and a crybaby!"" but after that internship ended I realized that this is not how somebody should be treated at work, especially not an insecure, anxious 16 y/o intern. So please OP, remember not to blame it on yourself. There are real assholes living in this world who will blame you for their behaviour. DON'T GIVE UP CHAMP. YOU CAN DO IT.nEdit: Holy shit I didn't realize I wrote an essay here. Sorry haha I hope it's not too long.

They can help you develop strategies to lower your anxiety and recommend medications (note: medication is not a must). It sounds like your parents know about your anxiety, so, if it's easier for you, you could ask them to set up an appointment for you.nnMindful meditation helps me with stress. The basic idea is to sit and feel your emotions and body. Don't try to hold the anxiety back, just feel it and get to know it a bit better. Try to avoid thinking and just focus on what you feel, what you hear, how you breath etc. The idea is that over time, you learn to be stressed without it negatively affecting you. It's a weird idea, but basically you can feel anxious without being unhappy.nnAs far as the job goes, I guess I would start by getting your life outside of the job together.

2608,"nexexaxxa","comment","","As a 21 year old that's still struggling with this, maybe I can provide some insight.nnYou're probably going to hate me for saying this, but no matter how mentally painful or exhausting school is for you, you must stick at it. I know SA is bullshit, school is bullshit, but grades matter -- especially if you want to progress into college. I want to do college but it will take a long time to re-sit everything if I was to do it now (Computer Science). I'm not necessarily talking about dropping out, but attendance will take a hit from a LOT of people with SA.nnI had no friends in school, got bullied verbally by students and teachers, I just couldn't deal with the anxiety and couldn't even defend myself. I had absolutely no career prospects and my home life was hell (I think a large part of my anxiety comes from my raising, I still get huge anxiety when i hear arguments due to those of my parents -- although i was never physically abused, it still fucks with me). Dropped out of school at 14 due to suicidal thoughts and trying to harm myself (for attention) when forced to go to school -- I was damn afraid. Not much has changed, I think I've grown a lot as a person and my english has improved and I've made friends online which are amazing, but you will likely struggle for your entire life, and you need to understand that now rather than later.nnI feel more outgoing as I have aged, I feel the older I get the less serious I take things. You should try to take life less seriously -- not to infer you should stop caring about anything -- but I notice I over analyze shit 24/7, in reality they probably thought about that stupid thing I said for 5 seconds had a laugh then moved on. I know how this illness feels, you feel absolutely terrible and at the lowest point after you 'fail' something socially, and once it gets better you will try to distract yourself from whatever you have to do the next day. You can't sleep because your mind constantly regurgitates the same worries -- especially when there is something which will make you part of the social 'spotlight'.nn&amp;#x200B;nnHow is your family? Are they supportive? Do they know about your condition? nnTherapy can help, medication can help. Nothing is 100%, in-fact medication can be dangerous and increase suicidal thoughts etc -- thats why they tell your parents to monitor you when minors take them. CBT will have a positive effect on you however, if it doesn't actually help your anxiety you will still get the confidence and ability to talk about your problem.nnIf you don't already, you could try some fitness activities/training -- I know I felt much better after getting physically fit and it gave me something to do while stressed.nn&amp;#x200B;nnBest of luck.",0

2895,"AbominableMelon","comment","","I don't know if there's much advice I can offer, but I hope you can take comfort in knowing that you're not alone. I've wanted to give up on everything, but I still haven't yet.nnI had an elementary school teacher who would actually discuss how quiet I was with the rest of the class, right in front of me. I would cry when I got home. My parents talked to him, but it didn't really help because I don't think anyone—including me at the time—realized how seriously he was fucking up my mental health and destroying my confidence. nnI never dated in high school, and could not even talk to a guy I liked until university. Even then it was a horrendous struggle. At 21 I had already accepted that I would probably be alone forever. Now have a long term boyfriend whom I live with, but it's not easy like I had expected it to be. Nearly every day I find a reason to tell myself he's tired of me or doesn't really love me. We are thankfully pretty good at communicating, but it still feels like there's a cement wall in my mind. This wall is separating me from the happy and normal part of me. No matter how hard I try to knock it down through writing and discussing my feelings, I barely crack it. Sometimes I make a lot of progress, but it gets built back up.nnSomething I learned in therapy was that we create our own narratives about what people think of us. For example, some of the times I've convinced myself that my boyfriend doesn't want me around, I gather my courage and share how I'm feeling (please note that this is after being together for over four years, and I would *never* have been able to attempt this even six months ago). His responses are always reassuring; like he simply has something work-related on his mind or something like that. This partially makes me feel better, but then a part of me spirals and starts thinking, ""well he's just saying that because he's too nice and *really* he doesn't want me around because who could ever want me…"" Through therapy I finally understood that I project my own insecurities onto people, and they get reflected back at me. Essentially if I'm currently hating myself, I automatically assume pretty much everyone I encounter must hate me and wish I wasn't around. I'm mentioning this because maybe this guy you were talking to was actually feeling a bit nervous and self-concious himself? Though really you don't know for sure what anyone is feeling, and can't control what they feel. Feeling better about yourself and loving yourself is what really helps. Obviously that's not something that can be done by simply flipping a switch. Wish it were that easy.  nnWell it looks like I've replied to your wall of text with my own wall of text. Hopefully something is helpful, or something makes sense at least. I guess I'll just say a few more things to wrap this up. Try to continue with therapy, and maybe do group therapy? I know how horrifying that may sound, but it might help to meet other people who experience life like you do. Also, you may just need to find the right therapist. A good one really makes a difference. Keep writing your feelings, and keep listening to music. I have a huge playlist for when I feel like a waste of space; quite a bit of it is metal. I like to get lost in it. Lastly, this is something that helped me around your age: think of your life as a book. Childhood is the introduction, the teenage years are the prologue, your 20s are chapter 1, and so on. Your life is still beginning, and it's very likely that your best years are still to come. That doesn't mean social anxiety and other shit feelings won't still be with you, but it'll be different.  I can say with certainty that there's just so much growth between your teens and 20s, and I expect more as life continues. I feel like there's more I want to say, but can't quite put it into words—though really I've written enough words. Now I just want to send you a virtual hug.  ",1

3015,"TheWorldFuckedMe","comment","","Most normal people living normals lives actually do experience social anxiety and other anxieties very regularly, but for most people it's a normal function that keeps them on top of their game naturally. General anxiety or social anxiety becomes a *disorder* when it actually negatively affects their lives in the way of avoiding situations that bring the feeling, even when they realize avoiding those situations is damaging to themselves, that's the diagnosis you're referring to and it's an important distinction.",0
3016,"TheWorldFuckedMe","comment","","My point is it's unsurprising they don't understand, because they do feel the *exact* same social anxiety as you so in their heads they don't get why you don't take it upon yourself to react the same way they do. Start calling your problem, social anxiety disorder, by the proper name because that's the beginning of the confusion for other people like your friends trying to understand you. They think you're talking about getting diagnosed with social anxiety, really that doesn't exist, everyone has that diagnosis. They aren't aware of the fact it's a separate thing, they don't believe social anxiety can be uncontrollable for anyone else. They need to be taught that the problem you have isn't anxiety but it's an illness which distorts your thoughts about social anxiety and it's no fault of your own. If they are legit friends they will start to believe you if you explain the illness properly.",0

My family doesn't understand the lack of motivation, constant fatigue and just the hopelessness that comes with the diseases, save one of my brothers. Most insist I work the job they want, go to college and take care of my mom. I went to a university after school and shared the same attendance problem that you do as well. I tell myself not to do it anymore and still I do.nnYou're not weak at all! We are just unfortunately dealing with a sickness that turns our minds against us. nnI recommend looking into new therapist (I know how tough it is to find a good one, I'm still looking) and do you take any medication? I find it's easier to get a prescription for an antidepressant through my doctor than a psychiatrist because they're usually booked far out. And some hospitals are awesome and give you the opportunity to make appointments online than over the phone (godsend!). I'm on Prozac, it's design for depression and anxiety, and while it hasn't helped all my symptoms and my anxiety is still linger, I can say I'm a lot more motivated and energized. It helps me actually get up and do. And I find myself actually looking people in the eyes when speaking. nnSomething I did before getting a job was volunteer at my town's humane society. It's something that looks good on resumes/applications and helping animals or even others - depending on where you volunteer - can really you make you feel satisfied. I remember sitting in a room full of cats who would come and snuggle with me and I could just talk about all my problems and I felt better. Like I had done something. It doesn't have to be animals you help with, I just know for me it was much easier than people. I noticed I was very active and involved in it and never missed a day because I enjoyed myself. And if your family is really insisting you get a job, look at third shift options (stocker, night auditor at a hotel) you usually don't encounter many customers/clients. Try to avoid cashier jobs if you can, those are the worse for anxiety.nnAlso, do you have any technical colleges or community colleges in your area? No offense to all the universities but most students are upper class or reserved in their own groups. Tech schools often have a variety of ages and people who like us, so maybe look into it. You need to a find a place where you're comfortable and enjoy yourself so your more incline to attend. nnAnd don't stress too much about the future. Focus on the today.

I too also have the wonderful combo of OCD and SA, its great fun isn't it. Around the age of 18 I started to beleive that I was the socially anxious person and did not want to change, by 19 I realized that it was effecting my life negatively and to be happy I needed to change. I wrote the below response for someone else but I think the same things apply at any level. Set goals that are achievable, even if they seem impossible and work towards them. I hope you go well. And don't rule out seeking proffessional help, I've found group Acceptance and Commitment therapy is excellent and accelarated my recovery.  nnn1. Forgive yourself for any past or future mistakes, beating yourself up won't get you anywhere. Focus on the next thing. n2. Think about your personal values and if social anxiety is limiting any of those (ex. honesty and telling someone what you really think or fun and leisure and avoiding to a party or a picnic) remember the be forgiving of youself as well if you stray frome these, values are on a compass. You want to set yourself in the right direction, you might stray or even fall off but its important that you keep going where you want to go. n3. Set yourself some goals, even if they seem impossible right now. Have some that are easy and short term(days to weeks), and some that are hard and long term (months to a year). n4. Start with the easiest goal. It can be really simple and make 3-6 steps to work yourself up to doing it and set a specific time, mine was 7.30pm to 8pm on fridays and saturdays at work. Mine was to insult a workmate (in jest and it was not my easiest goal just an example), the steps were:nn1) separate myself from the anxiety I visualized a hurricane next to me in my head with all my thoughts, fears and feelings. I then walk into the hurricane know exactly whats going to happen to me, not be suprised and overwhelmed but prepared and ready to experience the intense anxietynn2) imagine the situation itself along with the hurricane. Think about how it will go and feel any stress or anxiety that comes with it before going innn3) initiate a friendly conversation nn4) ask a more personal question nn5) make a light jokenn6) make a more personal jokenn7) jump in during group banter with funny insult(GOAL)nnMy values for this goal were connection and friendship. To connect more with my workmates to become better friends with them by gaining their respect in a banter session. nnAs you go along the steps tick each one off. Over time and after completing each step goals that seemed impossible will only be one or two steps away. nnThe feeling after you complete a goal is AMAZING  and you will want to keep going to the next goal after complting the first one, but it is very hard work. Connecting the goals with things that matter to you gives them more meaning and should motivate you more to do them. nnYou said you have an image of yourself as a super easy going and loud person. Think about the values that surround that and set up some goals. To start off with it could be as simple as asking someone for the time every tuesday, or looking somone in the eye for a second, then it could move to asking someone for directions, or initiating a comversation at school. A good end goal for you would probably be to find a boyfriend. nnIt seems inpossible now but if you set gradual goals and work towards them in a year or so you might find that its not actually that far away.  nnAlso it seems like in your school might be a bit hard to just break out and change completely. Maybe joining a casual sports club or society of some sort outside school would be beneficial so you could use it as a place to have a fresh start and work on these things. nnBasically it comes down to training yourself to grow the size of your comfort zone and in turn shrink your panic zone and to realize that sometimes the anxiety in social situations is a good thing, it shows that you care but that you also need to push through it to grow as a person. nnThink of your comfort zone like a bicep, you don't go straight into the gym and lift the heaviest weight on your first go. You start with the very light weights, and it grows a bit. Then gradually you move up the weight levels and the bicep keeps growing and growing, then one day you are lifting very heavy weights and laugh and wonder why you ever worried about trying to lift the 1kg weights.

So instead of always taking them and building up a tolerance I started taking when ever I need to do something that would usually make me anxious like talking to some person. The meds usually started working in about 15 mins so it was perfect plan. Did wonders for me. People noticed the difference in my behavior. Asked even me why I was happy ( but deep down I know they meant normal). And I know it's controversial but weed helped me so much as well. I had no access to it so I had to smoke with a couple of guys I know. Smoking it helped me relax and since I'm smoking it with a group of people it helped me socialize even more. And I also read a study that said weed helps shrink the Grey matter in brain. Apparently more than normal amount of Grey matter leads to symptoms like this so smoking it really helped a lot.

I think therapy could help you get these feelings off your chest, and maybe they could give you techniques on how to approach people. When I went to therapy, even if it was for only a couple of months, telling someone all my life problems was kind of relieving actually. nnJust tell yourself “you can do it” whenever you feel scared about doing something, that’s what I do: I talk to myself in third person (weird, but proven to give you confidence) and encourage myself; for example, if I don’t feel like going downstairs to the dining hall, I tell myself that everything is going to be okay, that I can do it, and that gives me strength to go down. You don’t need friends to lift you up: YOU need to lift yourself up, because the only one that can do that is you. No one else knows you like you do, you need to be your own best friend.

I did improve a lot, but I have not been to therapy in several years, and I have been meaning to make an appointment. I guess I can see if therapy helps me with this issue",1

It has helped me get a little better. I would advice you to maybe just try that. It’s gonna be awful at first but little by little it gets better. Also try medication or seeing a cognitive behavioral therapist in addition to that. If you can. As for your friend that you have feelings for, maybe ask her to hang out one on one in a place that you’re comfortable at. It doesn’t have to be a date but maybe see how that goes.

4288,"itzagoff","comment","","I grew up with an abusive father. He never physically abused me, but he threatened me a lot. I wasn't allowed to play with noisy toys. Batteries had to be taken out or it had to be turned off. I wasn't allowed to run around and talk loudly like a normal kid, it was just, ""Sit down and shut up."" nnOn top of that I used to watch him beat my mother over stupid little things. Cheese was crooked on his sandwich? He'd throw it at her and tell her to make another one. Walked across the floor wrong? He'd ask her if she was stupid. If she wore makeup? She was wearing ""whore paint."" If she didn't fold clothes or towels a certain way? He'd hit her. If he was just in a bad mood? He'd pull her by her hair and threaten to beat her ass if she didn't act right. He called her ""bitch"" more than he called her by her actual name.nn He broke whatever spirit I had before it was even fully formed. He scared me. I was afraid that he would treat me like he treated my mother one day. He was already halfway there. Now I can't look people in the eyes unless I know them. It's especially difficult for me to look at a strange man. If anyone plops a bag of groceries down or exhales heavily, I assume that I did something wrong and that they're mad at me, so I'll stay quiet and out of their sight to avoid possible conflict. I'm afraid to talk in social situations because I'm afraid I'll make myself look stupid and get ridiculed. I usually can't utter a word without a couple of drinks to help me chill the fuck out. If anyone reaches for my face suddenly, I flinch. It could be that they were trying to move hair out of my face or wiping something from my cheek or mouth. My dad used to do this thing where he would place his hand on my cheek and then slap his palm with his other hand, making me think that he was actually going to slap me. He got a kick out of it.nnI believe that he is the reason why my social anxiety is so bad. I'm 19 now, and it still feels like I'm in his presence even though I am completely safe. I have gone NC with him, and I'm going to therapy to try and reverse the effects that his abuse had on me. I feel hopeless because it feels like it'll never happen. Like I will never get over it and live life like a normal, social, happy person. I suppose it will just take a long time before I ever get to that point.nnMy mom divorced my dad when I was 5 and she is now married to an awesome lady, and I am living on my own now with my boyfriend of two years and we have a dog and a panther chameleon. Things are better now, but I have a long way to go. I will never forgive my father or forget the awful shit that he did. I often think about how confident and happy I would have been if he wasn't that way or if he wasn't a part of my life at all.nnIf you abuse your children, emotionally, sexually, or physically, you deserve whatever awful fucking shit that happens to you. You deserve to die. I said what I said and I'm not fucking sorry because people like you don't change, and they never will.",1

4290,"whymein","comment","","My social anxiety is more directed towards coworkers. So it's important to kinda consider what you are willing to work with and arent. My therapist had told me about considering a job where I can control when I do or dont want to talk. A job that allows you to practice when you want or can. Theres even degree ideas for people with social anxiety like computer programmers cause they're jobs that require minimal talking. For me, I enjoy doing Uber Eats where I'm from cause talking is minimal (especially with this pandemic going on, most people want you to just leave it at their door).  All I have to do is tell a worker at whatever restaurant "" I'm here for doordash for *insert doordash name*"" ""thank you"" and leave it at their door. If I do see the person all I say is ""have a good one"" and quickly get to my car (people really just care that their food is dropped off so they're really not judging like that). Next order! No need to talk to coworkers, I'm not worrying that I'm being judged. Just delivery and listening to music I genuinely enjoy. Sign up for delivery, be a dog Walker. Work at a library. I also work at the irs (tenprorarily) I like it there because they even have a policy in orientation to not judge people: to basically not judge and we all have our strengths and weakness, thus are equal. So far nobody has judged me like people do in more extroverted areas like restaurants (I recommened avoiding restaurants unless you feel it's something you can take on). At that job I'm also able to hang myself and not worry and I can talk to anyone and people are open. Some are mean but some people are gonna be mean. We just gotta learn how to handle it and that's ok too to make mistakes. nMy coworker actually told me about how two girls made fun of her hair: nMean chicks: *snickering* ""hey your hair a weave?"" nMy coworker: "" Nah this is natural. Why? Yours isnt?"" nnInside I'm like ""OOH BURNN, TELL THEM GIRLFRIEN"" nOutside I dont show emotion cause I feel I express stuff awkwardly sometimes. working on it though. nnI know its tough dude but I know you can make a badass comeback 👊 doesnt matter how worthless you think you are or what others make out of you. You can totally be a better and stronger you and there is people who understand us and will accept us for us. For me, a person who has social anxiety and has been depressed, has been talked about my coworkers and managers about being odd or something (or a loner or pushover) I've show my true colors to my fiance who had honestly made me feel most loved, even during times when I might've not been focused on him at all. During my ugly times we've pushed through the dark times and sometimes some people have to be their own hero. Cause even with my fiance I still have to do my part in loving myself. I also have a friend who's experiences SAD and shes accepted me despite not having ti hang out a lot. I met her at my old job. We were both quiet and she just so happened to have SAD too. Not everyone who is quiet is that way though. One dude was just naturally quiet but laid back and happy and mixed more with the coworkers that didnt like me. What's important is you out yourself first and make time to be a happier you. You're gonna fail. Yohre gonna take a step back after making progress sometimes. You're gonna cry. But it will be better for as lo g as you keep getting back up at some point",1
4291,"whymein","comment","","I have a hard time sometimes and I also will keep my head down or intentionally look the opposite direction. If I'm being hella honest with you, yeah I notice people do notice sometimes. I've sort of (but not fully. I still have days if self loathing and sadness) gotten use to the idea that people will talk about me or might be. For me, I learned from some other forum that to accept that people will judge. Even I might unintentionally do it but what helps about having SAD is you're a little more empathic, and that means I wont immediately make a judgment like many others would based on little, and truthfully I'm kinda thankful for that ability just cause I can only imagine if others felt how I did when I felt like crap. My opinion: I can only speak from my experience ( everyone's shyness or social anxiety varies from one another) practice when you feel ready. Everynow and then I'll look up quickly at their eyes. I'll act like I'm listening (sometimes I'm too nervous to listen cause I'm too focused trying to calm my anxiety) my eyebrows are raised and I set my lips to the side and pursed and make quick eye contact then look away while saying ""mhm"". It sorta gets me by. Eventually I'm working at getting better tonat listening but its gonna take a lot of baby steps and failing and even kinda embarrassing myself. nnI understand it's probably a lot hard than just to explain what you have to do. I'm not saying it's easy at all. I deadass fell backwards again last week crying when I git home cause I felt my coworkers didnt like me and expressed it secondhandedly. I got sucked into googling and self loathing that night. Even my therapist said I should consider a job better suited for me where I can control when I want to talk or not. (Its actually I got here 😬 oof) yeah you're gonna fail and youre gonna embaress yourself a little every now and then cause its impossible to not. It's only human! nnAs for eye contact, if a person notices, for me it helps to remind myself things such as ""ok but is this gonna matter to them when they friggin die? Are they really gonna be like ""fuck that weired quiet ass chick"" 😂 cause if someone did, thatd be a sad way to die. Nah it shouldnt matter. And dont forget everybody comes from different places. Some people could have like Bipolar Disorder. Some people are narcissistic, or psychopaths. Some people have no remorse. You gotta make it a goal to protect yourself and stand your ground! Reach out, get advice. Learn it's ok to fail and that it's a necessary lifestyle to get back up and try again. Even if it means you're crying on the ground a little or even a lot, just as long as you get back up eventually. Eventually you get thicker skin if you continue to work on it. Give yourself a shit at life. And often a person who needs to judge, it's more about them,  not you. What they're doing is reflecting themselves when they judge. Forget about them. Why be friends with people who dont know any better? nnSorry for the huge rant but hope this helps somehow",1

4300,"FaTaL9597","comment","","Sorry in advance for the really long response.nnGlad you are able to make that progress, it's further than I can push myself to get. The people I talk to are very limited. I have 2-3 friends from high school I still talk to regularly, and I can talk to them with little to no feelings of anxiety. The only exception to that would be if it's a topic I am not too comfortable on, but that doesn't happen much because, in all honesty, we don't have serious conversations that often. I've also known them since 7th grade(12-13 years old) and I am now a Junior in college(20 years old), so I am rather comfortable.nnI also have a handful of friends from college, only from the men's lacrosse team because I play lacrosse with them and so talking with them was kind of a given. I definitely interact with them more than I interacted with the guys on my lacrosse team in high school, none of which I am in contact with anymore. I attribute this to the fact that most of us live on campus so we are closer and are able to spend more time together whereas in high school the only time I saw most of them was at lacrosse or passing in the halls. nnIn all honesty, I don't know if I had anxiety before college or if I just never knew it was anxiety because I only really learned about mental illnesses(ie. depression, anxiety, etc) until my second semester of high school. That is a very convoluted and unhappy story which I won't go into, however, but ever since then I have felt slightly broken. I don't know if this sort of triggered anxiety in me or if I was always anxious and just now realized it and could put a word to it.nnI know as a child (younger than 10) I went to a counselor/therapist, but that was for behavioral issues which I may at some point make another post on somewhere else. I have since been to 2 counselors at my college, the first of which I didn't really go to for myself, but the counselor was kind of worried about me. I brushed it off at the time. The second one I went to and tried to get advice for social anxiety but it didn't help me at all because I couldn't get myself to follow her instructions. She gave me an ""assignment"" to sit next to someone in one of my classes and try to introduce myself. I didn't do it. I couldn't get myself to go sit next to someone, so I sat in the back of the class by myself.nnThis counselor said she could not diagnose me, but believes I have \[social\] anxiety and possibly depression and should go to a therapist and get tested and diagnosed. I have yet to do this either because I don't want to tell my parents. This comes again from the anxiety. It's not that I don't trust them to support me and help me, but just the anxiety of telling anyone I know really terrifies me and even if I have a plan to tell someone, I oftentimes just can't get the words out.nnThat is another reason I don't talk much. Asides from struggling to talk in the first place, if I do talk, I am often very awkward and mess up my thoughts as I speak which makes me not want to speak at all. I also tend to think about conversations long after they occur and have thoughts of how I should have phrased something differently or not have said it at all and this basically psyches me out of talking even more.nnAgain, sorry for such a long reply, this is basically the only place I can actually let it out and phrase my sentences correctly. I will never understand why online is easier.",0

I really wanted to fight my anxiety and be more independent, especially since I knew I wasn't going to be able to afford college otherwise, so I joined co-op instead of taking AP and Honors classes like I usually did. Most of the students in co-op got put into office jobs, but my teacher put me in a grocery store to make minimum wage. She said they hired a lot of people with ""problems"" so she felt I'd do well there. In retrospect she probably hated me haha. nnIt was really nerve-wracking at first, but I went to the interview and basically got hired on the spot. It was less professional than I thought it'd be. My training days were scary. I was making a lot of effort to be friendly and not look nervous, but everyone had the impression of me as being a really nervous person anyways, and things were awkward. One of my bosses even called someone over to train me by saying, ""this is puchirin, she's reallyyyy nervous, and it's her first day. can you show her the registers?""nnThis was nearly three years ago, and I'm still working there. I've definitely gotten over my fear of public transport, running errands, making phone calls, and approaching strangers at stores. Since I used to be a near shut-in, that's been a huge improvement! I can order my own food and make my own appointments now which is awesome! But honestly I think I really lucked out. I'm not friends with any of my coworkers, I'm too scared to say hi to them, and they all seem uncomfortable with me when we have to work together. Some of the regular customers point out how quiet I am, and if our store wasn't unionized I think I would've been fired for my SAD ages ago. I guess I can't be too bad if they've kept me on so long with such good hours. I always come in on time, rarely call out, and I'm very nice and polite with everyone. So i only ever get in trouble for doing things wrong or not being firm with customers.nnOverall I'm glad I have a job, even if it's a shitty one. It gives me purpose every day, and it really helped me deal with strangers. It can be draining, and customers and coworkers can be so mean and scary. But overall people are so much nicer and mature than the people you'd find at school, and most of the time they'll have basic respect for you so that the job gets done. nnI'm very thankful for everyone's patience. I wish I could've done more for them and made a better impression, but I guess it can't be helped with my anxiety being as bad as it is. But it could be worse right? I've saved a lot of money for school during my time here, and i was able to afford brief therapy, so I hope I can finish school and get a better job, where hopefully I can do a lot better next time. I would definitely recommend retail if you're looking to get out of your shell a bit.

4516,"Deekkru","comment","","I'm going to run the risk of sounding dismissive, and suggest looking into seeing a good therapist who specializes in social anxiety.nnI don't say this to pass you off to someone else (feel like I should say this bc it's something I'd worry about, tbh), but because I think the long-term support could make a world of difference. After the peak of my social anxiety, when I was going back out into public and had to face how terrifying it all was, getting that support and direction on a weekly basis really really helped. My therapist got to know me, learning what was scariest and what I was motivated by, and set tasks that were difficult but ultimately achievable. He got me from only leaving my home to attend college classes to a point where I was: speaking up when ordering at coffee shops, not panicking over grocery shopping, reaching out to greet new classmates, no longer cowering every time someone noticed me in public, etc. I had to move away after awhile, but I still credit him with getting me far enough along that I can guide myself now using the tools he taught me. 100% would recommend hunting down a good therapist.nnHowever, if you don't have the time/money for that, here's my top suggestions:nn1. Practice mindfulness. Be aware of your behavior, and make a running list of what you did/how it negatively affected you. Later on, look back at the negative thoughts/actions and find something new you can do instead. You're aiming to recognize that behavior now so you can gently correct it *as it happens*. (Bonus tip: always replace with a new action/thought instead of just stopping something cold turkey. Bad always needs a good to take its place.) Examples of actions and replacements: Beating myself up over a choice -&gt; Acknowledge that it happened instead of fighting it, and encourage myself with ways I can improve. Telling myself ""I'll look foolish if I ask a question"" -&gt; Firmly remind myself ""I am going to ask this question today"", and instead focus on how I can word that question clearly so that it's easier for them to understand me (satisfies my need to people-please, thereby letting me focus more on actually asking the question).n2. Set tasks that require effort, but are achievable with practice. A personal example comes from my therapist, who knew that I struggled to shop alone in grocery stores because the big crowds and one-on-one interaction with a cashier made me nervous. He knew I loved caffeine, and that my aunt (who drove me to my appointments) was buying me coffee every week. My task was to tell her ""thank you but no"", and then buy it myself at a small coffeeshop near his office. This was difficult because I was alone and had to speak to a cashier, but achievable because I was motivated by the desire for coffee and could use the small, empty coffeeshop as practice for bigger, busier stores. Basically, look for your scariest end goal (like walking up to a higher ranked physician in another department and directly asking your question), and keep stepping it down until it meets that ""scary but doable"" mark. Maybe that means making notes about them so you can remember personal information and feel more confident during small talk, leading to more familiarity overall. Or maybe it means asking smaller questions to more familiar people more often, so that questions in general are less daunting.nnThis post got SUPER long, but I hope it was in some way helpful. And you are more than welcome to chat with me anytime about anything. I am sometimes slow to respond and kind of awkward with wording (I don't sleep much), but I'll always listen. :)",1

4522,"puchirin","comment","","Exposure types of things also brought the same reaction in me. Mostly my issue is speaking at all, so whenever I tried to talk (even a few words) either people wouldn't pay attention to me, stare at me, or make fun of me by saying things like ""oh you can talk! you're not mute!"" Of course those seemingly big grand attempts will trigger your anxiety to go into overdrive, because you have one (unrealistic) expectation for a situation, but it goes a different way. I don't think exposure works unless very careful CBT is done. Remember it's not all about you. Other people have preconceived notions about you already. So of course they're surprised and confused if you go from looking really anxious to suddenly being very overactive and talkative. They'll also remember the loud weird thing you did more, because you tend to do quieter weird things, and that's what they expect from you. Normal people have tons of cringe moments, but others don't care to point them out much because they have plenty of normal memories of them in addition to the cringey ones. They might also expect them to be cringey.nnCBT isn't just lying to yourself. I think it's more about identifying productive thoughts vs. unproductive thoughts. People are judging you and they do care what you say. But in a lot of cases, there's no evidence that *everyone* in the room is judging us and taking precious time out of their day to diligently discuss how poorly we act, and how badly they want us to fail/be fired/go away/etc because of how weird you are. They think about it for a moment and move on, because you *really* don't matter to them unless you're their boss or lover or something. And someone yawning while you talk or making a strange expression isn't indictative of a permanent, unchanging perception of you. Normal adults know that it's normal to change and that people are complex. This is all-or-nothing thinking. Literally no one cares about you enough to think ""they're the weirdest person in the whole world and nothing could ever change my opinion of that."" They most likely just find you strange, and maybe very strange, but they also have various other opinions about you, positive or negative, and are open to anything you might change about yourself. They are subject to change, just like you.nnDon't focus on exposure to the big stuff that scares you (direct social interaction). If it's difficult for you to even use public restrooms or say hi to a coworker, then you have to work on those little things and then head to the big stuff, or else you'll always be disappointed with how things go. When I was doing CBT, my therapist suggested things like standing in the hallway of a club room, then actually going inside the room, and *then* I could eventually work up to joining the club. In each step you do the CBT, and it'll go a lot better because those baby steps are highly unlikely to go terribly wrong. You'll also notice how genuinely irrational your thoughts are. Then when you get to the big steps, it's harder to fall back on the old thinking since you'd have resilience and experience already. You'll also know for sure by then that a worst case scenario does not have to be handled with a worst case reaction.nnSo overall, exposure therapy is not worth it if you're not prepared for it. But remember everyone does really cringey stuff. Any normal person has a whole inventory of cringe moments that they replay to themselves at night. Of course most if them won't bring it up, because theyre also worried that you might remember, and theyre embarrassed about how they acted. At least your cringe stuff isn't recorded, and you're not famous and stuff. Those are probably the only times where a cringe moment would have the potential to actually ruin your life and reputation forever.",1

Why? Because of allll those damn worries in my head. There’s no way I could’ve talked and dated a boy in high school either. I have a fear I’ll be to awkward, boring, you name it. nnNow, I hear you, and have no idea what your situation or relationship to your family is. But please tell someone about what you’re going through. For me, I started by telling my older brother, and he helped me build up the courage to ask my mom to get help. And we did. But if you truly want to get better, you have to build up the courage to just let it all out to someone who can help you. It might not be that easy for you to get help, but I’m actually asking you to Please get help for yourself. Why live life in fear and worries when you have an opportunity to overcome it? Anxiety is a bully. But here’s how I got better, and still getting better. And hopefully you can kick anxiety in the ass like me and SO many other successful people with social anxiety.nnWhen I told my mom, she was reluctant at first. She honestly kept trying to make excuses to deny that it might just be shyness, and honestly I just said, “just please take me” for like the 50th time I’m not sure😂And finally my mom took me to the doctor. When the doctor asked me questions, I let it ALL out to the point where I teared up. And you know what, it felt like the best thing in the world. I was finally going to start kicking anxiety’s ass. And I was SO NERVOUS before my appointment and worried about everything. But it was all in my head and the appointment goes very well and it’s sooo easy. They are trained to make you feel comfortable. nnAfter the appointment was done, I was prescribed Prozac. And I started with a baby dose of 10 mg. For some reason I was extremely scared to take any sort of pill for my social anxiety, because... Yeah all those worries you probably get me😂. Anyway, when I started taking the pill, no side effects even happened at all like I worried about. And right now I’m taking a 40 mg and still no side effects. :) I’m also doing exposure therapy, which sounds tiring and uncomfortable, but WORTH IT... I told myself if you wanna kick anxiety’s ass, you gotta suck it up and just do it. Moral of the story is try to hype yourself up if you start to get nervous😂nnSorry for this VERY long ramble, but I wanted to tell you some of the things that I’ve overcome because I got help. 1. I was able to actually email and call a grocery store to get a job. I was so nervous, but none of the things I was worried about even happened. 2. I’m actually texting with a guy I like. Who would’ve thought?? I would have never been able to do that before and it’s all your anxiety that makes you think your worthless at anything. 3. I can finally start more conversations when I’m at the dinner table and sound more confident. nnOverall, it’s HUGE what getting help can do for you. That’s why it’s there, so people like you and me don’t have to deal with the bully of social anxiety. And the first step to kicking anxiety in the ass, is to tell someone. Just do it... hype yourself up, ignore those anxious thoughts, and just let it all out to your mom. It will be SOOO 100% worth it in the end. I promise. nnAnd if you ever need to talk, ask questions, etc. you can ALWAYS message me whenever, and I’ll be more than happy to help you. :) You got this!! I truly believe in you.

4531,"puchirin","comment","","Some therapists don't like to give ""labels"" and instead focus on treating the symptoms, so your therapist might not have even thought about it much. Other therapists will tell you during the intake session that they suspect you have so-and-so. I think in some states of the USA though, only psychologists, nurse practicioners, and psychiatrists (i.e. masters-level clinicians) can give a diagnosis.nnDoes your insurance require that mental health providers create a treatment plan or provide a diagnosis before they will pay out? You can check the posts that therapists make about insurance and payments on subs like r/psychotherapy, and see if your insurance is mentioned anywhere. You can also ask your insurance provider directly. If you have an insurance like this, your therapist probably has something about your condition already.nnIf none of the above work, you can always ask your therapist directly. Just say that it is important to you, and that you'd like to know more details about how he plans to help you. My therapists never said anything directly about a diagnosis but they would agree that I have ""symptoms."" It's best to ask if this is something important to you.",1

But I was under intense emotional pressure that I just blurted everything out and broke down. Bad timing because of this entire pandemic. I haven’t talked to anybody at school because I don’t think they’d care much. I know they’re my school counselor but they probably have better things to do than deal with me.

4627,"dhavvy","comment","","Yup. 18 year old here, graduated this year, also feel like I wasted my school years being anxious about everything. I was even valedictorian and managed to give a speech without having an attack? But I never went to parties, barely hung out with my few friends, etc. Now I’m having to look for a job and practically have a panic attack every time I think too deeply about it. Crazy how we are all relating to this lol. Kind of helps me because I swear everyone around me is already working 3 jobs, enrolled in college, getting engaged, something. I don’t necessarily want to be loud and outgoing, but I do want to stop being absolutely terrified of everything in existence. What’s helped me a little is an internet friend that I’ve become very close to. If you have a close enough friend, or someone older in a position that could speak to you (a parent, a therapist) I think you’d benefit from it, honestly. My friend is a very outgoing, extroverted person and he likes to try and help me be more social and open. Seems like you’d like someone to do that since you want to be more out there.",0
4628,"balou_era","comment","","Well in that time I was already in treatment for SA so no, I only got tested for autism. Also I think what really 'proves' it is the fact that social interactions get worse over time, the more you get soaked into this illness. At times I was too scared to go to the bakery bc I saw too many people standing there. That wasn't a problem a few years before. For me that is one sign to know I should work against it.

4670,"BigDog622","comment","","I am 22, and I can completely relate. You shared your story, so I’ll share a bit of mine. I hope that you can find some comfort in it. nnWhen I was in my senior year of high school, I was so sick of all the work that went towards picking out a college. So I took one visit to the college I ended up choosing, and I was like, “Yeah, I like it well enough, I’ll just go here.” But I wasn’t really sure about my decision, and because of my anxiety I was miserable for much of the time that I spent there. So, when I was around 20, I decided to take time off from school, and find a job. Only my job experience wasn’t in retail like yours, I was a tennis pro at a tennis club. As you might imagine, that was a very stressful time for me. I, as a person with social anxiety, was trying to prove myself (mostly because I was so young compared to my coworkers) and a lot of days were very stressful. It started out as something of an internship. I worked the first month or so without pay, but I eventually proved that I was a capable enough pro and started to get paid. The pay was pretty good, and in many cases I was able to overcome my anxiety and I met some wonderful people and had some really fun nights coaching and helping run tournaments and events. But after about 6 months, I started to really get anxious again, and it started to become where every day was a struggle, mostly just due to social interactions. I felt the urge to explore going back to school again. And two months later, I decided that that was exactly what I wanted to do. And I have been successful in junior college, and now I’m planning on transferring to a four-year university once again starting in 2021. And I feel much more happy and confident about it this time around because I had that break. nnI tell you all of this because I read your post and it really seems to me that you are at a similar point that I was in my life just three years ago. I know that you said that you think you are using going back to school as an excuse to leave your retail job, but I believe that you should really consider that possibility. Also, my friend, realize this: it is perfectly okay to take time off if you really need it to figure out what in the world you’re going to do! I wish someone told me that when I was in a similar situation to yourself. I feel as though society pushes the narrative that as an 18/19 year old kid that you have to have everything together and have your life all planned out, but the reality is it doesn’t work that way. I have learned in my short time on this earth that we basically are going to spend our entire lives figuring things out. And I don’t think you should worry about “mooching” off your parents either. Hopefully, your parents love you, and they signed up for this when they had you. It’s their job to help you, and that includes monetarily. So just do your best to relax about that. And my friend, I hated hearing this just a few years ago when I was your age: but you are just 19. Don’t be afraid to take some time off, and my advice would be to really appreciate the “basics” in life again, especially your relationships with family and friends. Count your blessings, and see where you can improve. Push yourself out of your comfort zone as often as you can. I’ve learned that that is the best way to overcome SA. And definitely, definitely consider seeing a psychiatrist and getting on medication. I’m on medication, and I can assure you that it really helps once you find the right meds, and you could also perhaps consider coupling the meds with regular visits with a psychologist or social worker. Try your best to do all of these things, and then consider going back to school or work. Sorry, I know that this post is a bit long, but I wanted to give you as much as I can, because trust me, I’ve been in a similar situation. I hope this helps you! :)",1

Like are you able to go shopping, make a doctor's appt, etc. If that stuff is still too hard, def try those ""baby steps"" first so that you feel more confident about putting out applications. Usually retail/UPS/FedEx/Amazon/doctor's offices are where young people your age first start working. Start with making a resume, though honestly some places like Amazon don't even require a one! nnI also have severe SA and I started working at a grocery store when I turned 18. It's been almost 3 years and I'm still there. It's been hard and shitty at times, but it's seriously so worth it. At least do it for the money lol making money is awesome! nnAll it takes is just looking up stores in your area and putting in an online application. Try to avoid fancy household names and fashion stores since those kinds of stores tend to have actual standards for their employees. Walmart and other random grocery stores (besides Trader Joes and Whole Foods) are usually not picky and it's very easy work. Fast food and fashion can be easy depending on the chain, but def get the vibe of the employees first. Some chains have terrible turnover and it shows if every employee is just super rude and miserable. Decent places will have generally normal, polite employees.nnIf you want some practice, you can try calling some places and asking them directly if theyre hiring. Trust me only maniacs would respond rudely to that question! If anything they'd just say ""we arent hiring right now""/""call again when the managers here""/""its all online."" If they say theyre hiring, ask how you can apply and any next steps that they recommend. Usually calling and following up on an application can show interest. I know my boss sometimes doesn't look at apps until she gets called about it. If you go in person and make sure to look nice and friendly, it'll be even better. You can get a sense of the vibe of the employees and maybe some useful tips and advice from them.nnIn low-wage jobs honestly the interviews are rarely as high-stakes as the internet makes you believe. Mine was literally just getting my papers in and picking my hours. Just be positive, be clean, act normal, and don't say that you hate customers or have problems with being late. Definitely don't mention shyness or other personal issues. nnIt's really so much easier than it sounds! And once you get the job it really just becomes a routine like any other. It's totally worth trying and you'll probably improve your SA a ton if you take the plunge and see what happens!",0

4749,"puchirin","comment","","Usually this kinda thinking is fortune-telling, which is a cognitive distortion. Your anxiety is trying to predict the future so that you can be protected. But actually you can't predict the future, and the behaviors that you do in response to the ""fortune"" -- such as avoiding people, not talking about yourself, etc -- are super unproductive. Not only do they cause you stress, but you might start to act weird because of that stress. So then others start to react as negatively as you anticipate, which causes you to overgeneralize and assume all social situations will go that badly, all because of *one* bad instance with *one* person where you were consumed by *one* unproductive thought. That's the cycle that cognitive distortions put us under.nnWhen you catch yourself thinking this way, try to think of a more reasonable outcome. You already know that this thinking is irrational. But thinking that people will ever respond with things like ""what the hell is wrong with you"" is also irrational. Think about it. What kind of normal person responds to someone's music taste like that? In a more realistic worst case scenario, someone might say ""woah. never heard of them. sounds weird"" and end the conversation. They might completely forget about your tastes in a week, or month, or year. Overall, it's an awkward moment but it doesn't matter to either of you. Best case scenario, the other person is like ""ive never heard of them. But maybe you know this other band?"" and it might be something you both like, and you'd have just made a friend :) And if someone does say a super rude thing to you, does it really matter if you have their approval or not? Because they're clearly not even capable of basic respect, you can be sure that they'd treat a ""normal"" person with ""nornal"" tastes in that same way. It'll be out of your hands.nnCBT worksheets and exercises are really helpful with identifying these thoughts and working through them. Ultimately you'll always have these kinda thoughts, because everyone does. It's what keeps us from doing really reckless things. The difference is that CBT helps us accept and manage them in the same sort way that ""normal"" people do. So we will start to express ourselves in spite of those thoughts, and stop dwelling on them so much that we get depressed. nnI also recommend just writing these thoughts down in your phone's notes app or something. Write them in all their gritty ridiculous detail. Come back to read them in a day and try to see which cognitive distortions you're falling into and look up ways to combat them. Personally I find CBT wayyy easier with a therapist who can tell me when I'm being irrational, but it's always worthwhile to practice on your own. nnRemember its not about pushing them out of your head, it's about dealing with them healthily!",1

All my life I was that girl who doesn't really talk. I don't think there is one situation that made me like that. I just feel like I was always like that but each year it's been getting worse. nIn elementary school I had to do a lot of presentations. I was a punching bag for teachers. They really hated that I was talking quietly, not participating and just wanted to make me feel bad about myself, like I was less than everyone else.I was forced to talk till I cried uncountable times. I started to self harm because the pressure was just too much to handle. The only thing that helped me during that time were my friends. I was friendly almost with everyone at my class because I have known them for the whole 9+ years. They knew how scared I was and they accepted me and they were the only reason why I didn't hate going there. I could be myself only with some of them. One of the teachers thought I was just faking anxiety because I act like a different person when I'm with people I trust. That hurt me so much because I don't fake it! I'm just scared of you judging me and making fun of me.nThen I started High School which was a nightmare. I wasn't used to meeting new people. I was with the same ones for my whole life and these people didn't know about my problems. I was so scared that I developed an eating disorder and my self esteem is so low. I'm starting my last year in a few days and I know that I'll get bad again. My health has been so great most of the times I was in quarantine. I didn't have to see anyone, go anywhere, life just stopped and I was so relieved. I don't have any friends at school. Whenever someone tried to speak to me I either froze or I just talked about basic stuff because I don't trust anyone enough to tell him my actual thoughts or opinions.nI do try to challenge myself once in a while but there is just so much that I still can't do. I was able to go to two concerts by myself (which ended up being the best times of my life), I can shop in a specific supermarket by myself, I can take a bus or train, I was able to get a summer job last year which I never thought I could do. nBut I can't drive a car, bike, go literally anywhere new just like that. I'm scared of getting a different job, I don't hang out with anyone because I'm scared of judgement. I don't have life experiences like people around me do.

I couldn’t tell anyone either, because I knew that teachers were useless, and my parents believed in standing up for yourself. Which I did, but what are you supposed to do when it’s 10 on 1? Nobody helped me. nnI got really depressed. It was never diagnosed because I never really told anyone. I just acted happy when my parents were around. But I remember getting home, and sitting in the corner of the bathroom, holding the radio right next to my ears and tuning it to between stations so it just played white noise really loudly, and then just rocking back and forth while moaning for about an hour. That was the o my way I could calm myself down. n nIt’s been 4 years since it began. I’m in secondary school now, and I managed to get into a school that they didn’t, so I don’t see them anymore. nWell. To be honest, one of them goes to school with one of my oldest friends who I go swimming with. My old bully began feeding my friend lies and basically ruining my time at club too. But I clarified what actually happened, what that person is actually like, and it’s all good now. nnEven after all this time, I still don’t talk about it. Nobody knows except my sister, my best friend and the kid from swimming. It’s left a massive impact on me, as I’m constantly worried about the same thing happening again. nMy social anxiety came back in full swing after it, but it’s better now. nnI’ve learnt some tips, like, be confident. To be honest, I was bullied so much, I honestly don’t care anymore. nAlso, some of the popular kids at my new school tried something on me, as I was obviously the quiet nerd. I just went completely postal on them the first time, and now nobody tries to bully me. nI’ve also made it my mission to help those who are being bullied themselves. nI know how horrible it is, and I never want anybody to go through any of the pain I went got. nnI’m so sorry that you had to go through this too. I wish you, and everyone else all the best. nHave a great day. nn:)",0

4911,"tsumeeee","comment","","i totally get where you’re coming from with being afraid to ask for help, since i thought if i saw a therapist or psychologist it meant i was weird or people would see me as strange/troubled, but it really is all in our heads. i also think mental health is becoming less stigmatized, as more and more people are acknowledging its importance (especially during COVID), but you know there will always be people or communities who could judge. i’m not black, but my family is super traditional muslim and there’s a lot of expectations placed on me, which i’m guessing is kind of something you experience as well. however, it’s alright to be in tune with your feelings and want to seek help to manage those thoughts and emotions that come with social anxiety. other people in your life will just have to adjust, since you don’t owe them anything, and it’s really not that difficult to accept that you might struggle with certain aspects of your life. and just think, once you  see someone who works well with you, you will feel so much better and be able to manage your anxiety more!! :)",0

My bio always said something like ""just lonely af looking for someone to hangout with during covid."" It's crucial you learn to love yourself and enjoy your own company as well tho. Just be genuine and explore things that are interesting to you. Find other groups of people who are also into those things and go from there. One day after covid is over maybe start going to festivals and concerts (: therapy could help. I take beta blockers to stop the nervous sweating and shakes. Best of luck!",1

4989,"PlzzHelpMeRN","comment","","WTF i had to read this twice i thought it was my post, everything u said in your post resonates with me even down to the not feeling able to finish your degree. I finished my law degree a year ago, i got a 2:1. U can finish yours too, I promise you that. I nearly got kicked out in 2nd year when i failed a module because i didnt show for 2 exams (because i went home mentally ill on the uni counsellors advice, but didnt get a referral because i didnt get a doctors letter i needed as proof, but that was because the doctor wouldnt see me but gave me a anti depressants prescription without a diagnosis). I wasnt showing up for class because i wasnt taking in any of it, and i fell behind. This basically happened on all my modules though only this one i got extra fucked on. My assignments were due either every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks, my attendance was poor and when i did attend i basically had no idea what was going on. When lecturers asked me questions i was never able to answer, i cant hear and process long-winded questions at all, then think of an answer, and then say the answer, i jsut cant fucking do it it seems. Same problem for long-winded written exam questions. Im slow at understanding the questions, slow at thinking of an answer, and slow at putting it in words. I have to read questions and sentences over and over to like, process the words and then comprehend there meaning. Its fucked. I've been like this since school, atleast age 15, because i remember having a test for dyslexia back then, i never went back to ask for the results but id assume theyd have contacted me if i did have it (the test was done at school with the school counsellor woman). Back at gcse which is like age 15 and 16, id bury my head in the sand by playing games. It was an escape. Not because i was lazy as my mum still tells me i was now, but i couldnt do the work, i would take ages reading a single page, and none of it was going in and it would seriously infuriate me, i broke stuff because of it, smashed my laptop (which all my revsion was on, so a significant factor in why i did bad at school at 15 probably). People would give me revision techniques and none of them helped, but apparently i was just lazy. nnSo how did I finish my uni degree? Well basically the assignments were written starting about 2 days before hand in. Even though i always had 2 or 3 weeks to do them. I couldnt concentrate until literally the fear of failure forced me to do it and i did i sweating in a state of panick. Fuelled with red bull, and listening to airplane cabin white noise on youtube (it's the only way i can drown out the racing thoughts of my mind, and without the emotional stimualtion of music) and sad to say, post nut clarity. When i get stressed like that i guess the only way to destress and clear the mind is... you get the idea. My last assignment i had to do a moot court (basically a mock court hearing) and i had to take friggin propranolol so i could speak and stop my mind going blank (which always happens to me.)nnSooo i do wonder if I have ADHD or ADD, Ive never been to hyper, my brain is always in 7th gear, racing thoughts, but thats not seen in my personality really (apart from when i used to bite everyone when i was like 3) so I'd guess ADD, also wonder about auditory processing  disorder. I also dont know if this came first or the anxiety and depression. I feel like i started to hideaway and became more introverted due to not being able to get my work done from the learning issues and as i said games became an escape.nnVery interesting hearing how similar your story is, let us know how u get on. See i wanted a military engineering career but i couldnt get that with a diagnosis. On the other hand i dont feel like i could do the job because of these problems. I havent seemed to be able to find a fix to this issue in the last few years, no amount of excersize or eating better or drinking water, vitamin tablets, cbd, nothing seems to help. I think i should get a test for ADD, just gotta come to terms with not having the career i want lol",1

5055,"divinitywolf2","post","How do I overcome my SEVERE social anxiety/phobia?","I cannot remember exactly when my social anxiety/phobia began, but it was sometime in college. I am 24 now and nothing I have tried helps. I tried psychotherapy which involved delving into my past experiences with a psychologist and talking about recent happenings as well. I did this for almost two years with little results. Then I tried medication: Sertraline (Zoloft) and Escitalopram (Lexapro) at different times, but neither worked. Zoloft actually increased my anxiety and made me nauseous at the gym. Taking medication also scared me a bit because I don't like feeling I am not in control. I have tried cognitive behavioral therapy as well, but it did not work because I could not push myself to do the exposures and get outside my comfort zone. nnI am extremely uncomfortable around people I'm not familiar with. Besides my family, close childhood friends, and highly extroverted people, I tend to tense up and avoid almost everyone. I cannot focus at work most times because I sit next to a girl who fidgets a lot and it really gets to me. I feel like I am the reason she fidgets because I am making her uncomfortable and she can see how anxious I am. This makes it very difficult to get things done and I usually have to sit somewhere else to accomplish anything. nnWhat do I do? I hate living like this. My sister's boyfriend lives at our family's house now and I cannot even relax in my own home anymore. I got my own apartment for a few months, but it did not work out; the roommates were a married couple and a blind guy who were dirty and strange besides being 10 years older than me. I am also still paying off my student loans and car loan and this makes it difficult to find a decent new living situation within my small budget.nnIn order to socialize, I usually drink heavily with some of my old college friends and go out to the bars in the city. Sometimes the alcohol just makes my anxiety worse though. And I usually black out which sometimes gets me into trouble and ruins the next day entirely.nnI would love a girlfriend to talk to and be intimate with (which could also boost my confidence), but it is almost impossible with my fears. Tinder does not work because I'm not the best looking guy. I count myself lucky if I get one match in a week while my other friends get tons of matches. I'm also kind of short 5'8"" and awkward/quiet/boring, so even if I am able to muster the energy to talk to girls in person it usually just ends awkwardly and my self esteem goes down even more.nnWhat do I do?",1

The thought of being in a classroom terrifies me. ",1
5062,"xNovaz","post","Contemplating things.","nHopefully this makes sense here's my feelings.nnI really just need to vent all this shit out in my head. Social Anxiety. What a gift I'm gracious to be given. Every morning I dread to wake up of what you may ask?  All the things I feel and do in a day Awkwardness, Silence, Tiredness, Forced Interactions, Being Fake, and more. Not to mention the Suicidal thoughts of how I could just ease away my pains and everything will all be over. But I'm to pussy to do it. How I wish this will all just stop.nnLike I guess one of my biggest issue is my Energy level. Doesn't matter if I sleep at 9pm, 12pm, or 4 am I'm literally always tired. I guess it's just a side affect of the depression. So, if I'm in a uncomfortable situation usually at school I just ""Escape"" even if I'm not tired I force myself to sleep. Not really sure if that can relate to anyone but it's a really shit feeling. nnAnother thing that really bothers me is ""Normal People"" I can't say that I'm not jealous because I used to be a normal person myself. I think we all were. Looking back on my past I really wish I can just rewind. Like this condition is hell. I would never wish this upon anyone even the worst of the worst. I rather have cancer then this shit. Your body literally needs Social Interaction and this condition+others cock blocks you to the point you want to kill yourself from loneliness and depression. Really great.nAnother thing is people can sense right when you open your mouth if your worthy or not it's called First Impressions. You can kinda guess I fuck up all my interactions if any. But the worst feeling is when your actually trying your best to talk to someone and you know they have 0 interest in you or what your even saying. Like I have no words I rather you just fucking fake it to give me a boost of my confidence... like do people have hearts..  You Gave me another reason not to open my mouth. So, don't fucking ask why I'm quiet. nnAnother funny thing is that people don't even know what to do with us anymore so they're giving up on us people with SA if it's people in day to day life not giving a damn or the Scientists trying to figure out how to stop this from even happening in the first place instead of fixing people that already have it. Source: My Life+Post on Reddit about this.nnLike I have no clue how this even works. Your not born with social anxiety. Right? Well that's what I believe anyway. Idk but this seems pretty fucked up. You've never had SA in your life and then comes along some traumatic experience that gives you SA and Now it's Impossible rid of it but you can only ""Work on it to make it better""... So, your literally scarred for life wow who could've guessed. Everything just keeps getting better and better.nnSA literally affects all standpoints of life. Your School, Work, and Hobbies. Like for an example I used to love playing baseball I'm pretty sure I started when I was 8 and I usually was the best player on my team. I'm left handed so I would throw with my left but bat with my right. Which is pretty rare. I used to travel all the time with Travel teams during the weekends to go to tournaments. Up until hs where first year of hs tried out and tbh I was out of shape and I took a year off baseball beforehand. The whole tryout experience was so awkward I didn't talk to anyone even some to of my friends that were. Idk I guess I didn't talk to them because there were other people other than my friends and I wasn't comfortable with them I guess. And then Boom I didn't make it. That embarrassing experience made me quit baseball and bury it along with any other sports I used to play. So you can check off that club off the list to join. nnLike to this day I would really like to know what my trigger was for SA. I was a really outgoing popular kid back then. Everyone knew me I had like 2 friend groups 1 was the Sport Popular group and the other were just Cool/Nerdy I guess if you would describe them. Now I'm in the same group I've been in for years and everybody that ""Knew me"" now knows I'm the quiet person. Hell it kills me one of my best friends that went to a different group in hs I can't even talk to him now. I just say like ""Hey, What's going on?"" and then he responds "" Dude how's it going I never see you around anymore"". Then awkward silence comes in to SAVE THE DAY. nnI don't even know where to start to improve myself I feel like I'm in a constant loop. My mom loves me and supports me so much but it kills her and stresses her out so much that she can't help me. nAlso, thought I should add this in. I do go to the gym well I used to but I'm recovering from surgery right now. I do take meds getting new ones right now idk the name and Zoloft had no effect on me 75 mg. I did therapy for a bit but I felt like it was just a waste of money and I did feel good going and talking but I never did the tasks and I felt like it was a burden and I wasn't improving by just talking. I also have real bad acne on my back and little patches spread around on my face and neck. I really want to take acutane or whatever it's called but my mother won't let me have it because of her experience with it. nnRunning out of stuff to say. I guess that's good right. But finally one thing that I really have to get off my chest is My personality. I literally feel like I don't have one anymore. I feel like I can't make jokes or have a sense of humor. I don't know what I like anymore. I don't know if what I'm liking is just so I don't get judged by others. Like what sums this whole thing up is I just don't know. What is life. How can I live with this. The Anxiety. The Loneliness. The Depression. Life. And No it doesn't help to know that your going through the same thing. /endrantnn",1
5066,"kasigofs","post","I need all the help I can get to improve my social anxiety","*Introduction:*nI really need help to cure my social anxiety. If you have any tips for me, please leave them in the comments. This can just be things that make it a teeny bit easier.nI have already tried normal therapy, cognitive therapy and exposure therapy. It wouldn't be preferable to start using medications unless it is totally a last resort.nn  nIf you need any additional information, feel free to ask for it.nn  n**Background information:**n**(there is a TL;DR)**nI'm a 15-year-old guy who has struggled with social anxiety for about 6 years now. I was always shy as a child, but not until I reached 5th grade it turned into social anxiety. It wasn't that horrible in the beginning. I just dreaded attending family gatherings and having presentations in class. nMy anxiety was stagnant until I reached high school. I switched from a public school to a private school, because the public school didn't work for me, academically. It was fine for the first year of high school, not that many problems with my anxiety. But 15th of January in 9th grade everything went to shit. The previous semester I got perfect grades in a lot of school subjects. When Christmas break finally arrived I was incredibly exhausted from the amount of work I put into that semester. nI started skipping school, but that only lasted a few days until my teacher called my dad and told I'd been missing. I was skipping, not because of my social anxiety, but because of the high pressure from me academically. After my dad and I talked, I tried going back to school the day after. But as soon as I entered school my anxiety was going nuts. I went home again shortly after. nThe next week or two my dad drove me to school, trying to make me enter. I refused every time and it was almost hopeless. The next month or so, my dad drove me to school to drop me off at the school library where my teacher and I would talk for 15 minutes each day. We would talk about upcoming events at school, what the other students were learning that week, and some homework I could do at home. Basically, her just trying to make me join class again.nThen I flew over to Belgium to stay at my mom's house for 2 weeks. I would just join her to work every day. After that, there was a long period of time where I just stayed at home like it was a vacation. (Probably not so helpful, but my teacher and my dad were probably exhausted)nThe last weeks of the school year, I would meet my teacher at the public library. (In fear of meeting other students at the school library) There we would sit for an hour doing some school work. The final week of school I entered school again. The last week is so relaxed anyways. nDuring the school break, I got diagnosed with ADD. It seems a little late to get diagnosed in the final year of high school but better late than never.nFor my final year, I started school like usual. (almost) All the teachers had been informed of my anxiety and other diagnoses. Starting up, I would not have any homework and I would skip gym class. (other issues) They hired a new teacher that would help me specifically and I got a room in the building that I could hide away in if my anxiety got really bad. The month went fine. Then it crashed and burned. I went to school and locked myself in my private room. All day. Everyday. For the entire week. Today, Monday, I spent sitting in my room as well. I'm not doing any school work there and my social anxiety gets worse for each day I spend in there.nn**TL;DR:**nI'm 15. A guy. Social anxiety for 6 years.nI have also not been attending school an entire semester because of my anxiety and I doubt I can finish my final year of high school.nnn**Other diagnoses I have include:**n(I just thought it might help give you some insight into other things that can possibly worsen my social anxiety.)nn- High sensitivity (fairly common thing that makes you more sensitive to  smells, sounds, touching and sensitive emotionally)n- Depression (got diagnosed during my time away from school)n- ADD (I have started taking medicine, but a side effect I experienced was depression. This side effect is what made me lock myself in my room every day)nnA few other things I might add is that I am gay and closeted. I have severe body image issues. My parents are divorced and my mom moved to another country and started a new life. This could maybe have something to do with my anxiety.nnI did attend a recreational activity for 6 until I recently just quit it. (Theatre, strangely enough, I was comfortable performing on stage...)nnI just feel like my social anxiety is ruining my school experience. I have an IQ level above average (I was tested by a psychologist when I was 9. I'm not saying this to brag.) and I can't show my abilities in school work, where it actually matters, because of my anxiety and lack of concentration. (Due to ADD) If I somehow manage to get through high school, then I have no clue where to attend upper secondary school. (?)nAnd if I manage to get through that, I have no clue which job I'll pursue. I am creative, but not creative enough to manage my own company or something like that.nnEvery single person in my life is trying really hard to help me, and I feel bad for not improving my condition. Other people probably think I'm not trying. But I really am, it's just so difficult.nnnI think if I don't cure my social anxiety soon, I will completely fuck up my entire life, and it's extremely frightening to think about.nnnnPS: Please excuse if my English is a little sloppy sometimes, as it's not my first language.nnEDIT: Additional information:nI'm not suicidal, nor do I self-harm.nI have friends I visit occasionally.nI live in Norway.nn**EDIT:** Currently re-reading everything trying to figure out what I did wrong that made people ignore my post.

I had a group of people I belonged to but there was barely any more intimate conversations.nnMy life consisted of lectures, reading textbooks, playing video games and doing drugs to ease the pain of my lonely life.nnI couldn't bear it anymore and now I quit my studies. I'm currently at home with my parents and don't leave the house much. I'm lonley, depressed and increasingly anxious.nnI feel like I'm responsible for my situation because I didn't confront my anxiety enough. I took the easy way, which led me into this mess. It sucks ",1
5080,"IhateSA","post","Can someone tell me what is going on? My entire anxiety story.","nI'm 23 years old. I was diagnosed with anxiety about a year ago when I was 22. So I want to tell you guys what happened, what medicine I'm on and then I want you guys' advice. nnI have never had anxiety before. I was the team captain of my football team, I took a public speaking class in college. I was extremely nervous to go out on the field at the beginning of games and when I had speeches, but never encountered this type of anxiety. However, I noticed that I would get a bit shaky when speaking up in class especially if I would drink coffee and not have breakfast. I notice my neck would twitch. nnSo last year, I was gave a history presentation. I had coffee and no breakfast. I stood up in class gave my part of the presentation. During the presentation I got really nervous and just read what I had on my paper instead of actually giving a normal speech. Right after the speech was over I started feeling the blackout feeling kind of like someone has when they get up too fast. Scared that I would pass out, I just walked straight out of the class room. Sure enough right after I made it out of the door and closed it, I passed out. I felt better after passing out. I went back in the classroom. Was my regular self. The teacher fussed me but I told her I was feeling weak and went get some food. I was clowning around with other students after. No anxiety. This was on a wednesday.nnFast Forward to Friday. I have school again. Before the history class I have an economics exam. I'm running late to school. Just have the coffee, no breakfast again. Go through with the exam, feel good about it but quite hungry and a little shaky so i buy a candy bar out of the vending machine. I get to history class, people are doing presentations. I'm already done with mine from the previous day and no that I don't have to do anything but something just triggered me. I felt like I was about to pass out again. I put my head down until class is over, I still feel like I'm about to pass out, I'm panicking, so i walk fastly to vending maching and buy another candy, thinking that its my blood sugar or something. I eat it, I get some comfort for a second and start feeling it again, I go to the little store and buy a gatorade scared I could pass out at any minute. Extremely self conscious. I drink it, and head back for my car. As soon as I get to the car, I have my first panic attack, I'm laying down scared I'm having a heart attack. nnI get through it. I immediately go to the Dr. She thinks it could be something with food, tells me to focus on eating and drinking well over the weekend. I do that, but monday when its time to go back to school, I can't. I'm all panicky thinking that I must be sick. I'm having diarrhea etc. Tuesday I feel great at home. Wednesday when its time to go to school, all panicky having diarrhea again so I go straight back to the dr where she gives me an anxiety test. Sure enough everything on the test I'm thinking wow, this is exactly what I have. So she gives me .5 mg xanax as needed and celexa.nnI start taking my medicine. Xanax works like a charm. It’s the most relieving thing ever. I feel exactly how I did before I ever had anxiety. I took it only on school days or when I have to get up in front of class. So I take celexa for 4-5 months and it moderately helps. Learning of bad side effects of SSRIs though I decide not to take celexa anymore once my spring semester ends. I go through the summer and summer classes without taking any celexa or Xanax. My anxiety is heightened however, and I have to focus on breathing many times but I did it. I got through the whole summer without either drug. nIn August, I go to the dr because I have ear problems. She has to clean out my ears (it hurts) and I pass out. I tell her how I quit my meds and after passing out she tells me that I should consider getting back on them. As the fall semester approached, I got nervous and took my dr advice. I got back on the celexa. Man I felt great. Especially after about amonth on celexa. On a scale from 1-10 my anxiety was about 2 at max.  6 weeks into celexa I feel so great that I test my anxiety. On a bus that I was riding I decided that I was going to stand and give a girl my seat….. Bad decision. I begin to feel faint, start wobbling and shaking. I hurry and grab a Xanax as my vision is going black. It instantly saves me. I’m pouring down sweat. When I get to my destination, I try to explain to my gf what happened by my speech is slurred for about 5 min. nnAfter this episode my anxiety has been bad ever since. That leaves me to today. I’m on my celexa but my anxiety is very bad. I feel like I want to quit my anxiety meds. I felt great this past summer not being on it. It was challenging but I did it. I graduate in December and start working though and that makes me nervous. I don’t want to have anxiety everyday. I just wish I could go back in time before that history presentation to how I used to be. I’m not depressed, but it’s just extremely annoying how difficult everything is now. nnWhat advice do you guys give? Should I opt out of celexa? And just take Xanax as needed with a supplement? Or should I just stay on the celexa? Or should I wait until I start working to quit taking celexa? I have a supplement on hand called ""Genius Joy” It has B vitamins, D Sam-e 1000mg, 5HTP, and other stuff in it. Should I get off my celexa and try that? Comments on the entire situation would also be helpful! Thanks so much guys! n",1

5086,"PrimalColors","post","A little rant","I'm sorry if it turns out to be a little long but I haven't talked to really anyone about thisnnWhen I was young, I remember always being outgoing and extroverted. Now I'm extremely introverted and don't really go out of the house unless I'm with friends. I don't really know what caused it but when I was about 12 or 13 I started to develop bad social anxiety and it's only gotten worse over time. I'm 18 now. I can barely talk to people I don't know. If I know you well, I pretty much don't shut up, but if I don't know you I get more adrenaline talking to people than when I got in a car crash. Even with my parents I'm a completely different person around them than with my friends. I never tell them anything and I don't know why because they're loving parents. I never tell my friends anything either and they're all pretty understanding, but they never console me or really anyone for that matter. I can hardly make eye contact with people and I slur and stutter my words. I overthink every tiny thing I ever say for hours on end after I say it. I'm so petrified of being judged that I often miss out on amazing opportunities because I'm too scared to interact with people. It's so hard to meet new people. It's not that I don't want to meet people or go out, I really, really do. I have a group of around 5 good friends that I hang out with frequently and I can be crazy around and I'm happy with that. I still just wish I could be comfortable around new people like I am with my friends. I have a huge feeling of inadequacy constantly because all my peers seem to be so much better than me at everything and can meet people so much easier than me. I feel like I'm constantly in the shadows and it's mostly my fault. I've always been pretty smart. I took the hardest classes in school and got good grades, but all the other people in those classes are so much smarter than me and I feel like I don't belong there. I put so much pressure on myself to limits I know I can't handle just so I can have a feeling of adequacy. This terrible anxiety has caused me to be depressed for many years and I don't feel like I have the right to be. I have great parents. I've never been cold or hungry. Never had a traumatizing experience, but I'm still fucking depressed. In junior high I started to lie about the stupidest things just so people can like me more. I also started cutting myself (I don't anymore) and in all honesty it was probably just for attention. I switched to a different high school to escape my junior high past of all that lying because I didn't want to lie anymore. I also started going to therapy with little to no results after over a year. Idiotically, I turned to drugs and alcohol as a result of this anxiety and depression. I always get higher and higher every time I smoke and I drink way too much every time there's alcohol. I recently took LSD for the first time and I took way, way too much and had the worst experience of my life. I won't get into the details of the trip, but it was fucking horrifying. It made me really reflect on my life. I feel like the only reason I'm doing these things was because I can't talk to people. I've had a few good relationships but my anxiety and depression pushed them away and another girlfriend cheated on me which even furthered it. There have been countless times where I have had something to say or had the chance to go out and do something but I don't because I'm too afraid to say it. Even when my friends ask to hang out I almost say no because I'm afraid they're doing out of pity but I go anyway so I don't have to stay inside all the time. I'm always the butt of every joke and have a constant bombardment of ""playful"" insults which makes me feel like they don't like me. I just take it and take it because I'm too scared to stand up for myself because I fear I'll be seen as rude. This is gonna sound super edgy and it probably is, but I'm sick of it. I'm sick of feeling of constant worthlessness and not being able to talk to people. I just want to be able to talk to people without having all the awful symptoms that social anxiety brings. I don't want to be depressed anymore because of my anxiety because I have a good life and I feel I have no right to be sad. I go out of my way sometimes to ask people the time, ask where something is in a store, meditate, YouTube videos, and nothing has worked. I'm constantly changing myself to try to fit in with a certain crowd but I'm always feeling disappointed in myself. I'm sick of putting all this pressure on myself and never feeling satisfied. I crave emotional intimacy so much because I feel like that's the only thing that makes me happy. I don't care about sexual stuff but I long for relationships and intimacy with people, but every time I get in one I fuck it up with my anxiety and it's a lot for people to deal with and I make the same mistakes every time. I'm sorry this has been really long and its all been so fragmented haha. But thank you if you've read this I don't have really anyone to talk to about it",1

No, I have wasted it.","I'm 16 and I've never had any real friends, and whenever I was starting to develop friendships with people my anxiety would shut that down instantly and make it incredibly difficult for me to talk to them.nnI stopped going to school at age 13 because of my anxiety, I was constantly getting panic attacks and cold sweats, I couldn't focus on my work and everything scared me. This got my parents into a lot of legal trouble, and it seriously hurt my relationship with them, but I couldn't take school anymore, it was way too much and I wanted to do anything but school.nnI wish I could go to school without anxiety, I love talking to people and being with people I love, but my anxiety won't let me, all I can do is fantasize about that.nnI'm at the point where I've lost all hope, I feel as if nothing will ever change. My daily routine is just me dicking around online and I'm sick of it, it's so boring, but I have nothing else to do. My anxiety is everywhere, I can't get rid of it no matter how hard I try.nnI've talked about this with my psychologist (I think that's what they're called? The mental health version of a GP) but I find it really hard to talk about any of my problems there, they just run down a list of questions then end it.nn ''have you had any bad or suicidal thoughts lately? How have you been? So no changes? OK, see you next month''. It's pretty much that, I don't really have a chance to say what I want because I'm getting rushed to finish. I've mentioned smaller thing like ADHD and stuff but he didn't really help me with that much. So I don't see asking for help as much of an option, I also don't want my parents to find too much out about myself because it would probably worsen our relationship more.nnWhat is there to do anymore, I don't feel like there's anything I can do now, I have no control. I don't want to keep living like this, it's so boring and my emotions have gone numb. I seriously don't want to wake up tomorrow to do the same thing I've done yesterday, I'm so sick of it...nnIf I told my doctor any of this, he'd have to tell my parents, if my parents found out I'm depressed and suicidal and have crippling anxiety they'd treat me with even less respect than they do now, I'm considered a failure, and I agree that I am one, I just don't want them to have more reason to tell me how much I fucked up my life and how ill never have another chance in life. I already know.nnThis has been a really sad post, sorry about that, just wanted to vent a bit. I'm usually a lot more happier sounding. nnThanks for reading. ",1
5094,"NyanShadow777","post","I have social anxiety, am anti-social, have ADD, have high self confidence, and am probably a sociopath?","I'm curious of what other people think of me. nnOn the outside I'm a shy, quiet, socially awkward and boyish looking 17 year old. Yet I have high self confidence, am anti-social, and have many traits that a sociopath would have. When I meet new people, I focus on my voice, how childish and soft spoken I sound. I am unsure of what to say, what facial expression to make, how to act. I look like a little kid, coordination disorder makes me sometimes position myself oddly, I can't problem solve with creativity which may sometimes make me appear dumb. I have ADD, but the kind where you hyper focus. I'm too good at paying attention to one thing, and it makes me narrow minded in situations with obvious solutions. It often makes me appear less intelligent then I actually am. I'm 5'11 and 115 pounds, my left eyelash turned white, my face is a bit discolored, my jaw is too large, my hair is probably messy, I need braces. Am I breathing enough, is my face red? I hope they don't notice. I always forget to smile, I may seem cold. I know if anything goes wrong, they'll feel just as embarrassed as I do. Do they think that I'm cold and mean? What if I come off as weird? It will be over soon, why do I care what they think?nnIn social situations I'm too critical of myself and can't relax. It's difficult for me to make the right facial expressions, talk, and worry about my other negative traits that could ruin the interaction or the person's image of me. My insecurities can distract me and make me feel more nervous. When I'm comfortable and unintimidated of the person I'm talking to, I'm a different person. However, that doesn't make everything perfect.nnI don't really have a real personality. I have little to no empathy for anyone I don't know (I have some empathy for those I care about most), I'm not emotional, nothing anyone says hurts my feelings, I can easily lie no matter how terrible it is without feeling guilt. As a child until middle school, I liked to torture small lizards. I wanted to buy a cat as an adult and torture it. However, I realized it was quite wrong and that part of me is disturbing. I came from being a very emotional child to who I am gradually. I am virtually the same if you compare me to who I was a year ago and so on. No phases, no sudden changes. I always had anxiety for as long as I remember. Past 6 years old, I was never capable of real anger, I always had complete control over my actions. People said puberty and hormones would change me a lot, but it was easy for me and changed nothing about me. nnI have a strong will to live and have never suffered from depression even after all of this (despite it running on my mom's side of the family). I'm intelligent, have a high emotional intelligence, strong intuition, will power, strength, stubbornness, and have no personality. My voice tone changes so often, my personality and attitude switching, but only I notice. I often feel blank like nothing. My lifestyle would make any normal human feel pathetic and depressed, but not me. For the past 3 years I have been home schooled. Instead of studying I cheat, and pretend to be studying all day while in reality I'm playing video games (not even games that could have a violent or negative influence on me). That's how it is all day everyday, and I don't have friends. It's quite foolish, but I can get away with it, and I only study for SATs. I even had a bunch of friends before I became homeschooled, and I didn't miss them one bit. I'm honestly unsure if I would even cry if someone I loved died.  nnI'm quite confused why I am me. My whole life, my chest was sunken inwards. When I started growing quickly it became a large sunken hole. I was insecure about it my whole life and got a dangerous and painful procedure to fix it recently. My father has anger issues (not physially abusive), from my point of view he's not like fire (anger), he's like boiling water (emotions). He holds grudges, his behavior or how he will react is unpredictable. He causes scenes in public sometimes. He's self-aware in some sense and tells me to never behave like him. He's a good teacher and father, and then he's not. He threatens me (of physical abuse). These things happen rarely, and that's because of how I act around him. Most of the time things are good and happy, but I don't feel comfortable. He doesn't truly take my comfort into consideration. I'm always walking on eggshells, and like him less as I get older. He talks about my mother like she's crazy or like she's stupid. My father has no idea how childish and messed up he actually is. When he's angry he will scream and get in my face and try to hurt my feelings, he will threaten me, mock me. He has no patience for stupidity, he will make fun of me, yell at me, he'll get angry if I'm not able to figure out a simple task (it always happened when I was a little child but not anymore). When I used to cry about how much I missed my mom he would yell at me. He's selfish, his feelings get hurt incredibly easily. On the surface we look like a happy family (and that's what he thinks), but I only adjust my personality for him to avoid any trouble so those occurrences never happen. My mom and dad split apart when I was a baby. It was a terrible divorce, and I ended up getting messed up as a toddler by my mother. I had ADHD at the time (which turned to ADD) and I would always try to look like a girl (because of my cousin one year older than me who was a girl).  My mother is paranoid (may have some sort of disorder) and put me on medication. However, it made me go crazy. I was getting brought to doctors left and right, she was freaking out trying to figure out what was wrong. I'm not sure what they gave me, but it made me blink nonstop and act crazy. She ended up giving me to my father, who happily accepted me and moved away immediately.  I was heart broken that I couldn't see my mom and cried so much. I missed her so badly and never got to see her. Thinking about how much I missed my mother even makes me feel like crying now. He made me become better after quite a rough time, and then my mom wanted me back. This resulted in lots of fighting and I ended up trying to get my dad in jail in a desperate attempt to be with my mom again (I was 6). I was able to convince people that my dad had abused me, and I ended up with my mom for 3 weeks. Everyone was fighting in court and I was transported to some hospital with a bunch of crazy kids without parents to care for them. My dad won with his intelligence, and I ended up with him. I rarely get to see my mom and half brother, and I really miss them. I see them every 3-4 months for a couple weeks. There is much more that's happened to me, but these are probably the most damaging things.nnI believe it's possible that I have inherited my moms traits. Both my mom and dad showed early signs of a sociopath as children (killing small animals, abused in different ways), but from what I hear about my mom, I probably inherited her traits. After all this time, my dad is still the same, but I believe my mom is a better person (or has fooled me to believe so in hopes that I will end up with her).nnnnIf you met me, you'd never be able to fathom that what I wrote was true. I'm a kind, soft spoken, shy, energetic, quiet, intelligent, weird, serious, goofy, stubborn, absent minded, low energy person (and more). It's like I can't act how I truly think, I'm so much more than what I seem on the surface. Honestly, everything wrong with me should cancel each other out. I'm unsure of what I really have and what is emotional damage. nn",1
5095,"ComradeClout","post","My social anxiety is ruining my life and I don't think I'm getting the help I need","I have had pretty debilitating social anxiety for most of my life, and it has had a profound impact on me. My doctor noted my high blood pressure (even though i eat well, am skinny, and walk a lot) and my frequent weight loss (I was already underweight and the first year of hs alone i lost 15+ lbs) and loss of appetite (some days I have so much anxiety I can't eat all day or else i get sick, and I went weeks barely eating anything before because of it). I had literally no friends in middle school and barely any in high school, and it just made the whole experience miserable and I regret so many things that I couldn't do because of my social anxiety. I'm unable to make new friends and meet new people or apply for jobs, and it has affected my academic life considerably, and I have missed out on a lot of opportunities, experiences, and friendships because of it. A friend of mine applied to college and I decided I didn't want to miss out on another opportunity so I applied too and long story short he ended up hurting himself and put himself in the hospital and dropped out but I stayed and I didn't want college to be a re-run of high school and middle school where my social anxiety keeps me from having a normal happy life, so I talked to the campus therapist about it and she said my anxiety was pretty bad and highly recommend I see the nurse practitioner, so I did and I was prescribed Lexapro. I was on it for a few weeks and this did nothing to help my anxiety, and I told her it wasn't helping and she upped the dose but it still didn't help, and I told her this but she seems confident in continuing in this manor. I have regular panic attacks everyday and for the past few weeks it has been so bad that I cannot even go out and have missed a lot of class, consequently effecting my grades, and this just adds on the anxiety I already have. I also lost a lot of weight that I really shouldn't be losing, barely ever eat, never talk to people, and I picked up smoking cigarettes recently to try to help with the constant panic attacks, and it gives some relief but I really don't want a cigarette habit. At this point I'm willing to do anything that will help.nEdit: I also thought that I should talk about an experience that I had at my high school prom. I went alone and had a pretty bad time and even though I went to school with everyone there since elementary school, I felt like a stranger and like I was at a party of people that I didn't know at all, and was just in a constant state of anxiety and depression because I was the only loser there without a date and everyone was having so much fun, and were having one last great get together after a fun 4 years of hs and I felt like I just barely scraped by and I hated myself for not being able to have friends and not doing anything fun in high school and missing out on what was suppose to be one of the best experiences of my life. My friend is prescribed adderall and his girlfriend took some of it recreationally at prom and my friend offered me some (which he offered me before but i declined because I get kinda paranoid about trying drugs) but I was like fuck it - tonight can't possibly get any worse, so i split a 20mg with him (because I was too paranoid to take the full 20) and took 10mg and about 30 minutes after-when it kicked in- I no longer had the burden of my social anxiety. Having no social anxiety felt like I found a piece of my life that I was missing all along, and I just felt normal for once in my life. It was just unexplainable how it felt to not only be around people, but talk to people too and NOT have constant panic attacks and be able to talk so fluently without second guessing myself and overthinking everything I was gonna say. I ended up talking to some people that I haven't talked to since freshman year, made a few new friends, and even danced a bit (which are all things I would have NEVER dreamed of doing in a million years, and I loved that I was able to do it). This is the only time in recent memory where I didn't have social anxiety from being in public like that. I was also able to eat in public too, which I usually never do because I have no appetite at all if I'm anxious and Im anxious all the time in public, and will refrain from eating in front of people, even if I'm really hungry and haven't ate in a while. I feel like this is something I would like to bring up to the campus therapist or nurse practitioner when I see them again, but I don't know how they would feel about me admitting to using medication illicitly like that. I would like your guys' opinion on that as well if you wouldn't mind. Thank you all again so much for the help!",1

5135,"QuantFIN","post","Need Med. Help: What's After Klonopin (My First Benzo)?","So, I am a 19 YO, male college student. I've been living with SAD and ADHD for many years, but was finally diagnosed this summer after reaching out for help. The anxiety has made my social life nonexistent and I never attended any parties in highschool and never went out with friends (although I frequently talked to people I had come to know in school); however, when I'm alone, I'm typically the calmest person ever, so I don't have general or random anxiety. As for the ADHD, I could barely focus on my schoolwork and was easily distracted by anything. It was as if my mind was not cooperating with me if I wanted to complete a task. Anxiety-wise, just being in public makes me very self-conscious. Mostly in social situations, my heart rate goes way up, my thoughts start racing, I start sweating, I stumble over my words, I can't think, etc. nnSo, initially, my health insurance had just expired and I was changing insurers, so I was diagnosed at a university hospital's behavioral center. The treatment was relatively poor, but it was free and my only option. I was put on very low doses of Vistaril, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, etc. and nothing worked. These were very low doses for some reason, again. At the end of this one month program, I was recommended by the nurse (I never had a psychiatrist or psychologist while there; they were all nurses or nurse practitioners who could prescribe medications). nnSo, under the recommendation of the nurse, I had 3 sessions at a specialized ADHD/Mood and Behavioral Center. I was diagnosed with ADHD in my first session. I spend probably $2,000 for 3 sessions, meds. included. I tried Concerta, Vyvance, then a slightly higher dose of Vyvanse. nnShortly after my last session, I was finally insured and began seeing an actual psychiatrist down by my university. She's absolutely great, caring, and very knowledgeable. I was first put on 2x 20mg Adderall IR (taken off of Vyvanse) for ADHD and Prozac 1x 20mg for my SAD. nnNext appointment, I was switched from the 2x 20mg Adderall IR to 1x 30mg XR and increased the Prozac to 1x 40mg a day. nnThird appointment, I was put back on Adderall IR, this time 2x 30mg (XR meds. don't really work for me, not to mention I lift weights and eat a ton, so I am relatively heavy, so I may have a high tolerance when it comes to meds.), was prescribed Wellbutrin XR 1x 150mg for ADHD/SAD, and lastly, I was prescribed .5mg of Klonopin to be used as need, given my anxiety symptoms hadn't improved. nnSince I have my next appointment in January (1 month since last appointment), I often call if I need refills. The .5 dose of Klonopin was the most effective thing I've ever been prescribed that combated my social anxiety (except Phenibut, which I experimented with in high school; withdrawals were hellish, but the effects were heavenly; I could speak to anyone without constant fear or stumbling over my own words). So, I called and spoke with my psych and the .5mg used as needed was bumped up to 2x 1mg daily. A few weeks later, I requested a higher dose, since the new dosage really didn't have an impact. I didn't develop tolerance because there was never such a ""noticeable"" impact in the first place. Other meds. I'm on for SAD (Wellbutrin and Prozac) have done absolutely nothing to reduce my social anxiety symptoms, so Klonopin at least did something. nnI am currently on 3x 1mg daily and I am not seeing any substantial benefit from this dosage. I could tell it's working, but it doesn't really alleviate as much anxiety as I would expect. I know it's often refereed to as ""subtle"", and I would agree, but it is so subtle that I would rather not take it and experience a tiny increase in anxiety. To know what a higher dose would do and what I could tolerate, I only once violated the label instructions and took 5x 1mg in a day, and even still couldn't tell the difference from 3x 1mg a day. I don't know if I'm not responsive to the drug or if it is not targeting my anxiety, but I want to change this med. nnI know that benzos are incredibly addictive and can produce terrible, and rarely fatal, withdraw symptoms. I am somewhat educated on the topic, so you do not have to explain/persuade me to get off benzos. I believe in the sheer power of benzos when it comes to anxiety relief and have lost most hope in SSRI's. So, what other benzos have been effective for any of you (would be great if Klonopin did not work for you, either). I don't experience any negative side effects at all from my current meds., which is suprising. The klonopin, however, does make me drowsier at night (like a normal sleep schedule), where typically I would be able to remain awake with little issue. I have heard of Xanax and Valium. Other than that, I wouldn't go for something I haven't heard of. nnAgain, please don't make suggestions tailored towards getting off benzos. I am carefully working with my psychiatrist and doing everything to a tee, so everything is under control. To be frank, I have not made one friend in my first year and a half of college. I have not been to one party yet. I literally know nobody, except my roommate and some people I went to HS with. In HS, I did not have friends outside of school. I do not have any other health conditions and do not have panic attacks or any other mental illnesses aside from ADHD and SAD.nnEssentially, my question is, what benzodiazepine would you recommend for someone who is taking 3x 1mg of Klonopin a day, but not seeing results. Also, the benzo would have to be taken daily. I'm primarily looking at either Xanax or Valium. Thank you and all suggestions/input aside from the ones I mentioned will be thoroughly considered.",1
5139,"QuantFIN","post","Best Benzo for Social Anxiety (I'm Not Responding to Klonopin)?","I posted a similar thread, but it was way too long. So, here's a condensed one.nnDiagnosed with ADHD and SAD this past summer, after my freshman year of college. No social life whatsoever and had constant pressure/anxiety when in social situations. Rapid heart rate, racing thoughts, etc. are some physical symptoms. ADHD completely ****ed me over in HS and in college. I did well, but I know I could have been a top student. Always distracted, hyperactive (not socially, though), can barely concentrate or focus without meds., etc.nnSo, I went to a ****ty, free behavioral center at a university hospital this past summer to finally seek help, where I was diagnosed; I never saw one doctor or psychiatrist, only crappy nurses who didn't seem to care or take input. Was changing insurances at the time, so this was my only option. Meds. I was prescribed there: Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Gabapentin, and Wellbutrin. Everything in very small low/beginner doses (not sure why, maybe hospitals are more restrictive and it was a one month program).nnInsurance cleared and now I see an awesome psych. She put me on Adderall (tried IR and XR, switched back to 2x 30mg IR), 1x Wellbutrin 150mg, 1x 40mg Prozac, and 1x 0.5mg Klonopin (yeah, baby). I told her my anxiety levels had not reduced, so she offered (I never asked) the Klonopin to be used as need. I gleefully said yes, knowing benzos are the best anxiety-reducers, and picked up my script. This first prescription had the most effect on my anxiety than any other drug (nothing else had worked). This is probably why I overestimated the efficacy of the drug. I called twice in a matter of 3 weeks to increase the dosages (first .5mg as needed -&gt; 2x 1mg daily -&gt; 3x 1mg daily. Klonopin has been overwhelmingly disappointing and I do not think I respond to it. To see how much it would take to alleviate at least some of my anxiety, I took 8mg in one day, but there was not really a big difference. There's no euphoria, no noticeable reduction of anxiety, etc. It just makes me sleepy late at night, whereas I would usually be able to push through it. This drug gives me a weird feeling and does not target my anxiety. All SSRI's I've tried have not done anything, honestly.nnOn Monday, I'm calling and asking to change meds. (1 week after dosage increase). It's not helping and the more time I'm on it, the more the drug builds in my system (worse withdraw). I am going to request either Xanax or Valium. Which of these should I prioritize to reduce my social anxiety? What are the dosages like for these drugs? Are they taken daily/multiple times a day? Have any of you specifically not responded to Klonopin and found one of these other benzos to be effective? Thank you.nnP.S. I am aware of the dangers and addictive qualities of benzos. I am closely working with my psych to find the best solution, so there is no need to derail the question.",1

Sometimes when i'm alone i feel lonely, but when i go outside again i realize how fucked up this society is, i am more comfortable when i'm alone, i don't need anyone, i was always isolated, introverted, and without friends my entire life, why should i change that? I can't miss anything i've never had, and just started to accepting it and get happy with it and done. The only thing the psychiatry helped me is to not to overthink so much like ''what random strangers might think about me when i walk past them'' so yeah, that's 1 good thing.nnBut the other thing pisses me of so much.... i. can't. fucking. talk.nI never talked to my parents, i never talked to anyone, seven hells, even my psychiatrist knows more about me in 3 meetings than my parents for 20 years and i'm barely able to talk to her, 'cause i don't know what the fuck to say, i have nothing to say, my interests are space, history, really old stuff no one knows shit about or doesn't care. Other than that i play games the entire day or watch movies... But nothing interesting to talk about with others at my age...nnSoo. I can't hold a conversation at all, i can't start it and things get weird pretty quickly. I guess that's what most of us get through. So how do i break it?nnMy only motivation? lmao, i am pathetic. My only motivation to change is because of another girl that works at the psychiatry as a student and i, well, how can i say this? seems like i got a fucking crush on her and it makes things WORSE.

I have overcome social anxiety now, but as I am passionate about personal development and self-actualization, I thought that Ayahuasca could be the perfect tool to clear out residual issues with anxiety and improve myself generally.nnnSo in August 2017, I headed into the Peruvian Amazon to try it.nnnTo begin with it seemed like my hunch about Ayahuasca was absolutely correct.nnnI did eight ceremonies in two different retreat centres. The first place was basically duff, so I won’t dwell on that. But the four ceremonies I did at the second place I went to were excellent:nnn- I experienced a lot of incredible visionsn- Felt my body pulsing and vibrating with vitalising energyn- Received a lot of great insights and teachingsn- I came back to the UK full of greater love for myself and othersn- I was able to repair fractured relationships within my familyn- I developed a deeper understanding of myself n- I felt more comfortable in my own skin, happier and more relaxed than I had ever been beforen- I felt very different, people commented on the change and I noticed the impact it was having on my interactions with other peoplen- I was more confident socially than I had ever been before, and was having better quality interactions on a daily basisnnnSounds pretty awesome huh? nnnUnfortunately, those changes didn’t last.nnnWithin a few weeks old tensions in my family had resurfaced, members slipped back into longstanding feuds and silences were reinstated; some of my old negative behaviour patterns started to re-emerge; and I returned to (more or less) my baseline of social confidence. Although I should add that I do think I have retained a greater sense of self-knowledge and self-acceptance from my Ayahuasca experience.nnnWhile in Peru I heard people say many mystical things about Ayahuasca, such as how you experience direct communion with a “higher intelligence” and the “spirit of the vine” etc. But I can’t say I truly felt this. I have used other hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD and psilocybin (magic mushrooms), and Ayahuasca just felt like another hallucinogenic drug experience. I didn’t feel I was accessing the “spirit plane” or communing with the ""infinite consciousness"". I felt like I was lying on a mattress in the jungle tripping balls.nnn**So...does it cure social anxiety?**nnnIt’s not for me to categorically dismiss the power of Ayahuasca as a healing modality. I have read many reports and heard firsthand accounts of it “curing” people’s depression and anxiety.All I can do is relate my own account.nnnFor me, Ayahuasca was a great experience at the time, and for the period immediately following the ceremonies I was confident I had solved all my (and even some other people’s) problems and become a better version of myself. Some of those positive changes, such as the self-knowledge and self-acceptance I mentioned above, have endured to an extent. However, I have found that as the weeks and months have gone by, I am more or less back to the baseline that I was at before.nnnI heard people talk of “Mother Ayahuasca working her magic through you for years after drinking"", but, to be honest, I am sceptical of this. I feel like I had some powerful hallucinogenic trips and those effects have now worn off - much like when I took magic mushrooms in the past and felt I had unlocked the secrets of the universe, only to wake up the next day and find I was back to my normal, waking consciousness and was still fundamentally the same person as before.nnnI may go back in a year’s time just to make sure I’m not missing out on some amazing cosmic ride or that there's something that I’m just not ""getting”. But having done eight ceremonies already and with the price of plane tickets to Peru being what they are, this is slightly doubtful.nnnFor me far more noticeable and lasting changes come about from meditation and psychotherapy, especially, social challenges and exposure therapy. By actually practicing things “in real life”, I can feel myself learning new responses to things which I once feared. If I get up and make a speech in front of a room of strangers, I can feel my confidence grow and my ideas about public speaking changing instantly. That’s not some questionable insight I’ve had while tripping on hallucinogenic drugs.nnnI believe a lot of overcoming social anxiety is about unlearning fearful behaviour patterns by overwriting them with positive responses to the previously feared stimulus and thus creating new, positive behaviours. For me, this is best done with real practice in the social environment, not lying on a mattress in a far-flung jungle with my eyes closed while I hallucinate.",1

It's been really helping with the depression, however.nnnnIt is only fueling everything I have been trying to treat - it is making me extremely nervous, making me sweat/blush/flush extremely bad, no matter the social situation. I am currently also on buspirone, which I have noticed as helped with my general anxiety, not so much social anxiety. I have propranolol which I take, but even that doesn't help with the physical symptoms at all (or very, very slightly).

I am extremely afraid to get intimate with women, I cannot talk to them at all, form relationships with them, intact with them. This may seem extremely  messed up, but if they are even remotely pretty,  my brain just goes into this fight or flight mode and I become social inept. I have no problem meeting and interacting with  men, kids, older people, or women who I do not think are pretty - as stupid as it sounds. I am at that point in my life where I am starting to form my own life, get a career,  move away, etc. and the only thing that freaks me out the most is getting in a relationship with a woman.  I've noticed myself starting to back out of social situation/cancel plans because I am afraid (of what?). I haven't been in a relationship in god knows how long.

I have 2 pretty close friends who go to 2 different schools and at times we just stop talking for weeks on end. My problem is that I can't communicate with anyone. It's so just troubling and I overthink everything. I've been reading posts on here for a bit and most of the things that I saw, I have. I have no friends in school and I'm ugly and fat, so it's hard to actually talk to people. Girls constantly are just hard to talk to and I really just can't do it. Even if it's some random girl, I'll still freak out and my face will turn red and I'll start doing all of these nervous things that just make me seem weird. I have depression and a ton of things. None of them diagnosed, but it's obvious that I do. I don't mind not talking to friends and such at school, because I'm used to it and have never had anything real besides my 2 friends at different schools. nnI think my main issue is dating. I've dated one girl online and absolutely loved it, I really couldn't understand how she could like me, but it only lasted a few weeks, as does most online things. I don't consider that dating to me, as it just stopped very fast. I've always felt good texting online and just talking to people online because they can't see me and I don't have to think of words on the spot. But the thing is, I really want a gf irl. I can't be with any popular girls most likely, as any popular girl I've ever liked just started dating someone else. So I've been liking unpopular and antisocial girls most of my high school life. Right now, I like a girl who barely talks and I love seeing or smile. The only reason we've talked is due to a project that we got assigned together in. It's a group of 4 and there's 2 girls and one other guy. The other girl I communicated well with and I don't like her, but the other girl, I just could barely even look at her without feeling like I'm going to pass out. The only words of said to her other than for the project is ""yeah"" or things like that. She is not popular at all from what I can tell and she is from a different school and transferred over here.  I want to help her feel welcomed and just talk to her and say things, but every time I try to talk to her, I just really can't. I don't know what to say and I feel if I just said ""hey"" I wouldn't know what to say next, so I just never say anything. This project thing has been going on for like 2 weeks and yet I've barely said anything to her. Even the other 2 people were absent one day and I still barely said anything. Anyways, this project ends soon so that's pretty much over. I have a month until the semester is over and I I'm transferring classes, so unless she transfers there too, then I won't see her again most likely. This was probably my biggest chance ever, as she was pretty much everything I was, but I kind of lost it. I just really don't want this happening again and I want to talk to the girl next time and actually make it work. I can't do much for this girl anymore due to all of this happening and the project almost over, so unless I can pull off a miracle and not have social anxiety for a day, then I don't think I can do it. nnMy main thing I'm trying to ask you guys is how can I continue. Should I try to get this girls phone number or something on the last day even though I've never done it before, or should I just hope there is a girl next semester like her?

(I chose public speaking because acting would probably send me into cardiac arrest.) I've got extremely severe, heavily medically documented anxiety and have medication I can take, but even when I use it I faint if I'm in front of people like that. I almost passed out this week during class because the professor asked me to repeat something and increase my volume, and I had to grab the shelf on the whiteboard to keep from falling. nnI really don't know how I can get through this class. It's not that I feel like I'm not smart enough or that I'm technically incapable--I used to be on my high school's debate team, but at 24 my anxiety has only gotten more severe and there are a lot of things I can no longer do, even though I really want to. (Debate team was much easier anyways, since I was only ever in front of about 6 people maximum, I had a partner, and it was more of a back-and-forth than a true speech. I was never able to stand in front of a crowd and give a speech or anything. When my parents tried to ""cure"" my ""stage fright"" by sending me to theater camp as a kid, some of the other kids used to stand behind me to catch me because I was constantly on the verge of fainting. Needless to say, it didn't work.) I've never liked speaking in front of people, but I used to be able to grit my teeth and get through it as long as it wasn't for too long. Nowadays I can't even sit at my desk and read something out loud without my throat closing up on me. It's embarrassing; I know if I could just muscle through it it'd be over much faster and no one would pay attention to or notice me, but at this point it's a physical response that I can't control (not for lack of trying). I'm capable of talking to people one-on-one or in smaller groups, but as soon as I'm made to present something, even just in front of one person, I short-circuit. nnHas anyone been able to get a medical exemption from classes like this? I'm honestly afraid of getting hurt because I'm scared I'll pass out in front of everyone and crack my head open or something. inb4 ""just do it, it'll get easier""; that was the plan when I started this class, so far it's still the plan, I'm just scared shitless. I'm already in therapy and have been for many years with various therapists and have been on several different medications with mixed effectiveness. I've learned many coping strategies and am capable of getting through a lot of situations that I couldn't before, but certain things (chiefly this kind of thing, agoraphobia, and asking people for things) have only gotten worse over the years despite all the work I've been putting in. nnshould I talk to the campus disability support office? when I was in high school and just starting to deal with all of this, all they could do was give extended test-taking time. nn**tl;dr:** very severe, lengthily medically documented anxiety vs. college's required public speaking class. almost passed out only 2 classes in. is there any way to get a medical exemption or other accommodation?

She's not really a good professional (barely let me speak), so I can find a much better one for what I pay for in insurance. nn&amp;nbsp;nnSo, **I am currently on (all generic):**     n*60 mg Adderall IR     n*300mg Wellbutrin    n*6mg Klonopin    nn&amp;nbsp;nn**I was on  (all generic):**     n*Zoloft 100mg     n*Prozac 150mg (not during Zoloft).    n*Valium 40mg    n*Xanax 2mg (not while on Valium) nn&amp;nbsp;nnI was with her for 3 months (enough time to know SSRIs I was on weren't working). I should keep a journal because I don't know what the hell worked the best. In RARE cases and when wake up late at night after napping, I'll take my 4-6mg dose of Klonopin at once and my social anxiety is reduced slightly. I definitely feel more relaxed and I feel slightly drunk (in terms of motor skill; however, my mind is unaffected. I can still think almost as clearly and I am more creative, but the anxiety is still mostly there. Self-consciousness is certainly reduced, though (i.e. can walk without thinking I'm being ""judged"". Also, there's no euphoria. I am a big guy and weightlifting is one of my primary hobbies, so that maybe attributes to efficacy, but I can't explain it. This stack isn't working for me. Valium was the most sedating (40mg daily). This was probably the most effective benzo. Xanax did **absolutely** nothing for me (stopped after 2 weeks; could have been a bad batch?) even after trying what are considered ""high dosages"". This was all at Walgreen's (now at CVS for most recent fill). Maybe bad generics, though highly improbable.nn&amp;nbsp;nnI definitely need an SSRI (or MAOI, which I never tried; psychiatrist said they were ""primitive"" and flawed, thus having many side effects; she mentioned dieting and how a food can cause a severe reaction or something) other than Zoloft and Prozac (which didn't work). I have severe social anxiety, but I don't act weird and can talk to people (just I have super high anxiety and always think of what to say). However, I am super avoidant of social interaction out of fear and I have no friends (1.5 years at college so far). I am always self-conscious, sweat when nervous, have trouble talking to strangers, very increased heart rate in certain situations. I know there's nothing that will completely cure my SAD, but I want a stack that will help me develop good habits, unlike the rest.nn&amp;nbsp;nnSo, what do you guys think I should try/resume that has worked for you (want to keep at least 1 benzo) and are there any tips for taking the meds. I am on now that increases efficacy like Klonopin?nn&amp;nbsp;nnP.S. My water consumption (mainly) and food consumption have been relatively low (because of Wellbutrin). I feel like drinking more water would help (barely drink any anymore and I'm 220lbs, 13% BF). I love the Wellbutrin, though. It is helping me get lean. Also, I might switch from Adderall IR to Vyvanse (which is the ""new"" Adderall XR  and is superior to IR and XR. Should I try it? I would need two dosages or 1 booster though (16+ hour days).",1

I can say that I struggle with social anxiety for last 5 years and I am almost 21 years old. It is very painful to live with it and I am waiting for a visit in new clinic in Netherlands so I hope they will help me with it. Nonetheless I'd like to tell you how social anxiety affects my life.nnLast Friday I got fired from work. I was suspecting that before so I will probably on monday to new job. I wasn't a bad worker, I was working as psychical worker (easy job if other people do not make mistakes) I was doing good and I also could do other duties of other people if it was needed, learning everything very fastly. nnSocial Anxiety was the problem. I felt there very uncomfortable, fearing any conflict between me or other person because of humiliation. I do not know when it started, but anxiety about it is just preventing me from talking to anyone in work. The most funny thing is that I was a liked person in work and other people didn't joke about me or try to offend me. I only got nickname ""More Life"" because one guy every day said to me ""More life man"".nNo problem at work with duties or people but I still felt very bad there, to point where I took sick-leave to not go to work because of it. I was often absent at work, and I got informed from other worker that I can get fired soon, so I founded already new job.nnBut again, new work, new people and constant fear because of people surrounding me. It is so greatly affecting me that I loose jobs because of it, I resignated going college because of fear being a ""freak"" around other normal students, not understood by anyone. I fear any contact with other uknown person that I feel only good at home alone. I live alone without any family around or friends, still I am functioning, but I am very sad about my life. nnI had no real girlfriend because of anxiety. I stopped hanging with any friends because of it. I can not go to outside world. Right now the only place I sit is my room. I deleted all social media accounts to separate from others. Now it's impossible for me to connect to other. I realize that I am not that bad at all, in many many aspects I am better than others, but previous years and episodes what happened then hit me so hard that I so awkard....nnEye contact, starting conversation etc. it's like jumping into fire. I fear more of it than any other thing in my life. I try but I can't stop to think what other people will think. My self-esteem is very low in fact, so any critic of my person is very painful. I try to avoid any place or situation where I could be an object of laught or critic. Constant feeling that people watch etc. You understand what I mean. There's also problem of conflict, I really do not know what to say, if someone attacks me verbally I get paralyzed. I didn't had this problem before, but after few years of anxiety I have it also.nnIf I would take off this anxiety, my life would be so fucking better, but no. Instead I sit in house every single weekend for last year.nAnd the longer I am doing this the worse it gets. You do not know then how to talk to people, about what should I talk and you can't tell any stories because life is total boredom.nnI suppose many people have similiar limit put over their lives. I try to be positive about future and I want to treat my SA, but deep inside me is a feeling that I will not fight it. Everytime I met a girl I got so panicked that I avoid any verbal contact. What makes me more sad is that I changed a lot, I lost a lot of weight, my body looks much better, but nothing helps me with Social Anxiety. nnI really do not know what to do now. My last hope for now is mental clinic and therapy (CBT), and if that will not work, then suicide probably will come back to phase of planning. nnIt just how I desperate I am. I am very tired of that kind of life, where I hide from others.",0

Later I found out it was social anxiety. I think the main reason why I had social anxiety was my low self esteem. I felt so fucking ugly and at the same time I was vain, so I couldn't stand people even looking at me. If I were walking down the street and heard someone laughing, I automatically thought they were laughing at me. nnI dropped out of high school in my senior year because of it, countless times I got to the gates of my school and couldn't bring myself to go in, so I just went home. I had to get the equivalent as GED in my country so I could finish high school. Later I went to university, and had to drop out because of SA too.nnAfter dropping out of uni at ~20 yo, I started doing CBT with a psychologist and started taking a medication called Lexapro (it did wonders for me). After six months of therapy and medication, I got back to university, I learned to manage my anxiety better, but it was still pretty bad.nnMy SA was so bad that until I was 23 yo, I had 0 sexual experience and didn't even had my first kiss. At the time I was still doing therapy, but didn't feel like I needed medication anymore.nnOnly when I turned 24 yo things started to get considerably better. With the help of therapy I could fight off negative and irrational thoughts, I made some changes in my wardrobe and started going to the gym. All of that made me more confident in myself, and I finally got a little of self esteem. Now at 24 yo I can say that I have a ""normal"" life, I even have an amazing girlfriend. I'm still shy and timid, but not to the point where it hinders me.nnIn short, these are the things that worked for me:nn* CBT with a GOOD psychologist (it may take some time until you find the right one for you.)n* Take medication. If the one you are taking isn't helping you, talk to your doctor and change it.n* If you dislike your hair, your weight, your style, change it. I was very insecure about my body because I've always been very skinny. Going to the gym helped me a lot with that.n* You HAVE to put yourself out there, there is no easy way out. You have to combine CBT with exposure therapy.nnTreatment for SA is hard and tiring, but it is possible and worth it.nnI wish you all good luck, and, from the bottom of my heart, don't lose hope.",1

I mostly coped with my anxiety by always being tipsy around him, but once we started to get to know each other sober, we started to see incompatibilities. i felt stiff and rigid around him every time, terrified of judgement and anxious. i couldnt just relax and be myself. i started to notice that he would make sort of mean expressions that certain things i'd say, which rubbed me the wrong way. we had a few good times of having sex, but i am unable to orgasm and have some intimacy issues that soon rendered sex between us incompatible...he seemed like he couldnt be a partner to ""work with me"" on my intimacy issues and help me orgasm. he wanted it to just be simple and straightforward, which is understandable, but unfortunately i have some hang ups in that department.nnlast night we tried to have sex again. i'd had a few drinks and i just started the pill, so i got dry during it. he kept asking me ""are you sure you're into this?"" during it and it really offended me and made me feel lesser-than. just put some spit on it and keep going. he actually stopped having sex with me because of the dryness, which i couldnt help. i felt upset by this. the interaction that played out afterwards was tense &amp; horrible. he does not like to talk about his emotions or work through things, but i do. the night ended with him saying he wants to be with me and likes me but that we're incompatible because i am too sensitive for him and he is not sensitive enough for me. he seemed confused about what he wanted because we genuinely do like each other, but he thinks we're too opposite in that regard.nni don't disagree. its true, we are very different in that way. i just feel heartbroken. i think i fell in love with him. he is truly the most attractive guy i have ever had the pleasure of being with, and he has such a great heart. he is ambitious, kind, funny, respectful, and was patient with me...just not patient enough, i guess. the fact that he doesn't like to talk about issues and work through them sucks. nnThis feeling truly sucks. yes, i am sensitive. yes, i have anxiety. and i know it might be a lot for partner to understand, even though i am in therapy and working on myself rigorously. he just doesn't want to deal with it i guess, because he doesn't understand it. every time i saw him i felt better and better, and felt closer to him...which is all i needed, but i think he is at a point where he doesn't want to deal with anyone else's emotions.nni feel so heartbroken. i have never felt this way about anyone before. maybe this is my great heartbreak in life. im terrified of how much worse this is going to feel. i know im going to dream about him and think about him every day, probably for years. because thats just how i am. i don't know if i could handle seeing him in public, i'd probably freeze up and run away or something. nnit just baffles me that two people can get close and then BAM, just stop talking. just like that. i mean yeah, we're incompatible, but we are also compatible in other ways or else we wouldn't have felt such a connection....why can't he just open his heart and work with me to build a beautiful and intimate relationship? i guess he just wants to look out for himself. this world is so cruel. so cruel...i am heartbroken.",1

I've been reflecting on my history of relationships and rejection and it seems as though any time I was genuinely very physically attracted to a guy, I always get dumped. It's like I can't relax around them and be myself, I'm worrying too much about how I appear to them.nnI think part of this anxiety stems from the fact that I have a fear of abandonment when they find out who the ""real me"" is. Generally, because of my social anxiety, I only meet men while I'm drinking...when tipsy or drunk I am like a different person; outgoing, bubbly, confident...in reality I am more reserved, observant, shy, and extremely introverted.  Part of me feels like when they find out who I really am, they won't like me and they will run away...and it's been true every time. So it's like this vicious cycle of anxiety. I don't want to feel like I have to drink to be approachable and outgoing to men I like, but without it my social anxiety causes me to freeze up and fills me with feelings of fear and worthlessness. nnWith this past guy, he came on extremely strong and was putting me on a pedestal...practically saying he was in love with me by the 4th time we hung out. This made me anxious because I knew he didn't really know me...so then it made me feel like I had to act like someone I'm not to fulfill his fantasy of who he thought I was. He kept saying how im ""real"" and ""different"" and how he loves our conversations. All of that is the real me, but im more than that too...there is another side to the coin. My anxiety has made me who I am, and when I would try to be honest with him about it, he didn't really understand it. He was invalidating and just blamed it on me ""questioning myself too much"" and stuff like that. He wasn't understanding, so then it made me freeze up even more and shut down around him...feeling like i had to put on a mask to be someone else. nnIt's really sad because I have never been that physically attracted to anyone before. Well, I have, but not in years. It's really rare that I find someone who's my ""type""...I would look at him and literally think he is just the most beautiful thing ever - I think I fell in love with him a bit...he glorified me, made me feel so special. he was ambitious, intellectual, and handsome as hell...but he seemed to lack empathy and was incapable of having discussions about emotions. nI can see that the relationship was incompatible and I'm trying to move on, but I can't help but feel rejected for who I am...I've spent my whole life hiding behind a computer, drugs or alcohol, or a toxic relationship...ive been in therapy for almost two years, really working on myself...with this relationship I really tried to give it my all and put myself out there...tried to use all the skills I've learned from therapy, be myself, take a chance despite my horrific anxiety....and sure enough, I was rejected again.nnIt was really sad because I slowly saw him losing interest. He started making mean faces at me and saying judgmental things...causing me to freeze up and get even more anxious.I am a sensitive person and I pick up on that stuff, and then it makes me freeze up even more. I needed to feel safe with him, but i didn't...He made me feel on top of the world, and then ripped the rug out from under me when he found out I'm not the fantasy girl he had hoped I was.nnI just feel like I will never fall in love mutually or be with someone I truly want to be with who I'm genuinely very attracted to...in the past I've dated men who I wasn't that into because i felt ""safer"" with them, but thats a terrible feeling as well. I feel hopeless, I had such high hopes for this relationship...it just seems like any time I try to get vulnerable and try something new my anxiety gets the best of me...thats not the only reason this relationship failed, but i can't help but feel embarrassed by it. if only i could just be confident around the people im genuinely attracted to...",1

With most of them I wait till the pharmacy is closed to call so I get the robot instead of a real person picking up the phone (though even the robot voice makes my heart jump most of the time) but 2 of them are for my ADD, and since they're controlled substances I have to call my doctor's office to get a new prescription written every month, and this really fucks with me.  I don't know why but if I wait till late to just leave a voicemail the lady at the desk will always call me back the next day or so and ask me questions, even if I left all the info in the voicemail anyway.  Since I'm at college my mom picks the scripts up from the doctors office for me, gets my meds from the pharmacy and mails them to me (I tried going to a pharmacy near school my freshman year but my SA constantly kept me from going and I was always running out of my meds).  She used to also call them in for me but now that I'm 20 she's really pushing me to be more self sufficient.  Ugh, it just make it really hard to stay on top of it when I'm too anxious to pick up the phone.  ",1

I've struggled with extreme social anxiety that appeared in high school and although I've improved so much in the years since then, all of my interpersonal relationships have been up until this point, a struggle. I have also only asked out two girls in my life. Since graduating from high school my anxiety has been a quarter of what it was, but for whatever reason it will randomly appear and unfortunately it shows because although I've really come out of my shell and can talk to almost anyone easily now without trembling, shaking and stuttering, socially I feel as though I come off as awkward and I think people often get the wrong idea about me, at least initially. I have a very positive self image of myself but I feel as though I put too much importance on the significance of dating and relationships when they're really not that important. I'm a good hearted person and one of the nicest you could ever meet, and I think that's why everything troubles me.nnNow this is where I need people on the outside of my situation to tell me what they think because I've been a train wreck this year. So, last year, one year after leaving high school, I had a family emergency and I had to help a family member out in the sketchy part of town in the middle of the night. On my way back I had run into a prostitute, now I had no money so I didn't do anything but I just couldn't get the thought out of my mind. Unfortunately I looked online soon after then met up and actually did it, with someone 45+, I consider it the biggest mistake of my life now. It ate at me all of last year and I was going to end it all because I felt hopeless. I realized that I only had one friend to turn to and finally contacted anyone outside of my family since high school but I couldn't open up, and the entire year I shut everything out.nnI was just depressed the whole year. I stopped doing any hobby, I didn't go out at all, I had no enjoyment in anything any more. But I got a new job near the end of the year and I think it saved my life. I met so many nice people and had the most fun I ever had in years, but I still felt like I couldn't be myself and I was always battling the thought that people thought I was weird or unsocial, even though I had fun with pretty much everyone. Because before I slept with the prostitute people called me weird because I shook or stuttered even just sitting in a class room, but I knew deep down that it was just the anxiety and that I wasn't some weirdo, but after this its like I've never kissed a girl or been on a date yet i've had sex, and i'm nervous talking to girls I like, Its the worst combination.nnSo things go great at the job and even though i'm depressed and falling out of everything I had an interest in, at least i'm happy at work and at school. Now there were so many nice girls at my job and I liked a lot of them, but I couldn't help but feel guilty because they thought that I was so nice and i just couldn't feel right. I was also always easily bothered by negative things people said and broke down at the start of the year, but I finally opened up to my sister and she didn't care and still accepted me, which I didn't believe would happen.nnSo months pass and I meet a girl who I personally thought was amazing, but I had heard about her social media through my coworkers and after looking at it I was blown away and thought that she was incredible. I had spoken to her before numerous times and she was very kind, but after seeing what was online, I think I let my ideas run away. I pretty much set out to improve myself, and did a little. I bought all these new clothes and ventured outside of my house again but I still couldn't enjoy my interests and still couldn't really concentrate on school, but I think I went farther than I ever did.nnNow she was a couple years older than me and I thought that she was the best looking person there, not to mention the nicest. I think that this was a major problem because I think i felt like it would validate me, like this was going to prove that i wasn't just some loser or weirdo doomed to be awkward and fail. I think i just made too much of it and thought it wayyy more than what it should have been. I had even started to feel horrible about having changed myself because I felt like it was only because of this girl and that I was putting her on a pedestal and I then felt guilty about even looking at her social media, but I decided that I would just ask her out and that if she rejected me then that would be it. And that made me feel ok about it, so I did.nnWell she agreed to go out, and although it was nice, the second I even thought about it from casual friend to dating I instantly had all of the symptoms of social anxiety again, all the ones that I thought went away, the trembling the shaking, the nervousness etc. She was a self described slow text (2 per day) so you can only imagine what I thought. I had even confronted her about it but she quickly apologized and said that she was interested but she was also dating someone else but didn't know if she liked him. After having asked her out though, I couldn't talk to her in person at all I became trembly, shaky, nervous and she still put up with it and didn't seem weirded out. But after four or five times of the nonsense she looked tired of it and I felt as though I was never going to be able to have a normal relationship ever because these felt out of my control and I couldn't even stop them, for as much as I tried even I thought it was horrible.nnI fell into major depression and thought that everyone would think that I was some weird creep, that these things from my past have messed up my mind and any relationships I would ever have in the future. So I quit my job and decided to end it all. But after I couldn't end it I broke down and after losing the job and people that i actually enjoyed more than anything, I decided to get help.nnI now have no secrets with my entire family and opened up and they completely accepted me. I reached out to all of my old friends who I havent talked to in years and they were all really there for me, even the girl from work was surprisingly there for me and didn't just block me out, but i'd feel terrible to even contact her ever again. I'm going to therapy and I just really regret not having ever opened up to my family or going out as a teen and having relationships and not interacting because these things really mess up your life and ability to function as an adult.nnI've always thought of relationships as some major thing but now i see that they're really just some small not so significant things in the grand scheme of life and that i can't take these teenage ideas and experiences into my adult life because they're completely illogical and fallacious.nnIt is a struggle, but at least now I understand what the problems always were and I dont feel hopeless. I feel like i'll finally be able to live undepressed and unanxious and most importantly, like i can express myself and be who i really am without feeling so much shame. I think this whole thing saved my life in all honesty, and the story basically ends here today.nnAm I a bad person? Is all of this understandable? I would greatly appreciate any insights because all of these things had made me feel guilty for a long time. Thank you for taking the time to read this if you did. And please mental health is serious if you know someone who's struggling get them help before they do anything potentially harmful to themselves or others.n",1

5291,"lost_Usr1","post","22M, live abroad is killing me","Hello reddit, I moved to Europe, when I was 14. My mother already lived there for 3 years and I lived in Ukraine with my grandparents. nI was never really asked if I wanted to move but I also didn't think about living in other country and leaving everything behind as a big problem. nFirst half of the year was a horror. I spoke to almost no one. I learned German for a year prior to moving to Europe and it was not enough for me to instantly make friends. nAlso, the last couple of years at school in Ukraine were pretty difficult for me, as I was constantly bullied. I was weak and skinny and didn't know how to protect myself. But even then, I didn't have any other problems outside school. nSo, back to Europe, from my first days here, I tried to speak to my new schoolmates as good as I could. But I also started to shield myself from people. Like, if I try to look unfriendly or dangerous, nobody will try to make fun of me. I behaved myself like this, when I was in public. It's not, like I was being impolite to people, but I tried to always have this ""don’t mess with me look"", if this makes any sense. nHowever, knew country, new rules. I didn't have to be afraid of being attacked physically. Instead I couldn’t argue or counter jokes from my classmates. This time I was vulnerable not, because I was weak, but because I didn't know the language well.nI also went to a second school simultaneously. My week looked like this: twice a week a returned home at 8pm, because of two schools, where I hadn't time to go home between them. The rest of time I had to study.nMy first winter holidays, which I spent back in Ukraine, were both a relieve and a horror. I had to go privately to a German teacher almost daily. In first summer I had about 3-4 teachers to prepare me for both schools. All this was awful, but stilly I had my friends at home and was overall happy.n**Until one day it started.** I was going back from my German teacher (who was a really nice person, and who taught me really a lot grammar, that helped me immense with my German, so it's not like I totally hated learning German). nBut let's go back. So, I was going back from my ""class"".  I was a usual way for me: just a bit uphill along the road towards the bus stop. Suddenly it was more difficult for me to breath and I felt like, if I would start breath more, people would notice it and, that I looked really awkward. nAfter that, I drove back home and felt myself completely normal. nBut this situation repeated itself more and more during that summer. I started to notice the way I breathe even on my way to the teacher.nI think, this is where it all started. As I was back in Europe, I started being conscious about how I move my feet or my arms. I was always aware of where I was looking at, how my lip was positioned. I didn't know how to look in people's eyes, whether I looked unfriendly etc.nI still had no friends at European school, I haven't had any walks which I had constantly with my friends back in Ukraine. It looked like the kids where either going out the way I didn't understand or the didn't do it at all. nYears went by, the only time I enjoyed my life, was when I had winter or summer holidays and was back in Ukraine. There I could talk to people, I even managed to make new friends, with whom I still have good contact. I just felt myself normal.nAfter about 2-3 years later, I managed to tell my mother, that something was wrong with me. (It's not easy for a kid to admit, that something is wrong with his head! And I didn't have a good connection to my mother at that time)nShe took me to her psychiatrist. I was prescribed with some weak antidepressant. I guess I helped with my mood a bit, but it had done shit to my social anxiety. I just tried to suppress the way I felt and had from time to time breakdowns. My only dream was to finish school and University and leave that fucking country. nSince no one here needed me, I decided, I would manage everything on my own. I finished both schools. It may sound like it isn't bad after all. Well, no. nAll this time it felt like I lost that autopilot and had to manually control the way I move, or where to look at the person I speak to. I still didn't feel connected to people around me. I could not make jokes, which the class would find funny. I didn't speak to anyone outside my class. I felt isolated and people around me perceived me the same way. nI wasn't interested in my future carrier or, in what to study. My only dream was to leave this country. Instead of leaving, I thought, that it would be a waste to give up an opportunity to study in Europe. I also didn't want to disappoint my relatives. And, to be honest, I was afraid to change anything, go back home and take exams to be able study there. I also didn't want to look like an idiot, coming back, when everybody else wanted to leave Ukraine for better future. nI think, I should have done that. If not for studying, but just to have a year off, relax, get rid of SA and may be come back to study. n(It's important to mention, that most of the social anxiety symptoms weaken, after I get back home for, at least a month. But even from the first day on, I always felt myself a lot better )nBut I haven't done that. Instead I thought, I could power myself thought University, get a bachelor and leave this fucking country forever. nI tried studying two different faculties, I hoped, that at the University I would finally able to connect to new people and have fun (so that I would even decide to stay in Europe).nThat never happened. I tried to study mechanical engineering, but from the beginning the math was just unmanageable for me and I couldn’t find a group to study together. Well, if I can't have fun talking to someone new, since I am to anxious, I can't fit in a group to study, because you must speak there and, like, make friends :)nIn Europe there are no persistent classes at the Universities. You either have a lection in a huge auditorium or have smaller classes, with 20-40 persons for something like practicing math, where you must solve your prepared homework in front of whole group. I had to do it twice and I felt almost like I am fainting. nThe most time I spent at home, where I didn't have to feel constant fear and be in fight or flight mode. During one summer in Ukraine I met my current girlfriend. nLater, I decided to study CS at a so-called University of Applied Science, where after three years of fixed classes I would have my bachelor and could go back to Ukraine. I had to wait almost a year to sign me up for that University. In the meantime, I found a job, where I am basically all levels of support and a junior sysadmin at same time. n(Back in European school a had a specialization in IT because of which we had one year more of school. And the specialization made me hate IT so much, that I didn't realize, that I actually like it)nThe job was fantastic the only ""problem"" was, that every year in August they organized an event for different political, technical, economical, etc topics) and I had to be there for month. During that time I had both to do IT Stuff and help prepare everything for the conference (cheap student labor :D) But that one month of constant work (not 8/5) just crushed me. My anxiety escalated to some new levels, I was constantly stressed. nI was still extra anxious after work but also looked forward to study something I wanted, the way I thought could be the best for me. I expected, that only mathematics would be hard for me, but I also knew you that it would not be as difficult as in a normal University.nI was so fucking wrong about everything. The amount of information was huge. We had constant projects in most of the classes. Moreover, there are supposed to be a lot of group projects. The groups where created all by themselves. I didn't want to be that person without a group and be assigned to somebody I didn't like. All of this made me extremely anxious. Additionally, to my social anxiety I became anxious about everything else. I had to finish every assignment, otherwise I would fail either the final project or the test and then after 3 repeat I would have to repeat the semester. And if you didn't manage to do the first assignment, you will still have to do it, since every next assignment is built upon previous. nBut most important, I could not manage to make social contacts. I was truly afraid of people. It seems, like we have no similar interests. I still do not know how to connect to them. People in Europe just feel so alien to me. Here in Europe, at my University I felt like a totally different person.nI had a lot of breakdowns, I started to cry in the evening and I somehow managed to survive till end of the December and have two weeks off, during which I had to prepare for math exam. But still I was in Ukraine with my girlfriend. nWhat was really killing me is, that I still can perfectly speak to my Ukrainian friends, we can argue, discuss stuff, make fun of each other etc. I have a very nice and understanding girlfriend. I have no problems socializing with them. Or even with meeting new people in Ukraine.nAfter final exams my girlfriend was here with me in Europe, and I still could not relax. When we were in public I constantly was afraid, that I cannot protect her, due to my SA. I also failed two exams and had to retake them after holidays, which made me even more anxious. nMy doctor gave me some new medication, which, for two weeks seemed to lower my social anxiety and it felt awesome. I already lost my belief that there could be any meds that could really help me. And that belief was restored. The only thing I feared, is that it won't hold, like with all previous things that seemed to help me.nAnd, well, it didn't hold. Something happened during the weekends, I can't explain what it is. But it set me off. My fear became true.nThe amount of work for the University increased even more and became unbearable to me. At this point I cry for hours. Last week I spent home, constantly anxious. At this point, I don't know what to do. nI should have left this country for a year after school. Now I feel, like I can't do it. I also feel, like I am already too old to stop studying and make a pause. I don't think, that I will be able to finish this semester, since I have already fallen behind all the classes. I also get very anxious if I try to study and more anxious after every minor difficulty. nMy relatives think, that it wasn’t that bad previously. I think, I just was very good at suppressing it and just can't take it anymore.nWhen I felt myself worse, I was usually prescribed new medication, talked to the therapist. After that I felt a bit better and it was enough to continue suppressing and working on ""more"" important things. nHow long can a person live in a foreign country feeling lonely? I know, that there are people, to whom I am interesting, who like me and care about me. My family is also very supportive. nBut it's not them, who feel anxious about going outside. It's me who is constantly afraid of masses of people, who can't relax outside and can't protect myself from. Any verbal or nonverbal assault. It almost feels like I am at a warzone.nI remember, when I didn't care, how people look at me, ignored if somebody was rude to me. I was able to respond the way I wanted. My head wasn't empty. nNow I just slowly fall apart. I am not suicidal, I guess, because I don't believe in the afterlife and am afraid of death.nHell, I even was more relaxed during this two weeks in Ukraine in winter. It wasn't enough time, but I felt myself free on the streets.nYou probably gonna say, why the hell wouldn't I leave. I know, people would support my decision, I could probably come back later.nBut I don't won't to let down my girlfriend, even if she says, I don't. I didn't finish a university, so nobody would really want to have me work for them and I want to work, so that I won't be an abuse. nI know my options. I just don't have the will to make a decision. I feel like I would get better a bit, like usual and would continue ignoring the problem and maybe in 5 years will slowly finish CS at the University. I just don't think, it is going to be a life. Maybe you together with my girlfriend, it would be easier.nnI don't know, why am I even writing this. I don’t know, whether it’s a right subreddit. Even posting something on the internet makes me anxious. I do not know, what I want to hear from you. Therefore, I will just share this story and hope for something. I also hope, I won’t be deanonymized by somebody.nnI just feel, like for the last 8 years, I lived only episodically, not being able to open my true potential or take the opportunities, I was given. And I feel like I am slowly going insane.nI hope, that this text isn't totally unreadable, since I guess, English is not even my second language . I tried to keep it as short as possible, but I also don’t expect, that anybody would like to read almost 3k words text.nn**TL;DR**nA lot of autobiographical stuff. Moving abroad as a kid literally ruined my nervous system as the years passed by. And my will was never strong enough to decide, what is really important for me and to change my life the way I really wanted. Now, I just can't take my social anxiety anymore and overcome any difficulties of being an adult. The difference between, who I am in one country, and who I am in another is just killing me.n",1
5294,"orGARZAm","post","I have incredibly low self-esteem","My mental health issues started at around the age of 16, and I am now 18 and in college. I have recently really been trying hard to improve myself and become the best version of myself. I have actually been doing very well; depression doesn't affect nearly as much as it did before and I am generally much happier than I have ever been in my life. I also have taken gigantic steps with my social anxiety and I am sort of able to talk to strangers or talk to people 1-on-1 without getting too nervous, but it is still pretty bad in other aspects of my life. For example, I get bad anxiety in groups and in any kind of social events, I still am very self-conscious, I am always feeling judged, and most importantly (and what inspired this post), I feel inadequate in almost all aspects of my life. I feel like I am not good enough when it comes to almost anything, and it is quickly becoming a serious problem that is starting to consume my life.nnI will further expand on this and explain my thoughts on this. I am currently living with my randomly assigned roommates in my dorms, and I love them to death, but they are all very charismatic people. Like, super super charismatic. They constantly party, have friends over, and are pretty much perfect when it comes to being social. They are the epitome of charisma and fun (in my eyes). Being in this constant environment of funny, awesome people in my home has definitely been fun and his given my the opportunity or growth, but it has been very hard on my mental health. I know I am nothing like them and will probably never be as good as them. This is where my low self-esteem really started to blossom and expand into many other aspects of my life. The unique thing about my case, however, is that I know almost all of the things I have low self-esteem over are all ridiculous and silly for the most part. I am very self-aware of my anxious thoughts and have done research, therapy, and other self-help stuff, so I am able to catch myself in the moments when I am letting my anxious thoughts tell me ""you suck"", ""you'll never be good enough"", or other annoying stuff, and I'll repeat to myself that these are my anxious thoughts speaking. But, this doesn't really work for me and my low self-esteem has sort of transformed into a severe ""you're not good enough"" mentality, and I don't know how to handle it. I am constantly telling myself that I am not good enough no matter how hard I try and it's really starting to take its toll on my health. Here are some examplesnn* I think I am unattractive. Like really unattractive to the point that I really don't like my face or my body at all. Realistically, I am not that bad and I do realize this. I started going to the gym at the beginning of college and I am more fit than I have ever been. By no means am I super strong, but you can tell that I go to the gym if you knew me before the transformation. Despite this, whenever I look at my self in the mirror I still think my body and face is not good enough. My arms aren't big enough, my chest isn't big enough, my calves aren't defined enough, etc..nn* I am a pretty big gamer and I am very competitive. I played PUBG for a while and I managed to get to the top 0.5% NA leaderboards, and top 600 NA in kill rating. I still don't think I am good enough. I recently got into Fortnite like 3-4 weeks ago, I have around 20 solo wins, great stats, I got a 16 kill game, and I don't think this is normal for someone who has only played for 3-4 weeks, but I still think I suck. All of my roommates call me a god and say I am such an amazing player, but their compliments mean nothing to me and I still feel disappointed in myself when I don't perform perfectly. I know it's impossible to be perfect at the game in every gunfight, but I still tell myself ""you should have won that game/fight, you're doing bad and you need to get better"". Tbh, when I play alone, I sometimes almost start to cry or hit stuff if I am repeatedly performing poorly. I know how unhealthy that is, but I can't help but hate myself for how bad I am performing in that gaming session.nn* My last example is my academic performance. I am in computer science and currently have a 4.0 in my first semester and am probably going to get around a 3.8 or 3.9 in my second semester. I know these are really good grades, especially for comp sci, but I still feel like I should be doing better. Any scores on assignments/exams that are below a 90% frustrate me. Sometimes not even a 95% will satisfy me. I tell myself that there is someone else in my class who got a 97% and that I should be studying harder, and then proceed to beat myself up over not performing the best. I also tell myself that the only reason I have really good grades is because I am taking freshman level classes and they are easy, so there is no reason to be proud of myself. I know that this overall mentality will not fly in my future school years since my classes will start to get really hard and achieving an A will be nearly impossible, so I am nervous about my future classes. nnI know that all of my examples may seem like a bit of a humblebrag, but I am really not trying to convey that and I am sorry if it comes off that way. I know that I am performing really well and am above average, but I truly think that I am not good enough. I know how weird that sounds. It's a broken and backwards logic, but that is just how my brain works, sadly.nnBasically, I am going through life expecting nothing but perfection from myself. Anything and everything I do MUST be absolutely perfect with no exceptions or I will think it is garbage. It is simultaneously good and bad since I think this mentality drives me to succeed, but I don't think this is a healthy way to go about succeeding. I know I should go to a therapist, but I am just scared to go. I have tried three diff therapists in the past and I never really connected with them very well. I am going to try again this summer and hopefully it works out for me, but honestly idk if I will follow through. I have told myself I will go to a therapist for a while now and I never do.

This partly because of traumatic experiences and genetics. nnThree years ago, it gotten so bad I isolated myself from everyone and everybody. I was still going to school, but I was too scared too be in public. I avoided people and social interventions. I was too scared to even walk over the schoolyard. I would have intrusive thoughts like 'Am I walking right? What if I'm not walking right? Everybody is looking at me! I wanna go away. etc ...' I was depressed and (actively) suicidal. Somehow I survived. n nThe anxiety came in waves. Sometimes the anxiety was less than other times. nnThis year and last year, my anxiety partly went away. I still have it, I'm still insecure, sometimes depressed and anxious, but it's much less than previously. I'll give my two cents and nn*some tips that worked for me.*nnnn**Going to parties.**nYou'll probably want to stop reading now, because it feels impossible to do this, but going to parties has helped me so much with my social anxiety. I remember my first time drunk and at a party. The drunk made me don't care about anything. My anxiety vanished. It was almost euphoric. It made me realize I can be happy, and I can be self-confident. I was very aware it was the alcohol that made me feel this way, but I carried this feeling the next morning. *You can be confident*. Ofcourse it's very dangerous to drink alcohol when you're suffering from a mental disorder, but if you can control it, the benefits may outweigh the cons.nn**Trying and learning little things that make you seem (and feel) more confident.** I remember everyday I walked to school, I would always look at the ground. I was too afraid of eye contact. One day I thought fuck it. I put my earbuds in, turned on good music and began walking with my head up, shoulders up and straight back. Arms to my side and with a smile on my face. The first time it was very hard, but I practiced this everyday while walking to school and after some time I began to do it automatically. It's kind of a thing you need to learn and practice. nn**Doing and practicing things in private you wouldn't do in public**. For example, I'm a bedroom DJ. I'm so afraid to play for an audience, so I DJ for myself. When I DJ, I give everything and I'm dancing like crazy. Things like this will learn to be comfortable with yourself (in private). Many people aren't comfortable with them selves, let alone with other people. nnThe thing that helped me the most is **going to a psychiatrist**. After therapy, she prescribed me **sertraline** (Zoloft). I know many people can't afford it, are against it or are too scared of the side effects, but Sertraline saved my life. One month after taking it, my social anxiety almost completely vanished. I didn't overthink anymore, I wasn't suicidal anymore, I felt normal and happy. I became more self-confident and people started to notice I was happier and more alive. Although I have some pretty annoying side effects, the benefits massively outweigh the cons. nnLastly, **learning abdominal breathing**. This saved me from a lot of panic attacks and hyperventilation attacks. Breathing trough your abdomen requires less muscle power, and you'll get a lot more air from it. It'll also slow down your breathing and heart rate. I've learned and practiced it, and it's a lot easier too breathe now. nnSo, this was my share of advice. If you have questions, let me know :). nn",1

5348,"minocentaur","post","Toughest hurdle left for me even after 7 months therapy, is living with a very nosy mother and fearing judgement.","Background:  nn  I am a 28 year old man still living at home with my parents. Up until about 16 months ago, all I did my whole life was stay at home most days playing computer games all day. I had a ""job"" helping my dad in construction, but was only probably working on average 1\-2 days a week, if that. So I really have nobody to blame but myself for still living at home. Also I haven't had any friends since early high school and have never had a girlfriend nor had sex ever.  I waited way too long to take life seriously.nnSomething inside me finally changed enough to look for a full time job and I found one last year(16 months ago).  So far my progress has been pretty good since I secured this job. I had 4 raises so far, and looking like I will only go up from here with it. nnAfter about 8\-9 months of working full time and  even getting along with most people at work, I still failed to make any friends, mostly due to me declining to hang out with the few that asked me to, due to social anxiety. I decided to seek professional help and worked up the courage to call a therapist/life coach and started my first ever therapy with her.nnCurrent:nnSince going to my therapist, my progress in different areas of my life has drastically improved. I'm in the best physical shape of my life due to sticking with weightlifting(instead of on and off) and doing cardio(which I have never done before). Also I have been eating much more healthy.  I have been meditating at least 5\-10 minutes almost every day and I feel this also helped a lot. Now I feel MUCH less actual anxiety in many different situations. nnHowever, I still feel depressed and lonely many days. Not near as much as I used to, but it's still there. I want to have friends outside of work and want to have a sex life and actually feel like a man and not a kid. I know what I need to do. I need to go out and do things that involve meeting new people, but there's a big hurdle that is so difficult for me to pass. My mother is extremely nosy, to the point where I feel like I can't even have a private life. This alone prevents me from wanting to go out and do something different than my usual routine. My family doesn't know I go to therapy. To them, the days I go to therapy is just ""staying late after work for overtime"". I still greatly fear judgement from my family, mostly my mother.  The combination of fearing judgement and having to live with someone(my mother) who is so nosy that it's impossible to escape their judgement has me at a wall that is very difficult to climb over. Though I feel like if I can conquer this obstacle, it would be a huge turning point in my life.nnThis is mostly a rant, but any advice, questions, or comments are welcome. Maybe someone else is in a similar situation and we can relate and/or help each other out with strategies of how to deal with this.nnTLDR: Made a lot of progress so far with my social anxiety, but having a hard time overcoming the obstacle of having a very nosy mother and fearing judgement. And this I feel is preventing me from making further progress towards making friends and having a sex life and in turn escaping loneliness and the depression that goes with it.",1

Help.","First of all sorry for the long title, I'm not really sure how to shorten it down. nAnd to provide some context, I've never spoken about how I feel to anyone other than the friend I mention below and I don't have a family relationship that's open to sharing, I've just found out today that this one friend has told my parents and other friends without consulting me first, and doesn't know I know they know. (Sorry for awful phrasing).nnSo, for as long as I can remember, (21 now) I've always had these thoughts in my head about why I shouldn't say/ do something I wanted to, no matter how small or insignificant it was. nnAs a result of these thoughts, on countless occasions I've never been able to fulfil what I've wanted to do with my life and have always had to find a workaround. This has led to my depression which has been getting worse and worse, as I would have ideas of things I want to do or something to say in a conversation, but ultimately never doing them because I am controlled by this overwhelming sense of dread and fear. It seems like the smaller the task I can't do, the worse I feel.nnAbout 8 months ago I finally gave up trying to pretend it was all ok. I decided to reach out to one of my closest friends and share with them everything I've been thinking (I wanted to speak to them, but I had to write it all down instead. We share a shared notes on our iPhones where i have written about 50,000 words of my thoughts and feelings). I just wanted someone who knew how I truly felt behind the happy persona I portray, that I could perhaps talk to about my problems and find comfort in knowing there is someone who knows how I actually feel. This escalated a lot from starting to talking to them maybe once every two weeks about how I felt, to everyday for hours crying on their bed. They took me to a specialist and I have been diagnosed with severe social anxiety disorder and severe depression. nnFast forward to now and my depression has been getting worse seemingly everyday. The other day I told my friend I want to die because I cant live with this overwhelming feeling of fear that controls me anymore, and that there's no point of putting on this act of being happy. Behind my back they told my parents about this (which I stated I was really uncomfortable with when they brought up the idea when we first started talking) and now I think about 7 people know about how I've been feeling including my parents and other friends who they have told. nnI don't know whether to feel betrayed that they've done this, as this is the only person I have ever felt comfortable with sharing how I feel and now so many people know who I wouldn't have told personally. I also recently found out my friend keeps on sharing what I write to them with my parents and my parents have been going through my notebooks to see what I have been writing. Should I feel betrayed that they're doing all of this behind my back, or are they just trying do whats best? Now that my parents know how I've been feeling, I can see I've made them upset, and if I never would have said anything 8 months ago, none of this would have escalated (now councillors and mental health professionals are getting involved) and I could've pretended to be fine forever. I feel selfish for putting so much on my friend.nnI'm so lost, and now I feel like I can't talk to who I would consider my best friend (I don't think I'm there's, but that's fine I guess) anymore because of this fear of who else will find out, and that I've lost this sense of sense of confidentiality with them. What do I do? n",1
5380,"Memoryfoam20189","post","Can I ask a question about myself","Hey guys,nnI’m a bit confused about some stuff I’m going through and would really appreciate an honest thought about them, since it can be hard to ask this stuff in person with severe SA. Full disclosure, I smoked weed for the first time in a few years just a few minutes ago, so I’m pretty sure this feeling of terror is always real, it’s just been brought up from a deeper level of consciousness so that I can feel it more acutely rn (&amp; clearly too). nnI’m not sure if I need serious help, or what I should do, or how to life my life. I’m not sure that if I was in this need of help if anyone I know would tell me, since I push literally everyone in my life away. Friends, family, I realize I’ve kept everyone I know closely at arms length for many years (23 now). nnThe weird thing about it is that I don’t isolate myself in general. I go to work where I talk to people, I’m just finishing college and I talk to people at classes &amp; in clubs around, and it doesn’t make me nervous at the surface level, but I’m not sure if I’m actually terrified and I just made myself numb to that to save myself from feeling constantly the terror of anxiety. If this is even anxiety, maybe it’s something worse and there’s something fundamentally wrong/miswired with my brain, maybe it’s just the weed talking, but I feel I have 0 satisfying relationships in my life. Is that what social anxiety does? I have trouble making eye contact comfortably in conversations, listening to what people say, I think I kind of just end up with this dead-eyes stare at people and a rote response that doesn’t completely address what they just said but is just enough to keep the conversation lurching along. I don’t have a diagnosis of anxiety, but I’ve kept myself away from therapists until now since I’ve been convincing myself that classic meds like benzos or SSRIs are a last resort, even after deep meditation and psychedelics. I just completed a 10-day vipassana meditation retreat (~10 hours/day of sitting), and the month following felt socially easier, but still not totally fluid and easy. I’m kind of at a loss, all I really want period is a smooth easy comfortable conversation that doesn’t feel like I’m numb and deaf to what they’re saying/being able to listen. nnBasically I’m totally lost if this is just normal existential young adult stuff or if I’m in serious need of psychiatric help and need someone to be honest with me, or it’s the weed making me think with greater terror (since anxiety doesn’t mix well with weed right) &amp; I’m going to sober up and read this over again like wtf was wrong with me. nnJust feel so alone at the deepest levels of my being and don’t know what to do, if someone could be honest about the degree of normalness/commonality or need of help I’m in it’d mean a lot. nnLike can y’all make easy conversation with eye contact and feel comfortable laughing? Not feel psychologically tensed up 24/7? Isn’t that what normal people should be able to do? Gosh I’m so frustrated from living like this and just want to feel relaxed, unafraid, comfortable, and connected to other human beings",0
5382,"throwaway098337","post","Crippling Public Speaking Anxiety and Anxious Swallowing","Hello everyone...throw away account because some friends know my reddit.nnFirst off, I'm so glad I found this community. And I can't believe I'm about to post this. But anxiety has completely ruined my life. I've sought out all kinds of professional help with no success. My only hope is some insight from you wonderful people. If any of you choose to read the whole thing, I want you to know I'm deeply appreciative, and will do whatever I can to give back to this community on my main account.nnAllow me to explain my story and my anxiety issues:nnI've had bad anxiety throughout my life, and OCD in my younger years. I pretty much grew out of my OCD symptoms (such as clicking, blinking hard, all that kind of stuff) by the time I was in 8th grade. I've had no problems with that ever since.nnHowever, the life ruiner for me has been social/performance anxiety. I went to the hospital for my first panic attack (which I had no clue what it was) when I was in 5th grade. I had panic attacks every other day or so at night for about 2 years. Slowly, I grew out of the nightly panic attacks as well.nnBut the real issues started in junior high school during 7th grade. I was always an outgoing kid and social butterfly. Volunteered to go first for every presentation, always went up on stage during assemblies, and taught Taekwondo classes as a kid. I loved public speaking. Then all the sudden everything changed.nnIt was the second day of 7th grade, and I was in my class. The teacher wanted us to all stand up one by one, and read a paragraph about ourselves to the entire class. Being super outgoing me, I volunteered to go first. As I stood up and started reading, I'll never forget how I felt. All the sudden I started choking up, was shaking, and felt like I was crying. I remember stopping after about 20 seconds and telling the teacher I felt sick and needed to go to the nurse. Cue the judging looks from 20, 13 year olds. Then I left class.nnAs that year went on, every now and then I was pretty nervous for presentations, but read out loud at my desk fine. Fast forward to 8th grade. I had just moved states for my father's job and started attending a new school. On the first day of class, every class I went to we had to stand up and introduce ourselves. I struggled heavily to get through introducing myself to everyone in each class. I didn't know what was going on, but it felt just like the second day of 7th grade. Wanting to cry, shaking terribly, throat feeling like it was closing, all that again.nnRegardless, I still made some good friends. But throughout the year another symptom popped up...I started becoming VERY anxious reading out loud in class at my desk. So now, presentations and reading out loud are the worst experiences ever for me. I remember the first time I got extremely anxious reading out loud in English class. I only read about 15 seconds before I couldn't breath and my voice sounded like I was crying. I stopped and my teacher was looking at me like ""wtf?"" and everyone in class started laughing. I just apologized and she picked someone else to read.nnThroughout 8th grade, my whole year was me doing whatever I could do get out of reading in class...and barely speaking during presentations and getting laughed at during my anxious crying-like speaking. And the worst part about this is, I was and still am a very social and decently known person. I got along with people really well and had a lot of friends. So everyone was constantly really surprised by some of the anxiety I would have, and I was always embarrassed as heck and anxious to go to school.nnNOW for the #1 life ruiner for me...a new symptom starting in 9th grade - Anxious Swallowing. I started ""dating"" this girl ""Jane."" The first time I went out to the movies with her...all of the sudden I felt a strong urge to swallow whenever it was quiet. And my swallowing was LOUD. She kept looking at me every now and then with an odd face. After the movie, it all went away.nnNext time I went to the movies with Jane, the same thing happened again. Any time it was quiet and I was close to her, I'd have to swallow so bad I felt like my throat was closing when I didn't. While trying hard not to swallow, I started getting an anxiety attack and had to get up and leave. I just told her I felt sick.nnThroughout my relationship this swallowing thing continued in those situations. Then, one morning I just woke up, and I was focused on my swallowing. Soon she broke up with me lol.nnFlash forward 7 years later, and I still consciously swallow for about half the day even when I'm not anxious. But in any situation that involves close contact with people while it's quiet (classrooms, waiting rooms, tests, movie theaters) I feel a strong urge to swallow none stop. Many times it gets to the point where my fighting it has given me panic attacks. I've even had people point it out and ask me if I'm alright a few times. If I was in a waiting room and someone was swallowing loud next to me over and over again, I'd probably wonder the same thing.nnNow I even get it talking to new people. If someone comes up to me my heart goes insane and my throat closes. Despite me wanting to say a ton, I only get out a few words before I have to stop so that I don't sound like I'm crying. Approaching women has been pretty tough too because of this. I've had decent luck, but feel like this is ruining me pursuing out of my comfort zone.nnAs you can imagine, these 3 things - public speaking, reading out loud, and anxious swallowing, have literally ruined my life. The swallowing has now even combined with public speaking. So any time I have had to public speak, I'd get the swallowing thing as well, and quite literally just break down and can't talk at all.nnThroughout high school each year I would email my teachers and explain my situation and ask them not to call on me in class or have me do presentations in front of the class. Thankfully pretty much every single one was accommodating. But it's ruined so many opportunities for me. I can't tell you how many classes I've dropped, positions I've avoided, and generic things I've never pursued because of all this.nnNow I've just recently dropped out of college to avoid public speaking and the swallowing in auditorium class rooms for good. I've enrolled into online school, and I am just really unhappy right now. I wish the swallowing and public speaking stuff were at least manageable, but I've been trying to get them under control for years with no success at all.nnPeople say, the more you do it (putting yourself in anxious situations and public speaking) the better it gets. This is not the case for me at all. I tried over and over again for years, and it has literally just gotten worse as I got older.nnMy parents know and have tried to help me. I've sought all kinds of professional help. I've been to several psychologists and therapists who didn't help at all. I've even seen an endocrinologist (I was born with Late-Onset CAH but have since ""cured"" it around 7th grade after taking cortisol tablets every day for 5 years). The psychiatrist on my campus suggested I see the endocrinologist to see if my extreme anxiety may be linked to my Late-Onset CAH. Unfortunately the doctor found no connection at all.nnNow I'm sitting here, having dropped out of a great 4 year university, wondering what's going to happen with my future. I've already been building skills around freelancing so that I won't ever have to public speak. But I know how important it is and want to be able to so badly. And the swallowing symptom is the most traumatic thing in the world for me. If anyone has it, you'll know exactly what I mean.nnNow 20 years old, I'm an outgoing guy who feels trapped. My unimaginably severe anxiety in many situations has left me with very few friends...mostly from my own choosing to distance myself from people, even though I love people.nnSorry for the extremely long post. If you read it, you have my greatest appreciation. I'm just looking for any help or advice I can get. This severe anxiety has ruined everything for me. I'm glad I'm in a decent position right now to make a change, but my anxiety has kept me from doing so. I've tried for almost a decade.nnAny and all advice is welcome. Thanks.nn**TL;DR** Severe public speaking anxiety and anxious swallowing has ruined my life. I've tried everything with no success...looking for advice from others or connecting with others in similar situations.",1
5391,"BrightTap","post","I'm a socially failed person &amp; stopped expecting anything from life","I'm a 21 year old male who is tired of being the socially awkward. Never had any girl in my life. I'm tired of motivating myself any further to make any change. I hate the mere existence of mine.  Because, the world is simply curated for the people who are outgoing, charming, beautiful &amp; popular. I do not have any of these qualities. My life was always like this. When I was a child, my father had developed an intense habit to go physical whenever I did something which doesn't suit his requirements. As I grew a little more, my parents started encouraging me to study hard.  My parents had a simple idea - ""Son, study as much as you can and you will be successful &amp; respected in the society"".  I did as I was asked to do. As a result, my performance in academics improved significantly. I started racking up straight A's in my school.  I then wanted to socialize. But my parents had the idea that socializing with other kids will spoil my studies.  I never resisted my parents wish and sacrificed everything for my progress in the academics. It was enough to please parents, teachers &amp; friends.nnI made few friends back in school. But it was never mutual. I tried to help others grow with the knowledge I had &amp; helped them in their worst times. But, I was always taken advantage of. I had no clue what is wrong. I was lost in sharpening my intellectual skills. I skipped every public events in the school. I then felt something is missing in my life. I felt jealous of those outgoing kids who were popular &amp; their friend circle. I couldn't even approach any girl I like. Though I had earned formal respect  from everyone due to my studious nature. I was terrified to show them real me. I didn't even knew how to respond to a girl who is giving me a clear signal that she is interested. On some occasions girls approached me. But my lack of confidence ruined any progress in this department. I was depressed. Everything was falling apart. As a result, I wasn't able to get into any top college. I got into an average college. nnObviously, my parents were not happy. They started blaming this to my lack of interest in study. Once again, I started the same mechanical procedure of studying due to parental pressure. I loved Advanced Calculus. So, I attracted some selfish bastards as my friends. Initially, I thought they are nice &amp; cooperating &amp; I enjoyed my 1st year at college with them.  But, I was wrong. Friends turned out to be abusive assholes.  Our professor had given us a project &amp; made groups of 5 individuals. I was with my friends. It was me who did everything on the project &amp; they take the credit for the things which I've done. When I resisted, I was abused. I was called psychopath &amp; someone who could never get any girl in his life. I'm fed up with the manipulation and mental game. I considered them friends but they are manipulating my needs of social exposure. nnFor all of this, I blame that I listened to my parents and became a study machine from an early age. If I had developed the social skills from an early age. I could've read the verbal, non-verbal &amp; manipulation cues very well. I tried to improve my situation. I tried reading books on Human Psychology, Female Brain, Sociology. I tried ""do not give a fuck what others think"". But none worked in the real world. ""Fake it till you make it"" made the matters rather worse. Because my insecure Body Language and Eye Contact exposes the real me. Those friends started calling me a loser, impersonator and insulting in every other way possible. I'm suffering with confidence issue and need of approval from others. Don't know how to respond to insults. No one takes me serious. nnI'm not proud of my skinny &amp; slouchy posture. Body language is yet another issue from me. Some people told me that my eye contact is giving them creeps. I do not have a bit of emotional intelligence. My friends, parents, siblings have called me a psychopath once in my life. I do not know.  I helped everyone of them and care about them. But, I get abuse &amp; insults in return. I'm seeing hot girls falling for stupid guys who have no idea about what they want in life and here I'm forever virgin in my 21 years of life. I like computer programming and passionate about computers in general. I'm currently in the Final year of Bachelors degree in Computer Science.nnI am not expecting any job opportunities. It is obvious. No one will give a job to a psychopath &amp; emotionally weak individual. Even If I get any job, I will most likely be placed in a  corner seat. I will be treated as a Code Monkey. I will be manipulated. All the managerial, administrative &amp; decisive positions will be taken by individuals who're confident and are doing socially well. There will not be any place for me. Now, I realized that I was wrong. It was never about knowledge. It was always about social skills, peoples, connection and networking. I'm not seeing any improvement in my life. I became habitual of the insults. I'm just going with the flow. Life really has nothing to offer to a guy like me. Everything is an illusion. Death is the ultimate truth. Why bother about life? Now it is too late. Nothing can be changed. Honestly, I stopped developing myself any further for career and life in general. I'm fed up with everything. ",0

I’m sick and tired of it, literally, this anxiety is physically and mentally exhausting. I wish it wasn’t a struggle to just get up in the morning, that just a simple fracking hello leaves me with hours of unease and regret that I did it wrong. Yeah, yeah, call me crazy, call me irrational, but frick, it’s real and I’ve dealt with it almost every day since I can remember. People tell me that I shouldn’t just say “I wish this” and “I wish that” and that I should just get over it or do something about it. One, frack you guys who say “just get over it”, you’ve probably never dealt with anxiety, it’s like you are carrying the weight of everyone’s judgements and eyes on you with every possibility of any and every event running through your head all the time. It’s traumatic and we live with it everyday and in the end some of us can’t take it any longer, we can’t stand the pressure of living under the umbrella of our own minds. Two, you think I’m not dealing with it? I’ve done therapy, I’ve had over half a dozen different therapists and psychologists, I’ve done the meds and meditation and I still spent over half my junior year of high school locked in my bedroom crying and trying not to end it while my mother thought I just had mono and was “tired”. I am trying, I force myself outside and to interact but it’s terrifying and people just don’t seem to get that. When you’ve lived your whole life with these voices in your head telling you that you’re useless, you’re worthless, that no one likes you or that you’ll mess everything up, it’s hard to just shut it out. They echo all the time; you want to go out for ice cream, they’ll tell you people will think your ice cream choice is weird or you’ll drop the cone all over you or on someone else. Rinse wash and repeat with any and every social situation.nnYeah I’m getting better, I’m moving forward. I haven’t ended it, but frack man, it just takes one bad look, one simple “freak” or “weirdo” uttered under someone’s breath that sends me spiraling right back down to that dark place. So yeah, I wish I could just not give a frack about what people think or say but I can’t. I’m still a work in progress and at the moment that’s all I have to give.",1
5396,"catastrofeet","post","Various social issues","Hello! I have been ""shy"" all my life and more recently I have had increasing difficulties speaking with people due to extreme anxiety. For example, I need to ask my boss a question at his desk. I will think over what I need to ask beforehand, and get nervous about it. I remind myself, ""it's no big deal"" and then proceed to walk over to his desk. I get his attention and start talking but as I am talking, I start to get nervous, forget how to form a sentence, get nervous that I am stumbling over the sentence/stuttering, get nervous that I am turning red which in turn makes me stumble even more, etc. At this point there's no hope for a conversation because I'm already in nervous mode/forgetting how to even talk. I don't remember having this problem until after high school (I'm 25 now).n  nMy second problem is with conversation flow. I have problems thinking of things to say to get the conversation going. Instead I end up with roadblocks. I do understand how to make a conversation flow with open-ended questions but I can never think of anything in the moment, probably due to nerves. I am also very self-centered, admittedly, so thinking about the other person's feelings is difficult for me. n  nMy third problem which is also a more recent issue is stuttering/stumbling on words because of memory issues, probably anxiety-related. I often struggle to form a coherent sentence, often forgetting what words to use. Then the nervousness sets in and it gets worse. Because I have this issue, I avoid conversation because I know it will come up and I will embarrass myself. When I'm talking I often look away from the person so I can think better. I have a very difficult time explaining things. Again, a more recent problem. I was always shy in school but never remember having these problems. n  nI made a friend at work so that ups my friend count to 2 (seriously). One of them used to be my best friend but we rarely hang out so I am often uptight around her and she even picked up on it. We don't really have much in common anymore and i feel I will probably lose her. I don't have a true best friend that I really get along with anymore. I do have a guy friend at work but I don't think it would be an option to hang out with him ever since he has a girlfriend. We get along really well and have a lot in common. I need/want to make more friends due to increasing loneliness and boredom but don't know where/how to find these relationships. My friend at work came to me instead of me seeking her out. n  nI have thought about going to a concert or cafe with live music playing to find friends. Maybe I could find them at a bar, but that's not my thing since I don't drink. I'm not in college, I don't go to church anymore, so those big social outlets aren't available. I play piano but that's a personal hobby and not something I could turn into a social opportunity, unless I start giving lessons (I'm actually giving my friend from work lessons). I don't have any kids to socialize with moms. I never had any interest in clubs or sports. I do like nature/hiking but can't really meet people through there unless I pay for a parks &amp; rec program.n  nA final note: I have tried medication but I don't like the way I am while taking them. And the various side effects. I have tried a few therapists but honestly I feel like I just need someone to talk to, a friend. When I make friends and have fulfilling experiences, I will truly be happy.n  nTl;dr This is mostly a rant but I am just in a funk trying to find friends as a 25y/o but can't find the opportunities and struggle with persistent nerves when speaking, which deters me from any progress.

5409,"Mental-Bee-6984","post","Can anyone please help me?","I am a 17 year old girl. I have so much insecurities about my looks for example my skin, forhead, nose, lips etc... nnIt started with my nose that I hated since I was a child that I would cry because I didn't like it. But in recent years since I started high-school my insecurities increased. nnWhen I was 14 years old I remember sitting in my bed and crying because of my nose, and my imperfect skin. So months later I started living in a fantasy world where all my insecurities were fixed, my nose was smaller, skin tone was even, my hair was thicker and healthier etc. At first it was something I did once in a while but then it increased it became almost an addiction. I would spend hours everyday where I close the lights in the room lower the temperature, lock my door and play really loud music while I pace around my room, escaping into my fantasy world. I feel so amazing when I daydream it feels so real for me. The problem is that now my insecurities increased, especially that I can detach from my body so easily. I don't look in the mirror for days, I sometimes can't shower for a whole week not because I am dirty but because I don't like the fact that my skin tone is not the same everywhere and because it is not perfect. I can't study well because whenever I try to come to real life I feel so sad because I feel like I am crazy for living in a fantasy world I feel so bad and so much regret and this makes me want to escape life again. nnBut this had also made me lose my concentration and I literally don't remember anything at all. I don't even know what I am saying, I forget things that I did in the past and where I placed stuff etc. If u can see how messy this post is it is literally how my brain worksnnAnother problems is that I literally keep remembering the bad things that happened to me all the time when I am in the real worldnnI believe that I have two faces my pretty face and my ugly face my pretty face is skinnier and with a smaller nose etc.. I feel when my face is the pretty one so I can look in the mirror and can be more productive and confident. But when I have my not pretty face I feel so down and I can't do anything, I can't go out in public, I sometimes cancel going out or feel so nervous and scared. I once was so nervous to go to a party that I started crying in the car. I am so sure about the pretty face thing because even my father noticed and he told me that my face looks different during not pretty face period and during my pretty face period after days later he told me that my face got smaller.nnI try to fake it and act normal when I am with others so no one knows that I suffer every single second of my life. Especially that I go out during my pretty face times so I am more confident and they don't notice.nnI am determined to have a nose job, I even chose my surgeon. I feel like I will be happier after my nose job.nnI hate cameras so much, I don't like taking pictures and videos or look at old photos at all. I rarely take selfie and they are mostly through specific angles. I don't like opening cameras in online classes, and if I had cameras open I feel so nervous and my heart keeps beating for the whole class. I hate going out because of cameras.nnI feel so embarrassed by my daydreams but to be honest they make me happy.nnMy fantasy world reached a point where I would lie about things that happened to me in real life but they actually haven't. I sometimes believe what happens in my dream world. I am literally addicted to my fantasy worldnnI am even scared to show my face in public, especially after the masks thingnnNowadays I don't have this as much thankfully but last year for many many months I had sleep paralysis and nightmares almost every night.nnI can only look in the mirror if I pinched my nose every few seconds to make it look smaller. I have only seen my nose unpinched only 2 times maybe in the past years. I know it is terrible but I really don't like my natural nose. I also have to smile a certain way because I don't like the way my lips look when I have a straight face. Looking in the mirror has so much rituals for me.nnI also don't like my feet and that is why I wear socks all day so that not me or anyone can see them.nnI also don't like real life because I feel so alone and scared, unlike in my fantasy world.nnI sometimes feel suicidal and have urges to cut, I brought a knife and placed it in my wrist multiple times but I thankfully didn't actually cut, I also feel like if I started cutting it will make marks in my skin and people would know aswell as ruin my skin and make me even more insecure about it.nnMy fantasy world seems so real to the point that I once cried so bad when one of the people in my world died. I love my characters so much, because they actually help me, unlike in real life where I don't have anyone to tell.nnI am about 100lbs and people tell me that I am skinny but I rarely see myself as so. I know that I am skinny but I don't feel it. I don't believe I have an eating disorder because my whole diet consists of sodas and sugars and I don't really care as much. I don't like salads and vegetables and I rarely cook because it also puts me.in real lifennI keep getting these moments when I feel so nervous and scared for no reason and start to cry. I have no idea why nnI had tried to meditate and pray but I can't for many days because it makes me go into reality and it feels scary for me.nnI get intrusive thoughts about my looks all the time. Like for example my brain tells me that I will never be pretty enough. And when I see models my brain tells me that I will never be like them.nnI am tearing up now and I honestly didn't tell anyone about this, I told my parents that I needed therapy but they won't let me go to because they don't think there is anything wrong with me. Also both my parents are doctors and my mom would tell me (since I was young) that if I had any problems I should tell her. I do tell her about almost everything except this thing because it's embarrassing and she also has her own problems so I don't want to worry her. I dont want to self diagnose but I can't go to a psychiatric or psychologist, so does anyone know what should I do. I really want to become better but I am scarednnI don't care about my looks for other people but mostly to myself because I know that most people are not perfect and I honestly don't understand how they are OK about this, I feel like I should be perfect in every aspect, looks, education, clothing etc..",0
5411,"thegreatrave","post","just need to rant","I just really really need to get this off my chest - social anxiety is the absolute worst and I feel like my life is being robbed from me because of it. there's nowhere near enough recognition of SA in society and I don't think many people truly understand how debilitating it can be. I'm 23 and I feel like the best years of my life have just passed me by. I don't have the social experiences that my peers have and as I get older the discrepancy continues to increase. the gap is now so large that I don't even really feel my age. I got my university degree without attending parties, going out, dating, doing any of the things people usually do which help them to build up a sense of self/identity. I feel alienated from the rest of the world. there are so many things I want to do but can't. I've tried SSRIs but none were helpful. I've tried CBT and didn't notice any effect. exposure therapy is a grey area as most of my life probably falls under this category - having to attend classes, workshops, pracs, go to the shops etc, answer the door, talk to cashiers or whoever, make small talk at unavoidable gatherings like family events. yet despite how often I have to do things that trigger my anxiety, it's gotten no better. I dread contemplating my future because I just don't see things improving for me and if my life progresses as it has, I don't see how I could ever be fulfilled in myself or live a happy life. if I ever let myself dwell too long on the milestones I've missed out on or the development I've failed to achieve I feel disgusted with myself and hopeless, so for the most part I just avoid thinking about it. I'm in med school and starting my clinical rotations next year and just the thought makes me sick. the ward visits I've had so far were awful, I was sweaty and trembling and at many occasions had to lean against something or grab at a table for support as I felt so unsteady on my feet. I suspect that I'll get through it like I have everything else in my life, but it's going to completely sap at my energy and self esteem and at the end of it when I have to practice as a doctor I know my anxiety is going to be even worse. I've had guys that were interested in me but none stuck around for long, probsbly because once they actually started to get to know me they realised I can't hold a conversation to save my life and have no social life. SA is this huge immobilising block in my life that I wish to God I could just obliterate but I have a feeling it's going to stick around for good. the worst part is that even if I do manage to get over the anxiety aspect, my social skills themselves are non existent - even when I'm drunk my conversations are awkward. so it's not even a case of this wonderful personality being trapped inside the cage of anxiety, it's the long haul of somehow overcoming my anxiety and then starting the work of forming social skills. I already have chronic fatigue and I just don't think I'll ever have the energy for it. maybe I'll end up burning out at some point and ending up alone and on government payments, I don't know. anyway, I don't think many people will read this but if anyone does I'm very grateful to you for sitting through my Saturday night wallowing and I hope your story is less fatalistic than mine. my heart goes out to everyone who suffers from SA and I hope that in future better treatment options are formulated because I don't really agree that exposure is the best or only way to go for a lot of people, I suspect there's a neurochemical component as well. anyway. I'm slightly drunk which is the only reason I was brave enough to post this. I'm going to trawl through this subreddit looking for success stories to hopefully spark some hope for myself. or maybe stories of people going through something similar to me so I feel less alone",1

5432,"Auronas","post","Social Event Review - Dinner with 5 - went terribly","**Diagnosis**: I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder in 2012 but I guess you could say I have had problems with social situations my entire life. nn**Treatments**: I have had CBT on and off these six years and try and follow the self help guides when I am not in sessions. I know it's going to take a long time to see any progress, to rewrite my thought processes and I haven't given up yet. However, recently, things have been getting worse and I'm starting to forget what it's like to have a successful social situation. In terms of medication I have been prescribed Fluoxetine, Setraline and paroxetine. None have made any difference to how I think, act or behave in social situations. nn**Event**: As part of my therapy, I am encouraged to engage in social situations and so when this opportunity (an evening out with four old flatmates) came up I took it. Which I suppose in itself is some small victory. nnI tried to enact techniques from my therapy such as, if you can't think of anything to say then ask a question, the problem was that as soon as I asked anyone a question (how's the gf, have you finished your masters etc.?) they would give a one word answer and immediately turn back to the ""funny banter"" of the group. I honestly could not think of a thing to say to add to these funny anecdotes, my brain was whizzing at break neck speed but for some reason, like always, nothing would come to me. It is honestly fascinating to me how things seem to automatically come to people, line after line spilling out of them effortlessly. My mind turns into a blank slate. nnWhen everyone except one person went to the loo I tried to talk the remaining guy but he gave a one word answer, yawned and then pulled out his phone. I couldn't really think of something truly genuine and engaging to say chit chat wise like everyone else. When everyone returned he quickly shoved his phone back in his pocket and became energetic again. It is honestly shocking how boring I am. All the while I am starting to burn up inside and get that anxious sick feeling. Overall apart from my run of the mill questions I have added nothing to the dialogue of the group for the entire night.nnSomeone draws attention to my silence by asking if there is something wrong with me as I haven't spoken. When we leave everyone is given an emotional farewell except me who is given a curt bye. Understandable as I contributed nothing to the fun of the night. nnWhen I get home I try and use my CBT to ""post process"" the situation i.e. he was yawning because he was tired not because I was boring him, he was looking at his phone because he had received an important text, they gave a curt goodbye to me because they were deep in conversation etc.nnI still feel sick to my stomach though. I'm not even sure why I wrote this, I suppose as a distraction from doing something drastic because I want the anxiety to end. nnI truly despise myself because my performance in social situations has destroyed every aspect of my life (family, friends, relationships, employment, hell even shopping brings me anxiety). This event is simply another to add to the pile of events (which is every social event) that has gone wrong. Keep going to these things my therapist says; things will get better. I smile when he says this but I know it will be easier to will blood from a stone.  ",1

This past year or so has been stressful, surprising and somewhat wild at times. I've talked to people about different pieces of this story but I don't think that any one person knows everything which is why I am writing it here and because I don't have anybody that I trust enough or am comfortable enough to tell everything to. I don't really know where to start so I think I'll just write this in pieces with different headings since I think that'll be easiest. I think I will put everything in a somewhat chronological order since that will probably be easiest to read :)nn&amp;#x200B;nn# The BreakupnnSometime in early August of last year, from what I remember, a girl (who I'll call ""A"" from now on) that I had sort of been with for a little bit over a year broke up with me. This wasn't the first time she had broken up with me so by then I was used to it. But for some reason this time felt different and I don't really know why. An important thing to know about the relationship between me and A is that her parents never liked me which was important to her but, being younger and dumber than I am now, I thought things would still be ok even with that but, as you can imagine, they weren't. For some reason she was still ok with trying to be together and continue talking or whatever but it always ended in either her getting in trouble for it or her breaking up with me for a little bit and then sort of getting back together with me and then her getting in trouble again and that whole process starting over again. I realize how unhealthy this was for me because she probably broke up with me around 10-15 times at least. I became unbothered by whether or not she was breaking up with me. I just sort of went with the flow and when she wanted to get back together I would or if she made it seem like she wanted me to pursue her I would. I know that sounds really stupid and I definitely played a huge part in letting that happen to me and doing things that kept it from stopping, if that makes sense. Anyways, that whole summer pretty much had been spent at my sister's house where I had to help watch her kids all day which was a bit of a struggle since they were both under 2 and I had to watch them for most hours of the day and only got about 1 meal a day because they hardly ever bought groceries that I was 'allowed' to use. So eventually this kind of made my social anxiety worse and being at my sister's house in general was somewhat tense because of issues she was having with her kids and husband that had to do with her post postpartum depression. I decided to leave a week or so earlier than I had planned to come back home because it had become too stressful for me and of top of that I would get to see A again if I went back home, since my sister lives pretty far away from where I live. Now that I'm finally back to the main point of this part (I'm sorry if any of that was rambling but I think it was pretty important and I want to get it out) which is the break up, I like to think that I dealt with it pretty well compared to how I deal with other things sometimes. When school started back up me and A saw each other everyday for the first week because of homeroom and by the end of the week we were talking again. I then found out she was sort of talking to a new guy who I had been kind of friends with since I was 6 or 7 years old. She had mentioned him during the summer and just said they had been texting and it seemed like a friend thing so I didn't really worry or think much of it. Until sometime this year I never really thought about it much but I realized that at some point when they were talking that summer she must have told him that me and her were no longer a thing because during the following school year he said some stuff to me/about me that didn't make sense until I realized that because he just saw me as trying to cockblock him and fuck up his chances, which is somewhat reasonable from his perspective. I don't really know how to feel about this even after all this time because I guess it was cheating sort of but I don't really know if it technically or not so I don't know if it should bother me. nn&amp;#x200B;nn# The DrinkingnnAs the school year continued the issues between me and A increased. Her talking to the other boy caused her to stop talking to me and get angry at me more often. At the time, and I really hate saying this, I didn't have any real friends, and I never really had I guess, who I could talk to about the whole situation between me and her. I think that is why I was still always there for her and ready to get back together or still going after her if she seemed like that's what she wanted. Some time during the middle of last fall I started drinking. At first it wasn't a lot. Just maybe one or two nights a week. It quickly changed into me drinking during the day at the same frequency. It was nicer to drink during the day because then it was easier for me to socialize. Not long after that it became me drinking 3-4 times a week during the day. I don't really know how long I kept doing that. Maybe a month or month and a half which isn't too bad but I mean drinking during the day/at school isn't really a smart thing to do. The fall turned into winter and eventually A broke up with me again. By now that number had to be at 20 or so. This time was the weekend before Thanksgiving break while I was with my dad's family for Thanksgiving, which was the second time she had broken up with me on a holiday haha. I barely even cared because it had become so common. After that I don't think I ever talked to her again, at least from what I remember. She never knew about my drinking because I avoided her when I was drunk since she was very against drugs/drinking and she had gotten me in trouble with something similar that I told her. nn&amp;#x200B;nn# The Other DrugsnnAfter the final breakup near Thanksgiving, I quit drinking and I was just kind of happy. It was nice to not have to worry about A for real this time. Christmas started getting closer and I began taking Xanax, Adderall, and Vyvanse because I could get them all for pretty cheap compared to what I could get them for before. I met some new friends at a school thing and I actually started hanging out with them in late December. The first few times I couldn't even think about going to hang out without taking a lot of Adderall first. It took everything about my social anxiety away. For the first time since I was a kid, I had friends. Actual people who wanted to be around me and found me funny and cool. I didn't have to worry about what they thought, I didn't have to be scared of meeting new people, I didn't even have to think twice about what I wanted to say. Adderall took all of those worries and fixed them and I thought it made me a better person. Christmas break ended and we were back in school and for once I was enjoying it since I actually had real friends for once. Exams came not long after and I was taking and selling more Adderall and Vyvanse than I was before Christmas break which makes sense of course. After exams, some bad experiences being too stimmed out during them, and the decrease in people doing Adderall/Vyvanse I quit doing them for the most part. During December there were a few times where I took too much Xanax in school and blacked out and ended up doing some pretty stupid stuff and some rather dangerous and reckless things, in and out of school, which I luckily never got in trouble for. Luckily I never hurt anyone or myself during a blackout either.nnAs the second semester began I started vaping more too and eventually I became pretty addicted to it and in a way it also helped my anxiety but also hurt it in some ways. In the second semester I ended up in a few classes with a lot more of my new friends. I was really excited about this but looking back on it this probably hurt me more than I realized at the time. When I was around them we would sort of encourage each other to do stupid things as kids do I guess. We ended up all doing Xanax pretty often. I don't really know how bad it was for some of my friends since we're not that close anymore but from what I remember or can gather from pictures there was at least two or three weeks where I went through at least 10-15 bars (2mg per bar and for most people a bar is enough to make them black out with no tolerance for those that don't know)  a week, which I only took on weekdays since I would take it to get rid of anxiety and then end up taking more during the day, on my own or possibly more since I was selling them too and probably took some of those as well. I don't remember a lot from that time since most of it was spent asleep or blacked out. About a week before I decided to quit using Xanax since I realized I had at the very least a small problem with it, I was invited to spend the night at a friend of a friend's house. The day I went over there was the first time I smoked weed. Later that night me and two of the other guys there ended up doing lines of Valium and we had a pretty good night. The next day the friend's house who we were at was having his girlfriend over and he asked me to stay since she was bringing a friend and I decided to since I kind of had to so he'd have a wingman or whatever. I thought it was sort of what I was supposed to do. The girls came over and me and my new friend bought more Valium and me and him snorted ours so it would feel stronger and the girls just took theirs. I pretty faded after the Valium and I didn't know what to do so I just went along with the making out and everything with the girlfriend's friend. We never had sex but there was just like some stuff going on. It makes me feel sort of weird to think about since it feels like I was just a little too messed up to try and get out a situation I didn't want to be in. I don't think I was raped or anything because that's clearly not what happened but I feel like I was maybe taken advantage of in a way and nobody really takes me seriously when I talk about it since I'm a guy and I don't know why it still sort of bothers me and I don't know how to deal with it. But anyways other than that I slowed down on taking Xanax that week and my friends all decided to quit sort of together. That next Friday night, which was two days before from my birthday, me and one of my, at the time, best friends took maybe 2 and a half bars each and then we quit for real together. nn&amp;#x200B;nn# Getting CaughtnnA week after my birthday my best friend's mom got into his phone and saw our friends group' groupchat and she told all of our parents. That afternoon me, my best friend, and his other best friend were all sitting in a doctor's office getting an intervention talk from like half of our parents and maybe 4 or 5 doctors. We all got piss tested and had to watched during it which was sort of weird. It was my first time getting an intervention talk even though I had been caught with drugs by my parents twice before. The rest of that day was spent by getting yelled at by my parents. They told me I had to go to choose between: a new school, getting a mental evaluation at a drug counseling facility (which I have had one of at the ER before which is why I didn't take this option), or I could go to therapy. I decided therapy would be the easiest so I went with that. I lost all pretty much all my privileges pretty much. I couldn't see my friends (which hurt me more than it had the other times I had gotten in trouble because this time I had friends I could hang out with), I couldn't use my phone, I couldn't have cash with me or have any money in my bank account anymore, and I couldn't use my laptop even for school work. Before getting caught I had also found a guy who could ship me stuff from a state where weed is legal if I sent him money for it. I don't even really remember how I got the money, looking back on a lot of this I'm not really sure how I got the money for a lot of stuff I was either too high to remember or selling any drugs I had to get other ones, but before too long me and a few of my friends had ordered some stuff from him and things definitely weren't as bad as they had been before but it still wasn't good for us. After a month or so I was allowed to hang out with some of my friends again. After getting caught I had also started drinking every once in a while when my friends could get me liquor they could give away. I probably never spent more than a week and a half sober from January until June. Pretty much all of my friends quit using basically all pills back when we quit Xanax but we still drank, smoked weed, ate edibles, vaped, and used thc pens way too often still. From what I can remember me and maybe one or two other friends would occasionally do pills together if we felt like it but it was nowhere near as often as it had been before. nn&amp;#x200B;nn# Falling off The Golf CartnnAt the very end of May I was hanging out with the guy who was my best friend at the time. We were just hanging out in his neighborhood and at the pool and driving around on his golf cart. I asked him if I could drive it since I had never driven one before and he let me. I drove it wayyy too fast and fell off it while I was driving it and it ran me over in the process and I got a ton of road burn on my leg that was kind of deep. I hid it from my parents because I was scared of getting in trouble or being accused of being on something when it happened. I could barely walk about 6 hours after it happened and I decided I had to tell my parents two days later when it wasn't getting better. When I told them I lied and said my friend was driving when it happened and they believed me and after I was a little better and could walk a little bit more they wouldn't let me hang out with the friend it happened with because they blame him for it which is pretty much why he's no longer my best friend and we just don't talk anymore. Even though it's been almost 3 months my leg is still pretty fucked up looking but it doesn't hurt that much anymore. A lot of my other friends kind of stopped talking to me too since I had to tell them I couldn't hang out since I couldn't walk easily for like 3-4 weeks after falling off the golf cart and I think they thought it was just an excuse.nn&amp;#x200B;nn# Senior YearnnLike I said at the top of this post I start my senior year on Monday. I'm really nervous about it because I haven't really been in school and been sober at the same time in a while. Also all summer I haven't done many drugs which I know is good for me but now I just don't know how to cope with going back to school and being around so many people since this whole summer I've either been alone at home or at my sister's for a few weeks. I'm also kind of sad about applying for college because it feels like nobody is proud of me or happy for me about it except for my sister. I told my parents that I was applying to a few places and they basically just said ""Oh that is good"" and not much else. I know it's not a huge deal but I was kind of excited about it and it feels like that's what they wanted from me this whole time I've been in high school and I finally took the first step to doing it and they don't even seem that proud of it. Also I've only been home for like a week after going to my sister's and we've already gotten in to two arguments over the stupidest things which just makes me feel like they really don't want me here and just want to cause problems with me which I have felt for kind of a while because just since January they have threatened to kick me out like 4 or 5 times which I get isn't that bad and it could be worse but it still makes me feel bad. nn&amp;#x200B;nnIf you made it all the way to the end that you so much for reading all of that. I hope it was somewhat interesting to read. If anybody has any advice or help they want to give me I would love it because tbh right now I don't have a ton of reliable friends to talk to or help me out. And if anyone has any questions about what I said you can ask me because I know some of my writing probably is somewhat confusing and possibly long winded. Hope y'all have a great day :) ",1

5469,"QuietCat30","post","I need advice please. I'm going through hard times and I need a change"," nnI'm trying to decide whether or not I should go see a doctor for anxiety. I have pretty bad social anxiety which is 75% physical symptoms and 25% mental symptoms I'd say. Every time I speak out loud in class my voice shakes uncontrollably, my heart beats extremely fast, I sweat sometimes to the point where it's visible through my shirt, and my mind just goes blank. This is not just a speaking out loud in class issue, the symptoms are just much worse in that scenario, it happens in small groups, and sometimes when talking to family members such as my brother.nnIt's not solely social anxiety. Lately I've been losing hours of sleep every night worrying about my future, I wake up in the middle of the night with a pit in my stomach, the same feeling I get before a big presentation. This is very hard for me to describe with words but I think about every single scenario for my future in my head and play it through endlessly and there's no stop button. This has been a new thing, it's only been going on for about a week now and I feel like it's anxiety because of my social anxiety. I'm scared I'll never have anyone to settle down with, I'm scared to continue growing up, living, and dying alone. This shit has got me into such a bad head space I've been punching posts to make my knuckles bleed, I burnt my foot on purpose, and dug into my leg with my finger nail which is still bleeding 12 hours later, all impulsively.nnMy point is I feel like this all stems from social anxiety, and with my childhood friends off to college I feel so fucking lonely. My friends have been able to make new friend groups where they are, but I'm back at home in community college unable to do anything more than small talk with one person at a time where sometimes my voice trembles and they think I'm weird. I know practice makes it better, and I believe I have made big improvements with my social anxiety mentally in the last month, but physically I'm still a wreck and it's just debilitating to try to have a convo then my voice starts shaking.nnI've been doing research and I saw a medication called ""Propranolol"". It pretty much helps with the physical symptoms of anxiety which sounds perfect for me. I've never been to a doctor, and I've never been diagnosed with anything professionally so I'm not really sure what to do, can I just schedule an appointment somewhere and ask the doctor to prescribe me propranolol? Do you guys think Propranolol is a good idea? my goal is to one day overcome social anxiety, so do you think propranolol could help me build confidence mentally then eventually able to ween off of it without the physical symptoms anymore? I just want to overcome social anxiety, I've seen people on other subs say medication is the easy way out or it's not a long term solution, but I'd happily trade ten years off of my life for a life free of physical anxiety symptoms. Thank you very much for reading and replying :)nnOther notes: If I use my Mom's insurance card will she see that I went to the doctor and got meds? My whole family is the opposite of anxious, they can talk and present to anyone, if they saw this I feel like I'd get laughed at.nnI'm 19 and need a job.

5479,"aprvdc","post","Tightness of mouth (mouth trembling) social anxiety issues","Hey guys.nnSo i've been having this issue for the past 3 years and has progressively gotten worse as time goes by. I'm a naturally socially anxious person however i am confident and fun most of the time depending on the situation. Just some info about me if someone wants to help diagnose this problem.nnI am a 22 year old male, I am fit, have a lot of hobbies, a lot of goals and am very driven. However this issue is holding me back in so many ways that i am starting to miss out of a lot of good times and opportunities and i'm only getting older, and this problem doesn't seem to be going.nn&amp;#x200B;nnAll started 3 years ago at a group job interview. I was in a group of people sitting at a table and we were going around taking turns introducing ourselves to the group and why we wanted the job.  immediately  after the Boss at the table told us this is what we would be doing, my heart sank and straight away started having a rapid heartbeat and being extremely nervous. When it came to my turn to talk i said a few words confidently and then straight away completely froze, it literally stopped mid sentence and could not physically open my mouth. i then covered my mouth looked down and just said ""yeah thats it"" while making no sense at all. nnI have always had a case of social anxiety in the past but i was still always able to go to social settings anyway and feel confident talking after a while of being in the setting. However ever since that moment i have this weird mouth tremble/twitch. And have also developed so many weird social phobias since that time ( in my head i know they are wack but my body automatically gets scared so then my mind gets scared and all just goes down hill) Some fears i have now include, being scared to handshake good mates because i'm scared of screwing it up and it being awkward? This literally has stopped me from even wanting to see my friends because im that worried of this happening. I had this one really awkward handshake with a workmate and from then on its always in the back of my mind now and makes every bloody handshake a nightmare now. This also happens with girls as i'm worried if i should go for a hug or just a kiss on the cheek, things like this give me extreme anxiety and for some reason its engraved in my mind to avoid these situations now.nnAnother example was my 20th birthday party i had with my family. When came time to take photos and cut the cake while everybody was looking at me i had an uncontrollably mouth twitch which stopped me literally smiling. i could not open my mouth and smile without my mouth spazzing out, its literally the worst feeling i have  experienced . And now i have fears of having birthday parties again or having my photo taken, its literally in the back of my mind all the time but in the past i had no issues like this before and loved taking photos! This same issue also happens when speaking to people face to face while standing particularly close to each other, (even with close friends and family!) out of no where i will start getting really self conscious about my mouth and all i can focus on is them looking at me and just freeze up or my mouth started trembling again.nnOver the years i have made some good progress and discoveries in trying to beat this however im still in need of help if anyone can provide me with some possible solutions. I will list some of my thoughts below. I know this is all a big read and might not make some sense to people but if anyone has knowledge that could help me i would be forever grateful.nn&amp;#x200B;nn&amp;#x200B;nn\- I have realized that the mouth twitch comes along with increased adrenaline eg getting really excited or nervous. The mouth twitch also happens when i laugh a lot, i will then feel a crazy tightness around my mouth and will just start feeling super awkward, almost like i cant move my mouth naturally anymore.  And yes i do know all the breathing tricks however when im super nervous it just simply doesnt work.nn\- i have seen a psychologist about this issue and when trying to trigger it, it would never happen though. Even when talking to me really close face to face. I think its because i felt completely safe in that room?nn\- When i hold a smile for a while the twitch will start happening even if i feel completely relaxednn\- 10 mg of propranolol does help it immensely with pre situation fear and does feel like the twitch is less likely to happen. however mouth still feels tight when really nervous.nn\- The only time when i can remember being totally confident in speaking to anyone is when i have alcohol, pretty much all my social anxiety goes away.nnI now have a straight phobia of going to social events, cafes, restaurants etc because i am not able to speak properly when i'm socially anxious now and literally cant talk. I realize i have social anxiety issues that need to be addressed however the one thing i would love some insight on is why my mouth muscles feel so damn tight all the time/ feels like i cant talk properly anymore and will just start twitching. If my facial muscles just felt relaxed a good amount of anxiety would just go away i reckon..nn&amp;#x200B;nn&amp;#x200B;",1

Since then, I've done nothing but lose friends, and my teen years were basically nonexistent. Instead of manning up and pushing forward, I took the cowards route and retreated inside my shell and stayed in there, but it's not working for me, and never really has, I just haven't stepped up and taken steps to actually mend any fences. nnThe most ""help"" I've received is when I was submitted to the psych hospital for a month after an attempted OD. Nothing changed. During my stay, I didn't speak to anyone, I kept to myself as much as possible. I watched others come and go, interact, make friends, watch movies together, all while I confined in a corner. I guess I find it's easiest not to let anyone in, because nobody can hurt you if you nail the doors and windows shut. nnThat was when I was 16. Now, as a 20 year old, I live alone and associate with no one. Not anyone online, and one or two people at most in person - and I can't really blame anyone for not wanting anything to do with me. It's not like I've evolved, and I'm not really witty. What I am, is sad and pathetic, the very definition of. I wake up, watch tv, eat, quietly play on the computer playing a few games and never type anything to anyone, sleep, and repeat. Day in, and day out, 365 days a year for the last 2 years. nnI don't know what it's like to be ""normal"". All my childhood friends abandoned me when I first started to get picked on in grade 9, suppose because you'd be guilty by association, and after that, I threw in the towel. The extent of my daily social interactions is maybe ordering a coffee or buying groceries if I can muster up the energy to leave the house. nnTo say I have a ""late start"" is an understatement. I just got hired for my first job as a seasonal stocker in a week or two, to be determined, but I've never done any of the regular shit teenagers or young adults get up to. I never shot the shit with friends, never really had many to, never been to a party, never had a relationship.. never done anything a 20 year old should've done by now. I'm out of the loop, so to speak. I'm left to my own vacant mind all day, empty thoughts.. to cope, I've just kinda stopped.. thinking, if that makes any sense. I run on autopilot. I don't commentate in my own mind, I don't really.. have opinions or original thoughts, I've shut down like a broken computer. There's emptiness and numbness, to the point where I can't even remember the last time I was genuinely happy, or sad, or anything aside from straight-faced. My memory's fried, brain might as well be a fried egg, I'm depressing to be around, unattractive, morbid, boring, and extremely, extremely lonely. Everyday, the only thought that crosses my mind is offing myself - I don't know why I haven't already. I find I cling onto this dream that maybe one day I'll have a career and a purpose, a boyfriend, a family even, a nice home I could invite buddies over to.. but all that is, is a dream. Pure fiction. nnAt the same time, I'm not all that educated or can't speak my mind very well because of how long I've been on low power, as you might already be able to tell. I can't describe how I feel inside, I'm hanging on by a thread. All I see are faults, no redeeming qualities. nn&amp;#x200B;nnI guess my question is, has anyone ever experienced anything remotely similar to being so disconnected in a world that's, more now than ever, connected? How can I even begin mending what's broken? There's no real ""support"" systems where I live, give or take CBT groups that I've done a million times in my past to no avail.

I told the student councillor yesterday I'd made no friends in my new class in college and she just said to me ""But you're attractive and I think people would like you, you're such a nice girl, you have so much going for you"" People say things like ""I don't get it, if I looked like you I'd-"" Like, I don't know if I trust them but I can't take a picture without deleting it, I have no social media because I hate pictures of myself, I have to spend at least an hour getting ready to look competent enough to step outside my door, I'm a recovering anorexic and I cause myself acne because I wear too much makeup. I haven't been in a relationship in 3 years because I don't feel 'good enough' despite several oppertunities, despite boys coming up to me when I'm shopping in the city to tell me that they think I'm cute or attractive and ask me what I'm doing or where I'm going.

I developed anorexia when I was 13 and I also had an unhealthy obsession with makeup. Every day before school I'd spend literally 2 hours doing makeup and hair, covering my acne, countering my face, perfecting my eyeliner, and curling or styling my hair. All day in school I'd be topping up my makeup and checking mirrors. I'd hide in the toilet at lunchtime I was so anxious and I'd have to try so hard not to cry some days because if I did, I'd ruin my makeup and everyone would see ""the truth"".

If I could I'd save up and do it. nnI hate that people think because I'm 'attractive' I should automatically be confident, successful and have friends.

There is a girl that I strongly believe has a crush on me but we have never talked to eachother, I sometimes see her at school and she blushes, smiles at me and says Hi, she sometimes pulls her hair to the back, and while smiling looks at the other way, being shy or embarassed. During band rehersal she sits in the same row as me and I sometimes catch her looking at me and it makes me a bit uncomfortable tbh. The problem of hanging out with her are many. Im afraid people will see us together and jump to conclusions to early. Im afraid other people will recognise me and I have to make small talk and that terrifies me. Im afraid of while talking to her I ran out of things to talk about and there will be an akward silence between us, If it is to watch a movie or eating at a restaurant Im afraid of talking to the people who  work there.

5514,"ACommonFellow","post","I've suddenly started having selective social anxiety","Background: 20 year old male, junior in college, diagnosed with SAD,   GAD, Borderline Personality Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder with Major Depressive Episodes, and highly suspected ADHD (currently discussing this with my doctor)nnOver the past year or two, I've noticed that my social anxiety has taken on this bizarre form where I'm 'okay' in certain structured environments and when interactions are purely school related but I am COMPLETELY incapable, like never before, of trying to be just social or friendly, much less trying to make friends or flirt. nnAt this point, it barely feels like 'regular' social anxiety anymore--I am just completely unable to put myself out there as if it's not even an option anymore. nnAlso, despite my anxiety, at heart I'm an extrovert, which makes this that much worse considering I have made zero friends over the past two years (my freshman year at a different campus was disappointing but leagues better than my current situation) and can't even fathom trying to start dating for the first time in my life.nnExample: Sitting in class today, I had no problem discussing the class topic with a girl sitting next to me (i.e. ""talk to your neighbor"" for a minute about X, Y, Z). But as soon as I thought, ""hey I should try and make small talk unrelated to the class"", it's as if I was no longer in control of my own body and I literally couldn't even imagine dong so. nnI've always been the shy, quiet, inhibited, super reserved kid my whole life. I've never been able to make friends normally but could usually 'work' my way into knowing a handful of people and eventually being fairly 'normal' friends. Dating and interactions with women have always gone horrible so I'm damn near incapable of showing interest at this point, but that that's whole another issue. nnBut this, this is new and appalling. It's as if my entire body shuts down as soon as I even think of doing something social. Nothing works either. nnEffexor, Paxil, Wellbutrin, Zoloft in various combos? Worse than when I started. Borderline black out drunk? Doesn't do a thing. A little Xanax? Nope. A lot of Xanax? Nope. Weed? Nope. Phenibut? Nope. Trying meeting new people through my ever-dwindling friend group in a familiar environment? Utter failure. nnIt's like some part of my mind has already given up so it's physically impossible to even try. In retrospective, I'm jealous of my past self for at least having the ability to clumsily stumble through interactions--at least I could take the first step. Failure doesn't even seem that bad anymore now that I can't leave the starting line. nnI don't even know where the fuck to approach this problem from. It's hard enough describing exactly how it feels to my parents or therapist so they can't do shit, nor do they even understand. It's so incredibly bad at this point that I've completely given up on trying for academic pursuits or internships. nnMy foresight has been compressed down to days at this point. I feel as if I'm going legitimately insane which is scaring the shit out of me and, for the first time in years, suicide is no longer just a passing thought (although, if I'm unable to say even hello to someone, I know for damn sure I'd never have the balls to go through with that, nor would I want to).  nnThis combined with all my other fucking issues has created a recipe for disaster that just might derail my life. And I'm stuck here, dumbstruck, trying to figure out what the hell happened in my brain. nnnn",1

She knows I've struggled with acne and probably thinks I just don't keep my face clean. Truth is I've been religiously washing my face with the usual brand names and applying spot treatment creams with little sucesss.nnSo last Friday I got on the dreaded phone and tried to make an appointment with a dermatologist for my acne. It was awkward. I didn't prepare what I'd say or anything, I just called and went with it. Unfortunately my brain just tried to get the whole thing over too quickly and I heard the receptionist chuckling a bit as she had to tell me ask me for more information every time I tried to thank her and say goodbye. Not a big deal. I've accepted that I'm awkward so these things will happen and I've endured much worse.nnThe appointment was today. I did not feel particularly anxious. Or rather, my anxiety couldn't overcome my desire to finally seek professional help for my acne. I stepped into the receptionist's office, told her my name and she chuckled saying, ""we were hoping you showed because you didn't give us a chance to get your contact info"". Well we kept up that awkward tone for the rest of our conversation until the doctor was ready to see me. Something of note: I was able to answer all of her ""adult"" questions properly. Questions about my occupation, address, home number, work number, job title and such. Again I hadn't prepared but my answers rolled off smoothly, I didn't have to lie and I didn't feel like she could judge any of my answers as being too childish.nnDoctor time. We meet, she welcomes me, I give a ""hi"" and sit down. Immediately I wonder if I should have shaken her hand. Well she didn't offer so I guess not. Now it's time to do what I hate the most: talk about myself to other people face-to-face. I didn't hold back though. I let myself mention any slight detail that may have been related despite how silly. I even managed to add in that I'd lost 90 pounds; she congratulated me after confirming that weight loss couldn't cause acne lol. She wrote a few prescriptions, I made a follow-up appointment and left. I did not feel like I made a fool of myself. I know I came off as a little odd but not much more than that.nnAs proof that the experience didn't bother me I got the prescription filled and then ran some more errands i.e. subjected myself to more social interaction. This turned out way longer than I intended so thanks for reading.",0

5525,"ProfessorOAC","post","Tip: Once you begin being social and notice improvement with anxiety, try to maintain some socialization or anxiety might come creeping.","Backstory:nnMy social anxiety was terrible during junior high and high school with puberty and how judgmental kids can be. I was ""popular"" at my small high school but I couldn't even give a class speech in front of my friends. I skipped most parties and social events. Didn't go to award ceremonies even though I was proud of myself. I even skipped out on my salutatorian speech and almost skipped graduation.nnFast forward to college and my family and doctor finally accept that I have anxiety after pleading and receiving a psychiatric evaluation. I was on Hydroxyzine, Buspirone and Paxil (not at the same time) throughout my first two years. I noticed slight improvement from Paxil during my sophomore year and chose to quit taking it during the second semester after understanding how ""normal"" felt to a degree and wanting to improve without meds. My anxiety returned but I still made improvements.nnIt wasn't until the summer before my Junior year that I started noticing a major improvement. I started a new job and was volunteering. I was forced into a lot of social situations with customers and colleagues. My depression worsened and I dreaded every second I was home because I would dwell on what was to come once I returned to work/volunteering. However, eventually it started feeling natural and I became accustom to these situations. I was functioning well and when school began I started having the best semester and met a lot of new friends I would not have met otherwise.nnThen came the hiatus. I had a short break from school and became sick before school began again and after having not been around anyone besides family and close friends for 1-2 weeks I felt like all the progress I had made was lost. I dreaded my classes and interacting in the lab I work in on campus. My interactions felt awkward and the intrusive thoughts returned full force. It took another month of powering through to start feeling my confidence return. nnSo I've learned that I need to force myself to maintain some social aspect constantly to stay within a healthy mindset and to prosper socially.nnHave others experienced similar situations? It feels like if I take a break from society for even a short time I start all over again and my anxiety takes over. I don't want to go back on medication to artificially induce a ""normal"" state because I experienced side effects and I want to feel like a complete person not relying on a crutch to function. (I'm not knocking anyone who does use medication. They work wonders at times.)nnTL;DR Had major social/general anxiety until college. Still had SA/GA but was on meds until sophomore year of college. Learned what ""normal"" felt like. Got off meds end of sophomore year to learn to feel ""normal"" without meds. Improved a lot with constant social interactions from work and volunteering (a lot of group work and one-on-one with strangers). Prospered Junior year until ~2 week social hiatus. Anxiety returned full force. Learned I have to stay social 24/7 or anxiety wins.",1
5528,"AudiblePlasma","post","Social anxiety has ruined my entire life.","It started in middle school when I moved to a new state. I kept to myself. I quickly got the reputation of the quiet weird guy which makes it hard to break out of. Through out high school I only talked to a couple people, never dated or went to any social gatherings. In college I ended up skipping class after these dudes were talking about how something was off about me and I might shoot up the school. I ended up dropping out after one fucking semester and went to a small music school because I thought it would be more comfortable. I commuted there from home and went there for about 3 years. Well after graduating with an Associates that costed just as much as a Bachelor's I realized I made a mistake. The school was for profit which 18 year old me didn't know or care about. I feel like I was scammed just due to my social anxiety making me think it was the only choice for me. Well now I just turned 24 and I'm still living with my parents and working a shitty grocery store job while looking for something in audio to give me more income. The problem is the industry is such as who you know type thing that my social anxiety is even preventing that from happening. nn&amp;#x200B;nnWhen I was 22 I finally met my first girlfriend online since my music school was 99% dudes. This made me even more depressed. I saw all her friends drinking, having fun, hooking up at their college and basically just was forced to watch all the shit I missed out on. I always wanted to have that stereotypical college experience but my social anxiety made that impossible. I've even lashed out at my girlfriend for hooking up with a guy in the past just because of my built up resentment and bitterness about the whole situation. My parents already paid for my music school so if I want to go back I would have to pay for it all myself, and possibly still be stuck at home because of my lack of funds. It fucking sucks. Without my social anxiety I could have had fun hanging out with friends in high school. Could had graduated college debt free with a degree that actually makes money and also experience the stereotypical college experience. But instead I got none of that and now it seems impossible to ever experience any of it because of my financial situation and age. It really sucks because a lot of my girlfriend's friends think I'm physically attractive so I could have dated a lot of women if I didn't have fucking social anxiety.nn&amp;#x200B;nnI've become interested in Computer Science so I do plan to go back for a degree in that but none of my music school courses will transfer so it feels like I wasted the last 5 years pursuing some pipe dream while also isolating myself.nnI'll just have to go to a community college and miss out on the college experience yet again due to finances and social anxiety.nn&amp;#x200B;nnWhat makes all of this worse is everyone pipes that these are supposed to be the best years of your life, which is impossible for someone with SAD because people say that shit due to the potential social experiences. They say how hard it is making friends outside of school but don't realize it is fucking hard making friends IN school if you have social anxiety. I just feel depressed, lonely and I currently only hang out with my girlfriend which I know is unhealthy. nnI am sick of this mental illness fucking up my life. I plan on going to therapy soon but I've already been twice and it didn't help.nn&amp;#x200B;",1

5531,"anxiousperson9301349","post","Does a girl I like actually want me to talk to her? And how can I?","I'm 25, looking for advice.  I have SA, but I've managed to keep it from debilitating my life too much for the last few years. But when it comes to girls things can get very bad; much worse than my general anxiety around people.  After repeated bad experiences trying to find a relationship between when I was 19 and 20, I basically just gave up.  With the last girl I liked (5 years ago), I became completely delusional.  I thought she was in love with me even though I barely knew her, and I would rationalize away all of the obvious evidence to the contrary.  Since then, I don't try to meet girls.  I don't want to deal with all the confusion.  I feel like I don't even know the difference between liking a girl and being obsessed with a girl, and I don't trust myself to judge what people think of me.nnNow I'm in my third year of grad school in a fairly small department, with about 15 students whom I see every day.  I don't have any close friends; but I've been able to get along well with the people in my department, and I've generally been able to get through the day without much difficulty.  I don't do anything outside of the department's building; but I've been fairly comfortable there. The other graduate students in my program are the only people I interact with, and most of them are male.  So its been very easy to avoid girls.  I can't say I've been happy, but the past two years I've been able to live a decent and functional life, doing something I enjoy.  And I was satisfied with that.  nnThis year, there's a new female student, who I found myself attracted to. So of course, my reaction was to never look at her or talk to her.  And things were fine for awhile.  But starting about a month ago, I started to think she might actually like me.  Due to my poor opinion of myself regarding girls, I assumed that I was just misreading things.  But before long it started to seem obvious that she was trying to get me to start a conversation with her.  But she will never actually say anything to me. E.g., she would show up in doorways just as I was leaving a room, or strike up conversations with people near me.  nnThe reason I've avoided girls the last few years is not just fear of rejection.  I'm not even so worried about saying the wrong thing (I'm making a worse impression by blatantly ignoring her!)   Really the problem is that if I like a girl, and I think she likes me, I become obsessive and ruminate about everything.  Well, that's already started happening with this girl, and I've been loosing several hours every day to it.  So I guess there's no point avoiding her anymore.  But every time I think she wants me to talk to her, and I don't, I feel like a failure, and my anxiety has been getting worse and worse around her because of it, and it makes me feel completely incapable of talking to her.nnI think what's holding me back most is the doubt.  It seems obvious; sometimes I even think she talks to half of the students in our program about me.   But what if its all in my head?  I think what I'm afraid of most is that I'm going down the same path as what happened with the last girl I liked, and in reality I'm actually just deluding myself.  nnHere's an example of how I could be deluding myself.  I think she's even trying to accommodate my social issues.  For example, I have one class with her.  For awhile, she would come into my shared office before class and start talking to people (not me); or she would go into the classroom early, and start talking to people.  But I avoid group conversations.  The last few classes, its been strangely quiet Yesterday, I walked past her while she was talking to someone else, and said ""hey guys""(""Hey"" is the most I've ever managed to say to her).  Then in class, the guy who normally sits between us sat on the other side of the room, leaving just an empty seat between us.  After class, I thought I heard someone say mutter ""so we're supposed to be quiet now"".  nnSo whats going on here?  Here's one possible explanation.  She figured out that I don't like talking in groups, and stopped talking to other people when she is around me to give me the chance to talk to her.  When I said hi to her earlier in the day, she took that as a signal that I wanted to talk to her, and told the guy who sits between us to sit somewhere else, to make it easier for me; and she asked everyone else to stay quiet before and after class.nnIf that explanation is correct, and she's going through all that trouble instead of just addressing me herself, then I'd feel pretty bad about not saying something to her.  But doesn't that explanation sound absurd?!  Did I just create a ridiculous conspiracy theory?  This is really a more general problem: the more it *seems* obvious that she wants me to talk to her,or the harder she *seems* to try, the more I worry that I am just radically misperceiving things.  nnShould I just ask someone?  I'm not very close with anyone, but there is one person I talk to frequently.  But I don't know how.  I could just ask ""is she trying to talk to me?""; but it would make me feel like I'm asking ""am I completely delusional?""nnI wish she would just say something *to* me (of course, I guess she thinks the same thing).  I think that if she did, and removed the doubt, then I'd be able to talk to her reasonably well. But when I don't talk to her, she makes up some excuse.  At least I think its an excuse, but it also re-enforces my fear that its all in my head.  For example, the other day she went up to the desk next to me and moved around a bit (I was too afraid to even look at what she was doing), and then left.  It seems so obvious that I'm supposed to say something there; but later she comes by to talk to the guy I sit next to, and says she was looking for something on his desk.nnI don't know if she likes me, or if she's just trying to reach out.  Either way, it really is a shame, because by being so indirect about it, its just making my anxiety (and my life) worse.  Whenever I'm in a situation where I think she wants me to say something to her, I feel so pressured to do so, but also afraid, and my anxiety gets so bad that I just feel completely incapable of saying anything to her.  I know that the obvious answer is to just go ahead and do it.  My psychologist keeps telling me this; as well as other things I already know (my fears are irrational, nothing bad is going to happen, I'm making a huge deal out of nothing at all, etc).  But when I say that I don't feel capable of doing it, all my psychologist has to say is that I *can*.  But he can't tell me *how*.  When she triggers my anxiety, I feel like I have no control.  It feels tortuous to even glance in her direction, let alone say anything to her.  nnSo my main question is this:  I know I should talk to her, but whenever I get the chance, the pressure and anxiety are so strong that I feel incapable of doing so.  So how do you talk to someone when it feels impossible?nnOther question:  Should I ask someone I know about whether I am reading things correctly? If so, what can I ask that can leave me with some dignity if the answer is ""no""?",1

There have been times where I have absolutely despised myself, sometimes contemplating with suicidal thoughts. But one thing has helped me more than anything else(SSRIs, Therapy, etc.), and i would like to share it.nnnnI stopped looking at myself... Like, literally... i sometimes forget what I look like.nnThis all started when I realized that one of the most intense symptom of mine is facial flushing. When I am with other people, my face flushes to a beet-red shade, often accompanied with a period of excessive sweating. Now i know, these are only two symptoms from countless of other social anxiety symptoms, but that doesn't mean that this method can't work for others. nnThe Idea of this absurd, yet pretty effective method is to view yourself as basically a spiritual ""Shape"", rather than a human. I like to compare it to losing a sense. If you can't see, all your other senses strengthen, to compensate for what is missing. If you can't judge yourself by your looks, your other aspects strengthen.nnSo what I am trying to say, instead of physically trying to impress other people or look a certain way, just go into situations and try to focus on properly articulating your opinions and philosophies, try to focus on making yourself interesting, rather than attractive. Don't focus on how your hair is laying on your head or feelings that may arise in your body. Your body is just your little brother who you're bringing to the date and don't want to give attention to. nnI think this method has potential to be effective for many, because it reinforces self control. In my opinion, many trends in the ""battle anxiety without the use of drugs"" movement work as good as they do, because they cause you to build up distractions. Things like the keto diet/really any other strict diet(focusing on diet, focusing on not eating as many processed carbs), exercise(focusing on going to the gym everyday, focusing on the right exercise and right form), meditation(focusing on doing it everyday, focusing on other parts of life where it may be applicable). All these things require us to shift our focus to properly do the things that we set out to do. nI think it's similar with this method, as one will figure out that it is actually incredibly difficult to not look at oneself. nnThis method hasn't really reduced my ""physical symptoms"" thus far, but it sure as hell has made me stay in situations I would have ditched half a year ago + allowed me to hang out with friends without giving a fuck or needing a drink to have fun. So, yeah, try it out, i would love to hear yalls feedback. ",1

I’m gonna explain what’s happening as of recently: I’m going to tell something good to my love of 11 months (at the end of this month). I’ll kinda indirectly tell him I like him as more than a friend.nnSo about that guy, he’s 16 years old like me (but 4 months younger), I’ve known him since we started school. We’re not super duper close but we’re excellent friends and I want to take it further. He shows some signs but I don’t know what to think: he’s nicer to me than to other people, smiles at me often, he listens and helps me when I need something or have a problem, asks me for supplies in class, told someone I’m super beautiful and super nice, laughs at my jokes and compliments my creations. When he cheers me up, he seems rather happy about that. Today, I heard he was about to be in a relationship with a girl who is a year older than us. He didn’t pursue that decision thankfully. Although it happened back in September or very early October. He might’ve left that decision for my sake, I dunno. Also, I went out with him and a good male friend of mine who’s also his friend back on September 15. He was really fun to be around and seemed very happy there. I want to ask him when I feel 100% mentally, physically and emotionally ready. Do you think he likes me?nnI talked to one of my best friends (I have 2) about that and she said that I should do it when the time feels right. Also, I don’t care if others see me negatively. In my country (Lebanon), people generally don’t like when the girl tells the guy. Also, there isn’t this “dates before relationship” thing here. You immediately go into the relationship.nnSome former temporary friends (they were mean to me in many ways, not just what I will mention) told me not to do it, shit like I’m too weak to do it, he should come at me, what matters is your friendship (I don’t give a fuck, I love him way too much) and that traditional local mind “The girl shouldn’t make the first move”. I don’t care about that anymore. I’ve deserted them. I’m an atheist and so is he, we don’t care about pleasing society (our families aren’t but I suppose it’s ok but won’t go into details). I’m definitely telling him good stuff.nnWhy do I like him? Well, in general, people are not nice to me other than my 2 best and only friends and are two faced or mock me (they think I don’t know but trust me, I do), but he purely is nice to me. I can feel he likes me, at least as a great friend maybe even love/crush. I feel like we compensate each other’s traits, he’s very smart, logical, cute, sweet and funny. Those are my ideal traits.nnWell, now onward to what I’ll say. As mentioned, I talked to one of my two besties and she said to say some good and sweet stuff but no “I like you”. I’m thinking about saying “You are really really nice to me and you make me feel really comfortable. You’re also really funny and sweet.”. I’ll make sure to find him alone in a good mood. Is that a good saying? If not, what can I say?nnNB: This is my second love, not first. So don’t tell me it’s my first one.

Its just that im not sure that i have Social anxiety and my opinion changes like weekly. What if im just a stupid little naive teenager who thinks he has a mental illness? Its just that my sister suffers from pretty bad social anxiety and today she found out that im going to the doctor and she said that she presumes that i dont have anxiety. For example she said that i dont feel fear when i leave the house. But does it really have to be so bad that you feel extreme fear everytime you leave the house? This is the post i made a couple of months ago explaining my situation:nnI dont know if this is the right place to ask about this, but i would like to ask some questions regarding  i could be suffering from social anxiety. nnFirst off i should probably say that im 15 years old, and that during the last year and a half ive just felt like my abilty to speak in class and general nervousness has gotten worse. I cant even manage to raise my hand in class (not all the time) and i get shit nervous when i have to present something in front of my class.   nIf its just a normal presentation, i will already start to feel some anxiousness the night before and sometimes have sleeping problems. During the presentation i normally get really sweaty, blushing of the cheeks, increased heartrate and generally i just feel really fucking nervous. Once or twice my knees even began shaking. This is a bit of an pessimistic look at it, considering that ive often also held presentation where i was nervous, but without blushing, and afterwards i just felt like it was a succesfull presentation where people couldnt see how nervous i was. nnThe most nervous ive ever felt was probably when i had to perform a group presentation which we had worked on for a week, in front of about 40 other kids. I already began thinking about the presentation several days beforehand, and the night before my presentation i slept on the sofa because it made me feel more safe, but i barely slept. I almost threw up right bedore the presentation, and afterwards my armpits were drenched,and smelt really awful(more so than normally when i sweat) nnI often overthink my relationship with my friends(oh shit hes gaming with ... and hasnt invited me, doesnt he like me??)nnA couple of months ago i had to go to a big family dinner with people i dont often see, and i was so nervous that i just stress ate a whole plate of chocalate and really felt like shit, i just felt really really nervous even 24 hours beforehand which is unusual for me. nnThe reason that im writing all this is that today was my first schoolday after several weeks, and we met our new teacher. She was generally very nice, but she did something i absolutely despise. She wanted to hear everyone speak, so she picked one kid to speak first and the that kid had to pick another kid to speak until everybody had said something. It made me feel really nervous because i had to speak before my class without having prepared anything. Secondly that day a new kid joined our class, so everyone had to say something about themselves. The only thing i had to say was “my name is ... im 15 years old and in my sparetime i like ... and ...” Which went fine, but again it filled me with anxiousness.nnSince then nothing much has changed except that its gotten a bit worse. The new teachers lessons have been hell, for almost every lesson we have to present something in front of the class. For example we watched a movie, and then the next day we were handed badges with different words, and then she would be like “okay so bread, what would you say about the main character and blablbla” I felt extremely nervous and felt like i was going to throw up. All i wanted to do was to jump out of the window and flee to mexico, but i survived even though i was asked something and my cheecks turned bright red and i feltnLike i was burning up. Furthermore, i attend these lessons 3 times a week and during these days i dont sleep as well as normal, and feel nervous all the time, even the night before. nnOne of the reasons why i felt like i maybe dont suffer from SAD is that i dont often feel the same symptomps when interacting withnPeople as opposed to presenting something, and i dont know how to differentiate between shyness and anxiety in these situations. For example i accidently stumbled into some of the girls from my class, and some other people from a different class, and walked with them to the school and i just felt totally out of place. I didnt know wether to leave or stay, and i ended saying some cringy stuff in panick, and i was sweating during the whole ordeal. Im also pretty sure they were talking about me afterwards which didnt help. Its just that i dont often meet new people due to that ive gone to the same school in the same class for the last 9 years and dont have a social life outside my class, so i dont really have alot of experience regarding that which makes it harder to decide wether i have anxiety or not. nnExtra question: Is getting cold hands when having to present something a sign of anxiety?nnI guess that im just a bit confused right, and keep changing my opinion every 30 minutes right now. This post has been extremely long so if anyone actually read all of this i thank you very much :D",0

5544,"lizardsoldier","post","I thought I'd overcome my social anxiety but I just had an anxious moment. Just need to vent.","I was diagnosed with SAD about 7 years ago. I had a few specific thing I was anxious about, the list of which might look familiar to some of you:nn* Dating-related thingsn* The gymn* Being around people who break even the tiniest least enforced rulesn* Afraid of unfamiliar social situations, mostly anxious about what I should be wearingnnAnyway, I had gone to see a counsellor and I'd worked through it with some good CBT. Not to brag, but recently I've been exercising at the gym (even using the showers - a big surprise to myself!), asking many girls on dates, I'd gone to a few things overdressed and simply didn't care, and I'd become OK with parking my car in a 60 minute parking stall for 65 minutes. These are all progress for me.nnStill, there were limits to what I was comfortable with so perhaps I wasn't as over my SAD as I thought I was:nn* I only invited girls on dates online where I know they are into men* At the gym, I only exercise in the squash courts (practicing hitting the ball and running around the court) and on the running track (usually just 1 other person), and it's hard to do it wrongn* Even though marijuana laws weren't really being enforced in Canada pre-legalization, I could never be OK around it until it was recently officially legalizedn* I was OK with being overdressed to things but not underdressednnAnyway, I recently moved into a condo and part of my condo fees go to some fitness equipment we have. This equipment is kind of visible as you drive by and the light of the fitness room was never on so I assumed that no one used it. Finally, a place where I could safely use a weight machine for the first time without worrying about other people also being there!nnSo I got my stuff together and went over. I was trying to swipe in and my swipe card wasn't working. That's when I see a reflection in the glass of a girl behind me. I immediately froze. She was waiting to enter the fitness room too. What are the odds?! It had NEVER been in use before.nnI said hi and she gave a polite smile and said nothing in return. Obviously she is uncomfortable that I'm there, right? Well, not actually but that's what I was projecting from myself onto her. Better to leave.nnI made some excuse that my card wasn't working (the truth, but a bad excuse when I could've just asked her to let me in) and then darted back to my condo and wrote this. nnI thought I'd be OK with a situation like that but I suppose not. Oh well...nnThanks for listening. Time to get back on that bike and keep riding!",1

5558,"dots445","post","Having a bad smile","Sorry if this turns in a bit of a vent, I can't really be upfront about it elsewhere. I have a bit of ""horse teeth"" look and some diastema as well. Teeth are also not perfectly white due to bulimia. nnIm broke af and can't just ""get braces"". nOver the years, substance abuse, depression, shame, eating disorsers and a few aspects of avoidant and borderline personality disorders are worsening, and since everything is so connected and being alienated from the world doesn't really help. I crave and run away from people in general. nnI still want to improve myself and contribute to the world. I manage to still have some closer friends (except when I don't), but generally I am rarely comfortable around anyone. Strangers and acquaintancies are scary. Never been in a real romantic relationship. nnThe last guy I was kind of having a connection, even though we met thrugh tinder because I was craving validation (last year was rough, stopped using it for good) asked me then second day we were hanging out in person if I had ever had braces (I did, but it wasn't entirely corrected), I got quite concerned, angry and ashamed since he pressed on a really sensitive spot of mine, he continued that he likes everything about me, only this could be fixed. He could even help me pay. I got pissed at this kind of offer and was done with him at this very moment and became even more sensitive to this. He then became terribly clingy and when I denied him he started showing a not-so-cool and clingy version of him.nnBut this was months ago, I tried to kind of continue with life. Still, everytime I smile I remember this. Or even before, so I try to keep my mouth shut.nnBut these constant reminders, even if I want to forget and focus in other things. nnToday I was at my psychiatrist since I am kind of spiraling in other areas. Out of nowhere she asks me about braces/teeth as well. Can I just have a fucking break and some safe space. Accepted by one person in this world, perhaps? We never even spoken about it. I know I'm really sensitive and a friend told me to just not think about it... But it is important to me, it's paralizing. I can't even forget if people keep reminding me of another ugly thing about me, there are enough other things which are ugly anyways. nnNoone likes a person who doesn't smile. Some people are not so bothered by it, but whenever I read about some advice for socializing there's (of course) smiling involved.nnHow/why can I smile if the person, romantic interest, boss, stranger, whoever, will dislike it. I get so jealous to people with cute teeth, they don't have to be perfectly white or aligned, just... not this way. These people can still have ""imperfections"" and look stunning since they can offer the world their genuine, nice smile.nI wish I could do that.nI wished for it when I was having braces, paid a lot for them, hurt a bit too, wasn't smiling as much, but... That was from years 16-18. I'm 22 now. Last time I could smile without feeling bad about it was when I was a child, and the thought of it is quite hard to handle.nnI will however see another ortodontologist. Maybe I can get my teeth figured out untill around 26 this way. Just... How to live untill then? It would not help having a normal smile while every other area will be even worse since I'm stuck (not just because of teeth of course). I don't even want to be around anymore and have so much to do. nI don't know where to start. ",1

The only other family that visits is my dad who comes for 1 hour every month. No other family. No friends at all. All because of how significant my anxiety is. I can't handle going outside.nnnI've searched for help for so long. I've sought help from others online, from self help videos and books to personally researching mental illnesses and finding strategies to combat it, but nothing has helped. It continues to grow worse and worse.nnnI've never been to a doctor, so I've never been diagnosed, but I suspect I probably have other kinds of mental illnesses as well as my anxiety, and I'm also having pretty bad health issues that are growing worse and worse. nnnI'm significantly underweight as a male at only 117lbs and 6 ft tall. I have some kind of skin inflammation issue that has been getting worse and spreading all over my body that started in my late teens. Sleeping issues. Joint pain issues. Memory issues. Issues focusing. Issues learning and enjoying things. Anger issues. Incapability of maintaining online friendships. Social issues. The list goes on and on. I'm just really sick. Both mentally and physically.nnnReally, what I want to do is see a therapist. An online one.

This might be a bit long. I am turning 16 soon, and am in 10th grade. I have always had what I think is pretty bad SA.nn It causes me to not talk to people I don't know and I have a hard time talking to adults or asking for help in school. That didn't really effect me though because I had always did good in school with all As and Bs up until the 2nd semester in freshman year. I used to have a good friend group (I don't even know how I did that) who supported me and my anxiety wasn't too bad. I moved in 8th grade to another state. I didn't know anyone and ended up being bullied by this one girl and her friends. It was only a matter of time before it seemed the whole school was against me. I couldn't go a day without hearing my name in the halls or class and while I didn't know anyone, everyone seemed to know me. I made it through 8th grade with alright grades but with lots of Cs. I still got into an advanced program in high school so it was okay. nn The first semester of freshman year went good too. I don't remember much of it, but I got all As and Bs again and everything was pretty easy, despite having no friends. Then at some point in the second semester things went down hill. I was very lonely and my SA started to get worse. The only friends I had were online which was alright but I was still lonely. I'd often cry alone in my room because I longed so bad for friends again. My anxiety causes me to be in physical pain almost constantly. My chest will get very tight and ache. It will get hard to breath and my throat will hurt extremely bad, often times making me cry more. I started to be more anxious in school. I couldn't focus too well and my grades started to drop. I stopped doing work pretty much because I had no motivation and I would get extremely anxious just trying to start. I'd sit and stare at my paper for an hour before I would stop and do something else to try to calm down and stop hurting. I would just feel hopeless trying to even start. I started dreading school and being so panicked and anxious, I ended up skipping or saying I didn't feel well (which to be fair, I didn't feel great), and not going to school. My parents were very upset after finding out my grades and we had a conference with my councilor, parents, and all my teachers.nn I was so anxious and didn't want to go. During the conference they told my parents about how in pretty much all my classes I was missing a lot of work and how I had poor test grades in math and some other classes. I couldn't even pay attention to the conference. I was holding back tears and the pain was so unbearable. I couldn't look up at anyone, I just stared at the table. I had a hard time speaking and after it all my dad was extremely pissed off. For the next month life was just even worse. I would constantly get yelled at by my dad, I would get singled out. He would use any excuse to yell at me and it just made it all so much worse. I got very sad and my anxiety was through the roof. Finally summer hit and it was my saving grace. But I ended up with mostly Fs and a couple Ds on the second semester. Even despite this, my dad didn't bother me much during summer. He made me get a job though. I was very anxious and worried but after I got a job at a place my older sister worked it was okay. 1000 times better than school. I still didn't really talk to my coworkers, but it was a comfortable environment.nn Once sophomore year started I was hopeful everything would be better this year. It wasn't. My anxiety has gotten way worse. I can't pay attention in class. I still dread school but I don't skip. I try to pay attention to my teachers but I just can't. I don't talk at all. Other students have asked me why I don't talk, asked if I was mute, etc. Its not like I don't want to talk, I do so desperately want to have friends. I just am so scared to. Whenever we have to do group things I either do it on my own or end up not doing it. I can't raise my hand in class because its just paralyzing. I am failing all my classes again. I can't ask for help because of my anxiety. The thing about school just stresses me out. I have had panic attacks in school a lot more now. When I want to talk to someone or a teacher my throat hurts so bad and I literally can't bring myself to speak. I can't even look at someone. I have started completely avoiding things because of my SA. I also have never went to a doctor or psychiatrist for my SA. I have tried bringing it up to my parents but they seem to either not care, or think im exaggerating. Now I feel like I can't talk to them or anyone for that matter. My dad has called me rude and other bad things because I have been too anxious to speak. They see my failures in school as me being lazy and spiteful. nnI feel like I can't even get help for my SA. My own parents seem to not believe me. My dad also doesn't think highly of therapy and pills for this stuff anyway.nn But back to the title of this post. School has only been making my anxiety worse. The constant stress is overwhelming. At this rate I will not even graduate high school on time. And I don't see any of this improving. I know im young, and I know dropping out isn't something to be taken lightly. But I really want to drop out when im 16. I would start trying to get a GED immediately.  I don't mind working too. I would still be productive and try to work on my SA.  I just feel like anything would be more productive than to sit in school lost and in constant pain and stress. It isn't helping me in any way.nn Im so sorry if I did this post wrong. I just need advice. I don't know what to do. After a long time and trying to build the courage to, im going to talk to my counselor about everything said in this post. I was really nervous to even make this post, and I greatly appreciate anyone who actually read it all.   nnn  n ",0

It is, as you would expect, very embarrassing.nnI rarely do presentations. It is my first semester of college, and I just had my first one yesterday and then I have another on Monday. Next semester I have at least one, and that's probably it. Do you think beta blockers would work/make sense for me to take for presentations only? I've seen posts on here about people using them for daily interactions, but I wouldn't use them for this. Just for presentations, so like 5 pills max a year. nnI really wanted to get rid of this problem on my own. I even went the lengths to join the debate club at school, forcing myself to give speeches at tournaments, for multiple rounds a day. It made me incredibly anxious but I did find that the more I did it, the better I got and the less shaky my voice was. Regular school presentations got better during this time. Even so, the symptom would randomly pop up in certain situations. The demeanor of my opponents, maybe, or the lighting or setup of the room or just my mood would affect it. I did a few presentations throughout high school, each with its own struggles. Sometimes my voice didn't shake, but sometimes it did. Yesterday it did, in front of my college class. I probably earned myself a nice D on that assignment.nnI feel like no matter how hard I try, this keeps coming back. I am going to see a therapist soon, mainly for depression but for SA too. Hopefully I will be able to work on this. But it has been this way for 5 years now and I don't know how much longer I can take this. I feel like continuing to give presentations with this symptom is reinforcing my fears instead of making me feel better.Every time I have to present, all I can think is ""my voice is going to shake, my voice is going to shake."" Even if I do everything I can to minimize the presentation in my head and reduce my nerves, the anxiety takes over once I start speaking. I feel like maybe taking a beta blocker before presentations would calm my breathing enough to make my voice stop shaking. Hopefully, maybe after using it for a few speeches I would get more comfortable presenting and not even need it, since I would stop associating presentations with a trembling shaking voice. nnWhat do you guys think?

I don't believe I'm depressed because this is a reasonable response to my situation.nnLeading up to, during, and sometimes after any social interaction, I can't focus on anything but the anxiety I feel and although I realize my thoughts relating to social interaction are irrational, I still fear it more than anything else. For every interaction I fear a million different negative possibilities, and every time at least a couple of them become reality.nnI've never had a job because I wouldn't be able to bring myself to the interview, let alone going to work every day facing other employees or customers. My only few friends were made before this social anxiety disorder was a big problem, since then I've separated myself from potential friends once the friendship got too involved and stressful. I've never had any conversation more than a minute with any girl my age; a girlfriend or even a female friend has always been out of the question. I stopped going to classes at uni and eventually dropped out due to the immense fear every time I had to leave my room. Lately it has started to sink in that to make a living I HAVE to interact with others but I'm at the point where I avoid all social interaction unless it's 100% necessary. If I could somehow make a living without any interaction whatsoever I would have no problems in life! I've been suggested a few 'solo' jobs but they're all far fetched or require at least a bit of interaction every day/week. I’ve tried extensively to make money online but that has only been a waste of money so far and now I have no more to invest.nnSeeing a doctor/therapist/whatever is out of the question because nothing will convince me to do it with the fear I have, especially since I can just research whatever bullshit techniques they're going to feed me. People say social anxiety can be overcome with a lot of work, well CBT therapy sounds like torture, so does getting a job in sales to give myself exposure therapy. If I have to go through all of this torture to fix it I would just rather kill myself gladly. The only reason I haven't is because it would devastate my parents. I think I'm going to do it anyway though; that's a risk of having kids so it's not my problem. Everyone else that cares should realize it’s my decision and it's a reasonable one because I'd be ending my unavoidable every day struggle.",0

5621,"mybrainismean","post","HYPER self consciousness","Hello friends!nnI have BPD, GAD, social anxiety, OCD and depression (a PERFECT tinder bio if anyone is looking for one) and recently I have found myself going into somewhat of a downward spiral where I literally cannot say ANYTHING without thinking twice about it. It's hard to explain, but I have approximately 2-3 close friends, and I have become so hyper aware of everything I say around them/what I text them/the memes I send them that I have found myself cutting down how much I interact with them because I am terrified that everything I say or write to them is annoying/embarrassing/TMI/boring/cringe-y/narcissistic/vain/silly/dumb/stupid. Everything I say goes through a filter that goes something like ''Why did I just say that? If someone else said that to me I'd judge them and think that that was a stupid thing to say so now literally everyone in this room is probably sitting there thinking ''God, she's so fucking annoying and cringe-y''. I literally can't even text my friend ''Hey how are you doing lately I haven't heard from you in a while'' without LITERALLY having a nervous breakdown, crying and losing control over myself because I feel that I am bothering her (I'm a female with only female friends) or she thinks I'm annoying or she's avoiding me on purpose. I HONESTLY feel as if I am losing my mind. I am TERRIFIED (as you probably can tell) about losing my friends, and the logical part of my brain is telling me that this is silly and erratic and overly dramatic and they're most likely NOT thinking these things but everything in me is screaming that I am a worthless loser that they all just somehow tolerate. I have tried it all, I've tried affirmations, I'm on meds, I've tried meditation, I've tried positive thinking, I've tried therapy, I've read every self help''YOU ARE A BADASS YOU'RE AMAZING LOVE YOURSELF'' book under the sun,  I try to talk sense into myself but it all just comes back to my low self-worth and my extreme hatred of myself. The crazy thing is I come from a stable household with parents that adore me and I adore them and I've never gone hungry or cold or without love or affection. WHAT I AM ASKING IS, does anyone else feel this way? Is anyone this hyper self-critical and self conscious and self aware to the point where they can barely function?

My family and I moved from Norway to Sweden for two years before returning. So I started third grade here and wasn't shy at all. Like, I danced multiple times in front of class and the school by myself with no problems. I can't remember where everything went wrong. nnSo I'm in 12th grade now, with more or less no social life, struggling to to go school, struggling to even talk to my siblings (who are twice my age) and a thriving eating disorder, which I want to say that I have control over, but I don't. Social anxiety and an ed, definitely go hand in hand and just makes everything a hundred times harder. nnAs I'm writing this, I'm sitting in one of the school bathrooms and bawling my eyes out, because of foreign languages class (which I'm ditching again for the fourth time in three weeks). I've been learning German for like five years now, and Korean for two (self-taught). BUT my classmates act like they are perfect in everything and have this totally fake personality when speaking to others. Also the teacher is pretty strict and doesn't teach well. Everything about German class gives me anxiety. Like, I understand it, but do not dare to speak. I guess this is where my social anxiety kicks in. I have talked to the school and they said that they would not put me under an oral pressure (except from presentations). But you can't learn a language properly without speaking it tho. My anxiety is so bad I'm like cold sweating, rapid heart beat, dizziness and headaches (the ed makes it even worse). I can sit in class and hold back my tears, but it's hard considering we have double classes. So two hours of every class. I don't raise my hand in other classes either.nnI'm going to change school after summer vacation. I currently go to what is considered the ""best"" and ""most prestigious"" school in my city and considering how hard it is to get in, I shouldn't complain. Maybe changing to a more ""normal"" school could help relive som of my stress... I go to a psychiatrist, but I don't feel like it's doing anything good.

5688,"ctelesford","post","What is wrong with me","I'll try to keep this short. I'm 25 and I currently live in Brooklyn. I've been here my whole life with the exception of college. Speaking of college, I have a bachelors degree in English (I know) I am currently unemployed and my last two jobs were in non profit academic advisory roles. I was pretty much a loner and hated school throughout life. I was taken to a therapist when i was 12, and they declared I was ""normal."" I started questioning life in college and realized it was pretty useless and that it was school and work until you die. I drank liquor i would say the normal amount for a college student.nnAfter graduating, I took the two advisory jobs which I hated both jobs due to anxiety. I am not a people person in general and I would sweat profusely when talking to students or even in mildy hot temperatures. I sweat 10x more than others even in the winter. I would sweat in a crowded subway or platform or talking to new people. I spoke to a doctor and I was prescribed robinul and told I had hyperhydrosis. The robinul works so that part of my life is solved temporarily. In addition to this, no matter what allergy medicine I take or what dose, I drip water from my nose and eyes. If I go outside especially in the morning, and its sunny or windy, my eyes water. I get acid reflux and heartburn from tomato sauce, coffee and liquor (all things I love).nnI also find myself getting extremely angry at the simplest things (people walking slow in the city, etc, to the point where I think about attacking someone in my head.) When I began feeling suicidal at my first job after graduation, I spoke to a therapist again who once again told me I was ""normal"" a ""regular new yorker"". At this point I am at a wits end and speak to another doctor who prescribes me zoloft and other downers. I mix them with alcohol in a excessive amounts to cope with the job I hate. I stop taking the zoloft pretty because they didn't work for me. I was taking to a hospital where people told me i was a handsome man who had things to live for and sat next to a girl with 16 cut marks on her arm and a guy who wanted to start fires with his hands. I did my research before hand and I realized that they would probably give me shock therapy (I don't know how that would help) so I pretended to feel better.nnFast forward to today, I am unemployed living off my parent. I work out about three or four times a week, I am about 5'11 195. The only problem is I have little to no appetite daily and I am starting to develop a belly. I eat maybe twice a day (where i force myself to eat),I sweat like Patrick Ewing in the fourth quarter if I don't take robinul and i work out 4 times a week So this is unexplainable to mennAnyway, I've had ultrasounds, endoscopy, colonscopy and the gastro doctor stated I was in perfect health and the only theory he has is ibs. As you can see, I've had a long series of issues in my body and doctors telling me everything is fine and blah blah etc. So I'm at a wit's end. I also have gynecomastia in both nipples and it's another obstacle that is annoying to deal with. I'm unemployed so I have no insurance to see any more doctors and i just think life is bullshit and I don't want to deal with it.nnI have a girlfriend, who helps me want to keep living, although she keeps alluding to marriage in kids which I'm vehemently against. The only people that stop me from slicing my wrist's are her, my mother, aunt, brother and 3 or 4 friends. I spend my days applying for jobs, jerking off and playing 2k in between the gym and my gf.",1
5694,"h0203throwaway","post","I don't meet social anxiety criteria anymore, but now have different social issues. Is it still social anxiety?","I've had GAD/OCD and social anxiety ever since I can remember, though I was only diagnosed at 21. I've had therapy, I'm 24 now and my social anxiety got so much better, I actually don't meet the criteria anymore. I've had the textbook symptoms for years, but they're mostly gone. However, now I struggle with different social issues and don't understand why.nnMy struggle with social interactions comes from simply not knowing what I'm supposed to do or say. I care very little about other people's judgement, and generally ""stand out"" because of the way I look but I genuinely don't even bother thinking about what others might think of me - the problem is that how to have conversations, especially casual ones, keep up with friends, is a mistery to me. I always watch others interact with a sense of wonder because it looks like such an effortless performance, with a script that I kinda know but can never fully grasp to perform myself. I don't understand where they get their conversation topics from, I only talk to people who share my main interest because I can actually talk about that. nnI only know one person irl outside of my family, and when I have to do small talk, with people who don't share my interests or that I have to be somewhat formal with, in real life or through text, I'm physically uncomfortable, as in I feel a cringe-like sensation from the inside that's almost painful, because following that script and knowing what to say is so hard. It feels like I'm being forced to say an incredibly cringy joke. Greetings can be especially hard, I never understand if I'm supposed to use formal speech or what greeting is more appropriate. The sensation persists for a couple days after the interaction, so I avoid talking to people as much as I can. I'm not anxious about sounding stupid or other people's judgement, I'm stressed out because I know no matter how well I perform, I'll still feel this sensation. More complex interactions are a nightmare because I often feel like I'm missing on something I'm supposed to understand, but for some reason I don't get it like others do.nnI make very little eye contact but not out of shyness, I'm not a shy person, but because it simply feels wrong and overwhelming, actually almost painful in the same way I described just now.nnI really, genuinely don't mind talking to others, the problem is that communication itself, as in knowing what to say, coming up with an answer, is hard, especially because most people's conversations seem to be completely self referential. They're not talking about a real topic, they just talk about generic stuff and it has no real content to discuss. I feel like I can never understand how they come up with the right things to say, they're working on a different level that I have no access to. I ghosted so many people I liked, not because I was anxious, but because I couldn't come up with a way to start conversations and keep them up even if I tried very, very hard.nnMy psych agrees that this doesn't match a social anxiety diagnosis, but she didn't mention any other possible diagnosis. Personally I can't relate to people with social anxiety or anxiety in general for the most part, I always felt like there was something else going on even when I met all the criteria. We had issues in common but they seemed to process them in a different way.nnAre these issues remnants of having social anxiety for so long or should I try to get tested for something else? Thank you.",1

5710,"KosmG","post","I made some progress, maybe it can help you.","I will start with just a bit of background. Since the start of highschool I have dealt with a strong social phobia that still haunts me now in my college days. Basically, my core fear is social interactions that occur in groups of people; I will get severe panic attacks and muscle stiffness; not being able get words out or even laugh at others jokes becasue of the tension I feel; completly disociated from the emotions and dynamics of the group. It was so severe, at the beginning the only solution i found was for the group of people to be quite and not socialize, so none of my fears would pop up.nn This core branched into all sorts of other problems: depression for isolating myself at home, extreme anxiety at public places,  low self esteem, paranoia directed towards relatives, lack of social tools for everyday interactions (interacting with a cashier, for example), toxic relations becasue it affected me so much to be seen alone, a strong fear developed for constantly being judged as antisocial.nn&amp;#x200B;nnSo, how did I improve in this vortex of misery?nn1. The first big step was to allow for my fear to cool off. My social interactions were catastrophic because inside my head i was feeling such intense emotions of fear and anxiety while other people where relaxed and normal, so our perspectives and behavior were completely incompatible, thus getting constantly rejected which would just enforce my fears even harder.   I took time off before entering college and made a routine with less ""dangerous"" social enviroments. Just going to the gym, taking an online course (yes, still caused anxiety),  therapy secessions, few friday dinners with family. At the beginning I still got a lot of anxiety and fear, but to this routine I was able to adapt and set aside my original fears because it was not nearly as socially menacing as school.n2. Its improtant to recognize how fear makes you fetishize social relations, but even more importantly, that you need to normalize social relations by confronting these fetishes, simply being conscious of them is not enough. So for example if a friend was telling a story, instead of actually paying attention to the story, my mind would wonder on social aspects like:  is it an interesting story? should i laugh, are other people laughing?, would i be able to tell such story to other people?, is he telling it with good social skills? how much attention is he drawing?.  Its kind of an egocentric part of social anxiety where our insecurity constantly makes us put a lot of thought process and comparisons to a social interaction, and prevents us from giving an honest and instintive response. I believe we do this out of fear of having to confront people and having the interaction as frictionless as possible, which results in forcing smiles, laughter, or interest for the other people. But this is of course not sustainable in the long run (especially if the social fear reduces as you get to know people) because your mind grows very tired of faking responses and they become more obvious for others. The solution is to find a middle point where you actually get to confront people: if they say something that is not interesting then you hold a stance and show no interest, but not in a abrupt manner because then the other person might actually react negatively. This in turn makes the other people adapt to your own tastes and thus the interaction becomes a lot more healthier as now both parties are making a social effort.nn&amp;#x200B;nn&amp;#x200B;nn&amp;#x200B;nn&amp;#x200B;",1

I've worked multiple jobs in the past but it's the same every time- just constantly being uncomfortable, sweating through all my clothes, stuttering, and my hands and legs shake so much it makes a lot of jobs very difficult.nnI've gone to multiple doctors and been prescribed so many medications I couldn't possibly list or remember them all.

I've gone to 3 separate therapists and they only seem to force me into a deep depression.

I honestly don't have any close family, my father won't talk to me because I'm gay, my brother doesn't understand my health problems and thinks I'm a freak and my mother wants nothing to do with me. I'm not exaggerating any of these facts. This is the truth and I really need to crowd source some answers because I feel so trapped. I have no idea what to do about this crippling social anxiety, I'm afraid I'll never be in a relationship or work or live a normal life. I feel like I was just born broken and I'm just trying to make this shit work.nnAm I just supposed to keep chucking opioids and benzos in my body and live life geeked out of my mind?

I style my hair, clothes, and makeup to be feminine and normal looking. I’ve denied my sexuality for so long because it wasn’t “normal” to be that way. (Bad thinking, I know. I am working on it) nnI rarely talk because I’m afraid of accidentally and unintentionally insulting someone.  I love making people laugh, but rarely make jokes for the same reason.  I’m also too nervous to pursue real relationships because I can’t feel comfortable to open up. Or if I do open up, I end up avoiding people like the plague because I’m ashamed and embarrassed of myself. Someone literally needs to drag my *** around for a long time before I can actually believe they like me enough to have them in their life, which is way over the top for someone else to do. nnI overwork myself trying to do the job of 4 people because I’m afraid to look like I can’t handle the workload, and also I’m afraid my coworkers will hate me if I ask them to help me or do something for me, so I struggle. nnI’m the “drinker” at social events, but that’s only because I believe i’m funnier and more tolerable when I am tipsy, so I tend to always be down to hang out if I know I can drink so I can socialize properly. nnIt’s all intrusive thoughts.

My dad drank himself to death, taking with him money for years worth of medical bills, leaving our finances in shambles. What happened around me in my early years was mostly: sickness, death and financial instability.nn**School:**nnIn school I would develop a deep inferiority complex due to not being able to afford or share the same hobbies most kids my age could. Also, being bad at sports and shy and having bad posture made me unpopular with girls. I felt vulnerable because neither of my parents made me feel safe. I was a somewhat bright student. The first 14-15 years of my life followed the same schedule   n""school""-&gt;""home""-&gt;""sleep"". In school I watched as my crush started dating another guy, while i stood on the sidelines not having the guts to approach her. I finished school with just 1 friend. My childhood was gone.nn**High School:**nnI joined High school with high hopes of turning my life around. New friends and :fingerscrossed: a girlfriend.. maybe?....... . What happened? Within 3-4months my hope dried up. My life looked a lot like my life at school. Here too I had a crush I did not have the courage to pursue. I started to realise all my expectations weren't gonna materialize, I was never gonna have the lives my classmates did.  I started drinking, smoking, anything i could do to get high. Stole 2 bottles of Choloroform from my Chemistry lab and had a bad trip with that as well. Tried to ""Off"" myself thrice and was later diagnosed with major depression and anxiety. I dropped out 1 year into highschool.  nnn**Shut In:** nnThe next 3 years I spent in my room with my pc. ""Getting Up""-&gt;""gaming/porn""-&gt;""sleep"". Gave up trying to ""Off"" myself because I could not find anything painless and reliable. My social anxiety worsened.I deleted all my social media accounts since they just reminded me how much of a failure I was, compared to all my classmates who were enjoying life. 3 years passed as I stagnated. My teenage years were gone.nn**Fresh Start:**nnWe moved. I decided to use this to get back up, since money was starting to go dry. I set out to mend my life. I joined a community college with very less students. Made a few friends. Still could not talk to women. But overall got good grades and graduated. Continued the momentum in University. Initially had a LOT of panic attacks even for something as simple as taking a bus, but eventually i had a routine. I pushed through, using smoking as a crutch. Graduated through uni with a high CGPA. Learnt coding, prepared a tonne and landed a tech job before I had even graduated. So what if I was three years older than my classmates?, so what if I had no girfriend &amp; was a virgin?, so what if I was a loner? I HAD A JOB !! My efforts of over an year had borne fruit. Finally something started to look good in my life. SA at this point was manageable. Also quit smoking during these years.  nnn**First Job:**nnIt was a remote corporate job. I was attached to batch of new joinees all of whom already had work experience. They formed social circles within a few days. Of course I was not in it. It started to get very uncomfortable for me, since I was never In any of their conversations &amp; SA was starting to act up and I was having panic attacks. I felt stressed and isolated. I quit in 5 days. nn**Second Job:**nnIt was remote. A tech stack I liked.  Kept mostly to myself. Training was cool. And work was enjoyable. It however was a company with bad leadership whose future did not look bright. nnOne day I got a mail saying I was shortlisted for an interview with a ""Company A"", they did a lot of bleeding edge stuff in 5G. I gave the tech interviews and cleared them. Got the offer. The annual compensation of the offer was more than the annual compensation of both the first and second job put together. The only catch? It was not remote. It would be difficult, but I decided to take the plunge. Maybe after this people would not look at me as a failure.  Maybe I would even be earning more than some old classmates. Get a girlfriend ... I got starry eyed.nn**Current Job:** nnIts now my second week on this job. We are a group of 20 new joinees. Some have corporate experience and some dont. However they are ALL extroverted. They have formed social circles ... which of course I'm not a part of. During a team building activity, where we were asked to write a phrase describing a colleague, someone ass\* wrote ""Ultimate Insecure"" next to my name ... it hurt . I can manage technically but cannot seem to fit in socially, I have started feeling stressed and SA is popping its ugly head again. I feel like quitting. I am back to being the quiet kid in the corner. Nobody makes an effort to strike a conversation with me. There is also a female colleague who is quiet shy, but she's pretty and everybody makes sure to strike up conversations with her and include her, so she has no issues. Life feels unfair. I sometimes cry myself to sleep these days. The cycle never seems to end. Is there really no way out?  nWhat should I do?  This is my third job in 6 months I cant keep switching like this. I need advice. This maybe my chance to finally get my life on track. I dont even care about romance at this point. Just some normalcy .. please",1

I would like to know how severe my social anxiety is and if anyone is in a similar situation.nnNot sure how to start, but anyway these are just things directly related to my phobia. There's more to the picture but I want to make this direct.nnI've had social phobia ever since I was a kid. Also had selective mutism from ages 7 to 12. I was extremely sheltered and my mother was the closest person to me. nnDuring early teens, I would avoid standing up and walking in public because it was agonizing to do so. Just being in school and knowing there were other kids around me stressed me out every second. Felt like I was being judged for every little movement. Even contemplated taking my life at 16 because the sheer terror I experienced every single day was getting too much. Literally sheer terror. No, I don't hyperventilate or have a panic attack(not the generic type anyway); I just breathe really, really shallow and tense up. Didn't have many friends until I turned 17.nnI'm 19. I am extremely socially awkward. It takes up almost all my energy just to approach someone and initiate small talk. I can't hold conversations, it just feels like my brain drains out after 5 seconds of talking. Although I feel much more assured and confident compared to my past self, it still feels like it's never enough because every other person my age is so damn talkative. Not as rowdy and violent, but still talkative. As I was extremely sheltered, I can't find much to talk about with anyone. I now know that being like everyone else isn't life or death, but everytime I want to talk to someone or open up more, my mind just goes blank and it's like there's a stone wall holding me back. Like an alarm going off in my head and everything shuts down automatically. I can't control it. nn&amp;#x200B;nnI've tried breathing methods to help my anxiety. Tried therapy when I was a kid. Meds have helped but they made me feel so out of element and slow that I stopped. Prozac, btw. I've never been able to talk to a therapist about it because of my phobia itself. I hated them anyway. nnIt feels so incredibly painful to put myself out there into the world. INCREDIBLY PAINFUL. Not exaggerating. At this point in life, I feel as though I have no hope at all. There are so many things I want to do. I want to write, make art, make music, maybe even sing, for fuck's sake.  I have these dreams of doing great stuff, but they're always postponed; wait till I overcome this, wait till I get over that, etc. I really don't think I'm worthless.

Why do I keep doing this over and over again?","These past two days, I had an orientation for my new job as a mental health specialist. nnYesterday I got nervous when I saw the people in my orientation group. They were already getting along with each other. I didn’t look or act like them. Behind me, some of them were talking in an outgoing way. I felt scared. I started doubting whether I should be doing this job. Then, the orientation leader asked if any of us never worked with patients before. I raised my hand. I turned around to see if anyone else did. Then I made a face when no one else raised their hand. I felt like I had made a mistake to raise my hand and make a face because now I looked insecure and inexperienced. I wondered if I was putting out a bad vibe and everyone hated how insecure I looked and I had officially ruined it here. nnThe next day we went around and shared what work experiences we had. I said I’d done liver cancer research and psychology research at some prestigious schools. Everyone else talked about working in hospitals. It seemed like I didn’t blend in. Then when the teacher came by my seat to get my test, I told her I’d left all the orientation packets at home but I’d get them during the break. She asked how I’d get home and I said I live nearby. I felt weird having everyone hear that. nnThen we got into groups to do a mini test. We would share our answers with the class. I started getting really nervous and intense and desperately needed to get the answers right so I wouldn’t be wrong in front of the class. I freaked out at the thought of talking to the class. I kept asking intensely about this one question and I could tell others could hear me getting intense. We got this guy in our group to do the talking but he didn’t really read the answers and the teacher kept asking why the rest of the group wasn’t helping. Meanwhile I sat there with my head bowed down and said almost nothing. I felt so nervous. nnThen the teacher told me to read a paragraph and said I should read it loudly. She didn’t say this to anyone else which made me wonder if I was being really quiet. At the end the teacher practically whispered to me, asking if I had my test. nnI felt like everyone thought I was weird or hated me by the end. What is wrong with me.

I have always known I was “different” and that I struggled with anxiety but managed well enough during childhood and adolescence without professional help. It was only after completing an internship over the summer and completely crumbling under the pressure that I decided I couldn’t keep going on like this.nnMy psych diagnosed me with GAD and noted I had social anxiety issues but didn’t officially diagnose me with SAD because  a number of things she quizzed me on I don’t struggle with  (eg i have no problems interacting with strangers in public, making phone calls, eating in public etc). nnI’ve been doing a lot of reflecting and definitely relate to a lot of the issues mentioned in this group - being awkward, bad at small talk, overanalysing conversations, ruminating on everything stupid I said afterwards etc. I’ve always thought I was socially anxious. nnBut something I have really been struggling with at uni and my new job isn’t a fear of saying something stupid in front of strangers or embarrassing myself and being scrutinised as the DSM-5 puts it - it’s more this constant, overwhelming feeling that everyone that gets to know me even a little bit dislikes me and wishes I wasn’t there. When I talk to uni acquaintances/colleagues it’s like there is this voice whispering in my ear “why are you still talking to them? They don’t like you. See, they’re looking over your head to find someone better to talk to. Take the hint and excuse yourself” etc. When I get anxious about going down to my work drinks it’s not because I’m scared I’ll say something stupid or unfunny - it’s knowing my colleagues will be down there and desperately not wanting to impose myself on them to the point of avoiding the event entirely. It’s almost like a defence mechanism - I’m not some oblivious idiot who has no idea everyone hates them, I recognise it and am respecting it by not going up and forcing myself on people. nnCan anyone else here relate to this sort of mentality? Is this something that develops after a lifetime of struggling with SAD and developing self-perpetuating defence mechanisms, or is it something different/worse? I am fully aware the way I think is unhealthy and probably causing a lot of my social issues but I just can’t help myself, and it is causing me a lot of depression.

5847,"keheelee","post","I’m close to giving up","This will likely be a bit long and rant-y so apologies in advance. Any advice is welcome. nnSo I’m 19F and I was diagnosed with social anxiety and depression when I was 14 but have suffered since early childhood. I finished high school last year and I’m now doing my first year of university. I had a bad habit of skipping classes in high school due to my anxiety and I told myself I wouldn’t continue that habit in uni, but low and behold, here I am, so many absences I’ve lost count. nnThe only time I leave my house is to go to uni or to go to my dad’s house. I’m close with my siblings (I have 6), so I have a lot of social interaction with them, but not really with anyone else. I still keep contact with my friends from high school via text/social media, but I haven’t seen anyone in a while. My plan was to make friends at uni but I don’t go regularly enough to build them up from acquaintances to friends. I know the simple answer to my problems is to push through and keep going to uni and build friendships, but I’m at a point where I JUST CANT. I know that sounds like a cop out, but so be it if it is. I’m just exhausted. nI’ve never had a job, and my mum is pushing me to get one (she has bpd so discussions about this topic become explosive very quickly and she has 0 understand or empathy on this issue). I really really want to, honestly - but I know what I am like. I can’t even attend uni classes regularly, how am I to expect an employer to put up with me? As much as I may tell myself I will attend every shift, I know myself, I know that I avoid things when they get hard. nnUltimately, I know I need to get back into therapy. I saw a therapist from age 14 - 16 but I stopped because something my therapist said hurt my feelings (stupid, I know). I went to a few others, but I didnt find anyone I was comfortable with so I stopped looking. I honestly don’t know if therapy even works for me. During the two years I saw my therapist, my social anxiety made me feel the need to not let her down. I would lie to her and pretend that I was getting better because I didn’t want her to be disappointed in me. Logically, I know that’s not how therapists think, but I just can’t stop myself from being like this. nnI honestly don’t know if I want to get better. I just want to give up. I feel like I have reached a point in my life where this is the furthest I was meant to go. I look into the future and I see nothing for me. I want to get married and I want to have kids but that brings forth a whole new wave of problems (having to meet my husbands family, having to stand in front of a crowd on my wedding day, having to socialise with other mums at school, having to socialise with parents when my children have play dates etc.). I just don’t feel like the reward is worth all the suffering. Many will look at me and call me weak, and that’s okay, because maybe I am. I’m happy to be called anything, I don’t care anymore, I just want this pain to end.",1

I guess I just wanted to get some things off my chest.  nnSorry if this will be long but anyways, here it goes.  nnI’m a 20 y/o Swedish chick who has struggled with being a social outcast for as long as I can remember. I’m extremely introverted and people often get annoyed with me as I can come off as either arrogant (which I’m not, on the contrary I’m really insecure and withdrawn) or just gloomy and difficult. I don’t have a very good sense of humour and feel lost when others laugh and make jokes. Even around close friends I feel lonely and isolated as if I don’t really fit in anywhere.  nnI have always loved music (mostly heavy stuff) and a little over a year ago I finally decided to get myself a band to jam with. I ended up joining a black metal band as singer and it’s been a lot of fun with parties and gigs. With time we’ve gotten really tight as a group and I’d definetely say those people are my closest friends, but I still can’t shake that feeling of being an outcast. It’s frustrating, because I always feel so out of place. It’s not just my feeling, either, as they (mostly the guitarist who can be a bit of a cunt, especially when he’s drunk) often point out how strange and quiet I am all the time. I sometimes worry that they will let me go just because I’m so introverted, but they all seem pretty happy with my songwriting and stage performance so I’m probably not going anywhere, at least for now. But even if I manage to keep those people around and keep the band going (the music is basically the only thing I live for. I have no other friends, no job, no education or anything) I still feel depressed out of my mind. It doesn’t help that I have severe OCD either (not the kind where I have to check the oven a 1000 times, but the kind where I get nasty instrusive thoughts). Some days I can’t even get out of bed because everything feels so hopeless. My anxieties are killing me, everything feels so bleak and I’m so afraid of ending up completely alone. I can’t enjoy anything anymore and I’m losing control. I’ve become completely obsessed with death and thoughts of suicide. I spend a lot of time just roaming the internet on the hunt for pictures and clips of dead bodies for no good reason at all. I’ve even put myself in potentially dangerous situations just for the lulz.  nnI’ve tried for so long (I even went to a shrink when I was 15) to combat my social anxiety and depression, and I really don’t know what to do anymore.",1

5895,"fildarae","post","Difficulty standing up for myself","I truly believe that a lot of my social anxiety began because of a cousin who I used to follow around like a lost puppy when I was young. This cousin is a narcissist and a complete bully and would find any excuse to tear me down because of her own problems in life (e.g. one time she got some bad news, started crying, and my eight year old self put an arm around her to try to comfort her and she screamed at me to “get the fuck away from her” and shoved me away, hard enough to bruise. I still can’t be around people when they cry now because I have no idea what to do and I get panicky and completely freeze up). Any minor mistake was always met with the likes of “are you fucking stupid?” snarled in my face like I was a complete failure. Because she’s quite a few years older, I was always too scared to stand up to her. Other family members have even expressed surprise that I spent so much time around her as a kid because of how badly she would treat me, but if I refused to hang out with her or stay at her place on a certain night she’d be even worse. I couldn’t win. nnWe’re both adults in our twenties now, leading separate lives so we don’t see each other too often (and honestly I avoid her like the plague and let her think that’s just how circumstances have worked out), and a lot of things have happened this week that are bad enough to lead me to completely cut ties with her. But my social anxiety keeps convincing me I’m in the wrong. I’m definitely not, and several other relatives are completely cutting ties with her too, but I can’t stress enough how much of a bully she is. When you anger her she says the nastiest, spiteful, lowest shit she can possibly think of, as publicly as possible, just to hurt you. The last person to call her out was mocked all over her social media for their past suicide attempts, she’s THAT mean.nnShe hasn’t realised I’m cutting ties yet, but I’ve barely slept in days because I feel sick over what she might do when she realises I am - especially because I can’t trust myself to stand up for myself, because it’s so easy for somebody to make me feel guilty just for standing my ground and not letting them treat me however they want. Luckily any confrontation is unlikely to be in person - otherwise I’d stutter and shake all the way through it and she’d laugh in my face for it - but I completely expect to wake up one day with a post on my Facebook wall or something just listing all of my flaws and tearing me down. nnAt this point I can’t decide what would be best - to force myself to finally stand up to her and hold my ground, or just to give her absolutely no reaction when she starts waging war (blocking, ignoring any attempts at contact etc.) - either way I’ll be mocked and berated, but I’m just so tired of being too scared to stand up to her. It doesn’t even occur to her that I’m capable of disagreeing with her at this point because of it.nnI’m sorry if this post is all over the place, I’m just so tired of feeling like a punching bag, but I know logically fighting back (and I have a lot more dirt on her than she has on me) would only lower myself to her level and probably give me a panic attack when I do. But I feel like completely ignoring/blocking/going no-contact will reinforce her idea of “ha! She’s scared of me!”. I’m also scared that if she does draw me into an argument, she’ll convince me that I have no right to be upset with her and turn the tables on me. nnI start counselling in a couple of weeks to deal with my anxiety and depression (there’s a lot of other stuff in my past) but I’m expecting things to kick off before my first appointment so I can’t ask my counsellor for advice just yet.",0

I try to visit my grandparents often. I just don't know what to talk about. I miss a connection with them all. With my mother's side it is better, but her family is small. My father's side sense of comedy is making someone else the butt of the joke but in a way that it isn't funny at all to me. Or it's just confusing for me, I just think it's mean behaviour only realising way later they were joking.nnThey also think very narrowly minded. My cousin is in therapy and she always tells me that all people that work in psychology aren't right in the head. That they are crazy (I guess she knows because surely she isn't there to work out some problems herself right?)nThese generalisations are made so often. There is no freedom for new experience. It feels limiting.nOr this one: a few months ago my cousin wanted to play cards with my brother and uncles. Then my father and uncle said that she wasn't allowed to play along because it wasn't for girls. My cousin got mad/upset and my father and uncle (she's her father) just laughed. My cousin started crying and ran away. After awhile they said they were just kidding and she was allowed to play cards with them. She forgave them just like that.  I don't get this sense of humor or behaviour to each other. I feel alienated.nnMy little brother is way more social with them, hanging out together often. I hate that I can't fit in the same and I'm afraid I'll end up going the same path as my older cousins who decided to leave the family. One broke contact, the other went far away. This is confusing for me too. I don't understand what happened and it's clearly something we are not supposed to talk about too much. There's a emotional block in place where everyone believes everything will be fine in the end without having to take action.nnI feel awkward around my family. I hate it. Everywhere I go, I feel confident and ready to talk and love to make people laugh. Sure the moments of stress are there but it doesn't define my behaviour as much.nBut when I'm around my family I become this very socially anxious, insecure, passive version of myself. I shut my mouth and when I get made fun of I just smirk it off.nnI can take spending the holidays with them for now, I live with my parents so I'll spend Christmas where they want for now.nnIt feels so awkward. I feel alienated. There is nothing to talk about. It's like we live in totally different worlds. At school I take pride in being different, but with family I feel ashamed of myself.nnBut waking up with them for a whole weekend kills me inside every time. I feel damaged and it takes awhile for me to become myself again.nnI was really happy when a school trip was planned in the same period as the vacation. I felt relief. I shouldn't feel relief, I should be happy to spend time with them. I know showing up means a lot to my dad and grandparents.nThe school trip got cancelled and friends asked me if I wanted to hang out the same weekend as the vacation.

I feel worse for having this appointment and don't think others should have to deal with the same. So here is what happen.nnnThe issue I went in for was social anxiety. Which he seemed to just count it as general anxiety and not believe it was a separate but similar issue. He then decided it was because of college after I told him I've been like this since 12. I also brought about my concerns for having ADHD which he dismissed as not something that adults have and something everyone grew out of. I tried to explain this wasn't the case even referencing the HSE website which states ~2% of adults have ADHD this seemed to have annoyed him. I then explained side note I'd been diagnosed as dyslexic just to further my claim in relation to ADHD (due to statistical correlation) he then said I didn't have ""real"" dyslexia. nnnAt the end of it all I was given a proscription for mirtazapine and told not to bother with any form of therapy until I had ""stabilized"".

There needs to be retraining in these areas as the complete lack of knowledge is dangerous for patients.nnnThe first time I went there I was told by another doctor no need for any medication and so he put me on a waiting list for CBT (2 year waiting list turns out) and told me social anxiety is something most people grow out of. I'm just turning 26 I can't just hope I grow out of something that is damaging my life for 14 years. The clear lack of understanding of what I feel is a serious issue is hurtful.

I just turned 20 and am in my first year of community college (I took a gap year) and there’s few opportunities for interaction at my school. nI’ve had a boyfriend for the past 9 months, and every time I would be in a group situation with his friends or family I would be extremely socially anxious and unable to know what to say, when to speak, and often times what the point of the interaction was at all. nnI understand how it could be fun for people who know how to interact and for people who are already good friends with each other to do things in groups and go to parties together, but due to being rejected so much socially I have developed this “What? I don’t even get the point of those types of ‘shallow’ interactions” type of mindset. Like “oh so I’m not cool enough to do that, so that thing isn’t even cool to me anymore anyway so whatever” lol type of mindset. nnI genuinely do not know how to navigate group interactions or even one on one platonic interactions and despite actively working on it still harbor so much envy toward those who do. nnMy boyfriend and my therapist have both described me as being very personable when they each first met me as I was raised to be very polite. I also went on this group backpacking trip program last summer and I remember certain people being very shocked after being around me for a week or so to hear that I hadn’t spoken with pretty much anyone other than my parents for like 6+ years. But I still developed zero bond with any of these people in my age range with whom I had a lot in common and was in the middle of the wilderness doing challenging things with every day for a month. Sleeping near them, eating with them, doing memorable things like climbing mountains with them, but I made no real connections bc I was too afraid to talk in group interactions. nnI know I am very naïve and rely on self deprecating humor and just giggle too much in general out of nervousness, and so people begin to treat me like I’m stupid or immature and I don’t like that feeling. I think that’s a bit narcissistic bc I just want to be seen in a positive light… I want to be normal if not “cool” haha. nnAbout a month and a half into dating each other my bf was like “oh by the way I tell everyone you’re my gf” and that was exactly what I wanted to hear, but despite that I still hated saying that I had a bf and would say the word “boyfriend” with gritted teeth for like a month after that. Bc I had had so much resentment toward girls who were pretty and liked by boys and all around “good enough” to have boyfriends bc I felt I wasn’t for so long and then developed an “ew romantic relationships are gross nobody likes me and I’ve developed this weird pride and attachment to that identity” thing as I still have about platonic relationships.nnDue to always fucking up in social situations and often times apparently doing a horrible job despite thinking I was following all the rules and doing okay, I have become very confused about the whole thing and extremely self conscious. I don’t know who I should be and what I’m allowed to do basically, and am probably narcissistically hyper-vigilant and concerned with what others think of me. nnEvery day, and sometimes subconsciously, I’m observing others and trying to learn how to act and who to be to avoid rejection. I am constantly trying to figure people out so to speak and feel ridiculously, illogically different from others. nnThanks for reading. Any similar experiences or tips greatly appreciated 🙏🏻",1

I was really stressing for this but when I was there, it wasn't bad. I didn't stumble that much on my words (Usually its pretty bad) and I didn't look nervous. I really tried to stay calm. I feel like when I'm calm, people relax more and they feel more comfortable around me. The lady was surprisingly nice and wasn't uncomfortable to speak in english with my mom since she can't speak the main language. I'm brown. Where I'm from, people tend to be a bit racist. Like, they'll look at you differently, or they stare (a lot). They speak to you like you're stupid. With social anxiety, I can tell you that it's been an absolute nightmare since i moved. After every social interaction, I would hate myself lol. But this was actually nice :) I didn't feel like an idiot and even though i did stutter a little bit, I think that this was a win for me. Lately, I've learning some things to improve myself and to get rid of social anxiety (it's gonna be hard but I really want to find a way out).  I can't go to a therapist because my parents won't really let me but that won't stop me bxtches. Here are some of the things that genuinely helped me:nn* Law of attraction: I saw the Secret (it's on Netflix), and in this one clip, this guy was getting severely bullied for being gay. He change his expectations that ""people will definitely hate me"" to ""everyone respects me"". And his life changed. It sounds unrealistic but I definitely think that LoA can help. It helped me getting things, attracting better social experiences and it works. Research it and practice it. There are many videos on yt from youtubers that show many different ways to practice it. (Leoor Alexandra, thelovegal.com, Stargirl TPW, The Gem Goddess helped me a lot).n* Self-development youtubers: I know you see mostly beauty gurus who just say things like ""Be confident and be you"" and that's not enough. Some of them give amazing advice and they explain it CLEARLY. They helped me with a lot of things like dealing with toxic people, getting rid of toxic traits that I have (We all got some) and really loving myself.  When I show myself love, I feel less resistance and less hate. I feel more comfortable to be in public. You don't need to have a reason to show yourself love. Also, they take time and they genuinely want to help. They cover a lot of important topics that don't get talked about and they explain HOW you can solve your problems. (Charisma on command, Infinite waters/Diving Deep, Teal Swan and [Actualized.Org](https://Actualized.Org))n* Meditating: This takes practice and it's hard to concentrate but let me tell you how much I was able to calm my nerves and reflect on myself. It made me notice emotions that I was carrying everyday which, in fact was making me more anxious and scared.n* Having a positive mindset: I know you're probably reading this and you're like ""STFU!!"" but oh my goddd guys it does help. It's so much better than being negative and I heard that whatever you think about, you attract it in your life. I know with social anxiety, thinking negatively isn't something you can control but you can learn!! It'll feel unnatural and like your telling yourself lies at first but the more you do it, you get more used to it. nnAnyway, I hope this helps you :). Sometimes I still feel like giving up but what's the point of living life, if you can't enjoy it. also, sorry if I made mistakes or if this was hard to read. keep going x",0

It was amazing. For the first time in my life I was able to control my anxiety, interact with customers, etc. I started off on 2mg and told my doctor ""This really isn't helping me that much. I think I'd have to take 4mg a day for it to last all day"" She bumped it up to 3mg and after a few days of being on it I felt great.nnIn the psych ward, the doctor wanted to put me on 0.5mg of Klonopin and did so for four days. I convinced him to give me at least 2mg of Klonopin because I told him the list of drugs I've been on and how I've been having panic attacks for 9 years (constant twitching, fidgeting, shaking, sweating, almost all day) and I finally found something that helped me after trying 15 different meds and 7 therapists, meditation, eating right, and frequent exercise,nnMy parents forced me to voluntarily sign in to a psych ward because they were going to kick me out if I didn't go. They told the emergency room workers I said I was going to kill myself and left me there when I said ""no, I said I had suicidal idealations but I never said I was going to hurt myself"". I shook a bottle of pills in front of them when I was pissed off at them and said ""how many pills should I take today to feel happy"". They called the police on me. My dad got in my face and started yelling at me a bit later when we met up in the hallway and I said ""maybe I'll be gone forever then"". He called the police again. My mother told the police about me wanting to break a bucket I wanted to either buy a car and insure it this week and let them hold onto the keys, or use my brother's car to take my driver's ed exam, so I could get my license that week. (My doctor took me too fast off my Effexor and I was agitated during the days this was occurring which contributed partly to my behavior most likely) . Instead I spent 9 days in a psych ward until they decided they'd pick me up (I was only supposed to stay 2-4 days but they told the doctors all of these stories about me and then at the last minute said they couldn't pick me up on Friday and you can't get discharged on the weekends)nnNow I'm back home. I went to see my psych doctor. I've told her I've smoked pot before and taken mushrooms a couple of times. She won't give me back my anxiety medication because she said ""it's addictive"". I told her I have no criminal history and have never been hooked on drugs, and that people take up to 20mg a day of it. I asked her why she'd change a dose that was working for me. I couldn't get a response from her.nnI don't know what to do because I don't have the time and money to visit a bunch of psychiatrists, to find one that is willing to give me back my 3mg dose of Klonopin. I don't know if there is some way I can explain the situation to one and say ""look, this is what happened. This is the drug that helped me. I've tried 15 different drugs for 9 years. I used to use pot in college but have only used it twice in the past few years, and I drink maybe 3 times a year. I'm not a drug addict. I don't have a criminal background. When I was on 3mg the constant state of anxiety stopped and people started treating me differently when I didn't have constant nervous twitches or a scared look on my face. I was actually starting to feel happy for the first time in a long time.nnHow do I find a psychiatrist that is willing to give me the dose back that's worked for me? Do I disclose my previous medical history to them? I can't afford to uber back and forth and window shop, I'm trying to buy a car or get a job with close-by apartments and move out. Is the only way to talk with a psychiatrist by paying them for an appointment and meeting up with them first?nnMy gut instinct is telling me that she's either keeping me on the 2mg because she doesn't want to take responsibility/lose her license if something happens to me while I'm on 3mg, or the fact that pot showed up in my drug test at the hospital because I had smoked for the first time in a year and a half so she considers me a 'drug abuser' now and thinks the Klonopin is just another way for me to get high.",1

5953,"ActuallyEffect101","post","Social Anxiety","I usually wouldn't make a post like this but I've expired most of my options and i feel like i need to tell my story so that i can get help.nn&amp;#x200B;nnI have had social anxiety for a while now and have been fighting it for a long time. It first started in my early teenager years and is persisting now at the age of 17. At first i felt defeated, like i couldn't do anything due to my social skills being trash and as a result fell into quite a bad state. After months of me isolating myself from people and becoming less and less socially involved i finally decided enough was enough and that i was going to face this fear head on and stop avoiding situations so much. nn&amp;#x200B;nnI realised the main problem was my self esteem and childhood trauma. I had been bullied to an excessive degree in the later years of primary school and realised that people who i thought were my friends were actually just using me or manipulating me into doing things for them when they didn't really give a damn about me. During the earlier years of primary school i was extremely confident. I didn't fear anybody as i truly believed in myself and thought of myself as equal to everyone else. So ultimately the bullying that followed resulted in me becoming a very shy person. It didn't help that i took a lot of things personally instead of just brushing it off which further fuelled the bullying. nn&amp;#x200B;nnThe bullying led to home issues. I started taking out my anger on my parents and started refusing to go to school. I also struggled to sleep at night as i was often fearful of the next school day and would keep my parents up all night. This led to an extremely toxic family life. My parents are great in all honesty as i don't know how they even put up with me and i hate myself for this but i was so angry and sad and i didn't know how to deal with the anger i felt. Normally i was an extremely peaceful person but the bullying overwhelmed me and i became an extremely impatient person. Taking this anger out on my parents resulted in massive fights usually over nothing where i would go completely insane and it would sometimes become very physical. I was so bad i started to break things around the house and i hate myself for it and i just appreciate the fact my parents understood the situation i was in and stuck with me through the whole thing regardless of how much of an ass i was being. Eventually we looked for professional help and i was able to stop the outbursts of anger. My patience returned to me and the bullying stopped. Everything seemed good. nn&amp;#x200B;nnOnce i moved to comprehensive school i got bullied a bit more but it did not manifest itself as anger this time. I would never do that to my parents again so instead i became more and more anxious. Due to the bullying my self esteem quickly dropped and i started thinking of myself in negative ways. I started fearing people (especially teachers) and became extremely careful of who i trust. I started developing bad anxiety symptoms such as violent head tremors and shaking, increased heart rate and a sense of being unable to breath. The worst for me though were the tremors and they seemed to occur when i made eye contact for prolonged periods of time or when i was way too far out of my comfort zone. I ended up in a viscous cycle of worrying about my head tremors which would only make them happen more often when engaging with people. This crippled me socially and is something that still affects me now.nn&amp;#x200B;nnThat leads me to today. I still get head tremors and i am still incredibly anxious. I have tried to improve my self esteem by going to the gym and doing productive activities however i still think incredibly negatively about myself. No matter how hard i try the subconscious part of my brain constantly judges me and over analyses everything i do and i can't stop it. I have been fighting it for a long time and i'm at the point where i feel like i'm going insane. I have made improvements but its still there eating away and its tipping me over the edge. Every day i worry about mundane tasks that i shouldn't have to worry about. My friends say they admire my ability to never give up in almost all situations and that it inspires them to fight their own battles yet i feel like i'm starting to lose grip of the victory that feels so close. For over a year now i have been attending parties with my friends and have been trying to put myself in more social situations so i can overcome it yet it always comes back. I might feel confident in myself for attending a party and doing socially well, yet three days later i'm back to worrying constantly and feeling like i'm worthless. nn&amp;#x200B;nnThe head tremors is what makes me worry so much. I worry people will notice and despite improvements i have made this is still a problem for me. I struggle to make eye contact with people i don't know well and often struggle to strike up a conversation. Its like i have this barrier around me that is activated when someone i don't know well appears that makes me incredibly self conscious of my body to the point where i can feel every nerve in my body tensing up when i really just want to relax. The weird thing is when i accidentally embarrass myself i actually get a confidence boost. I like that i was able to make people laugh and i think the fact that nothing bad happens actually boosts my self esteem in the moment. Its weird how it works and as a result i don't know how to stop it. I want to interact with people normally yet i'm always so tense, quiet and downright fearful that i can't and as a result have to fear every damn situation i'm put in. I just don't know what to do. I went for professional help but they turned me away saying that its not severe enough after only two appointments. Fear is powerful and i'm really struggling not to be the coward here yet no matter what i try i'm still stuck in this situation. nn&amp;#x200B;nnUltimately i feel like ive improved a lot and am in the home stretch of finally killing off my social anxiety yet i don't know what to do to get there. I'm still overly critical of myself and i still struggle in some situations. Does anybody have any advice on how not to care or how to just be myself? nn&amp;#x200B;nnThank you if you took the time to read all of this.",1

Sitting here now, as a college sophomore, I feel incredibly distant from my 8th grade self. Unfortunately, as much as I feel like I’ve grown in other ways, I still have not outgrown my weaknesses.nI’m depressed but I have no reason to be. I’m lonely but it’s because social situations send me into panic mode. I’m bored and unfulfilled but it’s because I struggle to get a job. My parents are disappointed in me but it’s because I’m a disappointment. nI spend most of my days on the couch zoning out in front of the tv. My parents want me to work but I seem to keep failing to live up to that incredibly reasonable expectation. At the beginning of the summer, I managed to get a job at Goodwill but quit within a week because I had a panic attack and absolutely humiliated myself. On the night I quit, I came home in tears and told my parents what happened and they were so upset with me for not pushing past my anxiety. At first I was offended but then I realized they were right. I’m weak and it’s obvious to everyone around me that I’m weak. I’ve been to a few job interviews since quitting but have been repeatedly turned away because I’ll be leaving for school in mid August and it would be impractical to hire me.nI want to go back to school so I can avoid the people I know I disappoint but I’m terrified because last year was so awful. I was so lonely and miserable. I barely ate and didn’t take care of myself. I was constantly sick and never interacted with anyone. It was the first time I realized how toxic of a person I am.nIf allowed, I will waste all of my time wallowing I’m self pity and being a burden upon others. Because I’m still on my parents insurance, the therapy sessions I attend and medication  I’m prescribed, comes out of their paycheck. I’ve been like this for six years now and I still have not managed to fix myself. nI don’t know why I can’t fix myself. There are so many people in the world who overcome obstacles and hardships and I can’t even manage to make myself into a person that I don’t despise. There are people who have real struggles and they are so much stronger than I am. Those people don’t sit alone in their room and cut themselves because they had a bad day. nI’ve recently met a guy who I can honestly say I see a future with. He is so kind and patient. He takes time to support me and tell me he cares for me. He reassures me when I start to spiral and he’s never not there for me. I appreciate him so fucking much but I feel so horribly guilty every time I go to him for comfort. He lost his dad 3 years ago and still struggles to this day. nIt kills me to know that I’m selfish enough to ask him for help when he’s the one who’s actually struggled. He has a reason to be sad. He has a reason to cry at seemingly random times. I want to be there for him and help him whenever he needs it. I want him to be happy but it’s so hard to make him happy when I can be nothing more than a burden to him. nI feel as though I’m in constant need of help but I hate receiving it because the resulting guilt I feel is absolutely overwhelming. I hate needing help because I know that I’m not someone who deserves it. nI waste my parents money. I waste the time and energy of the people I care about. I’m really just a waste of space. I’m insecure and am in need of constant reassurance. I’m constantly scared people are mad at me and I question it so often that eventually people become mad at me because I get so annoying. nI want to be independent but I’m afraid I can’t be. I don’t want to depend on people but I’m terrified that I’m too weak to do this on my own.",1
5955,"broskisendhelp","post","Obsessive/social anxiety/is anyone out there","Ok so basically I’m a 20 year old female in college and I’ve never come close to dating anyone let alone barely even talk to the male gender unless if I’m black out drunk. And what I’ve found what has happened to me about four times ever since high school is that if I get a crush on someone all of four I’ve never even known them personally or ever talked to them except for the last one but who I met once and talked with him normally but I was seriously intoxicated. And these crushes are essentially obsessions since I don’t even know them at all really and will just stalk on social media obsessively and then have all of these hypotheticals and what not in my head like I’m talking to them and sometimes dreams and it’s just the creepiest thing ever and I always try to get myself to stop but I can never find a way. Literally the only way I will completely stop is if I meet/come into contact with the next guy to obsess over. And then after I meet the next guy I legit don’t even think about the past guy for another second ever again and it’s just so stupid I can’t. nnBut it gets even worse because the last guy who I met one year ago at an outside day party in college when I was superrrr drunk and it was fine at first that day bc I was basically blacked but then he started snapping me a few days later and asked me to hang out and I literally couldn’t respond even though I straight up think I sorta liked him (honestly I did but I always tell myself that I didnt to justify myself) and definitely after bc when I stopped talking to him I kept obsessing with him the entire year and beat myself up over it and I regretted it so much. nnBUT it gets even worse. WE MET IN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FALL SEMESTER and maybe snapchatted for a few weeks, and then I saw him like once in person at a party a month later and didn’t say anything, but over the course of that semester I cried drunk and sober about it like 10 times because I don’t know why I’m holding myself back but I JUST COULDNT talk to him without being super stressed and anxious and uncomfortable that I don’t want to at all. And ok then it’s the end of the winter semester SO LITERALLY APRIL and I’m still obsessed but probably not as much but still I haven’t met anyone else New the entire year who I’ve become obsessed with over him. So my friend convinced me to make a tinder and I just got it as a joke AND I SAW HIM COME UP ON MY TINDER AFTER A WHILE and whenever he would come up I would close out of it because I just couldn’t I was so stressed. Ok and then eventually after like a few weeks I went out with my friends drinking and my one friend swiped on him along with a lot of other people and of course it was a match AND THEN HE MESSAGED ME. it takes me like multiple days to respond to him and then he responds in like 6 hours to whatever but the convo makes me cringe to look at it and it just hurts but then I’m legit been obsessed with this guy forever it just makes 0 sense. And then i said when I remembered meeting me and he didn’t exactly remember the time I met him but obviously knew who I was still, and then I’m the one who didn’t respond to him after that when he asked what I was doing this summer because I just can’t. I’ve sorta forgot about him this summer but not really, especially when I am doing nothing productive and just laying around and have nothing better to think about, and it got especially bad tonight that id figure I’d write it out on here . nnSo yeah I’ve told my friends the outline of this but definitely not the details of how I’m super obsessive and creepy because I just think it’s so embarrassing and hate myself. I’m just wondering if anyone else is like this at all in terms of social anxiety or obsessiveness? Or any advice or support that I’m not insane would be greatly appreciated.",0

Is anyone here interested in having an accountability buddy and help each other overcome social anxiety?","Hi,nnI'm 20m and have been suffering from social anxiety for the past 7 years. I think I had enough of just coping and want to get proactive and improve my situation. I've been doing my best to overcome social anxiety for the past 2 years, but I've had relapses. I'm looking for someone in a similar situation that would like to collaborate to overcome social anxiety. I feel like having someone to report to and help me find ways to expose myself to difficult situations would help me overcome this. I would also do the same to you and help you overcome your social anxiety. If you are interested, feel free to PM me or reply to this post. I'll share some details about my anxiety and maybe you can see if you would be interested in working with me on our issues. It doesn't matter if we don't have the same anxieties, but as long as we both have social anxiety and want to overcome it, I'm sure this could work out.nnMy biggest anxiety is using public bathrooms. My issue is that I have performance anxiety when it comes to using urinals. If I am not going after 10 seconds of standing there, I get really anxious and completely get blocked. This is a vicious cycle that makes me afraid that I'll fail to pee, which just makes me anxious when I go the following times. I'm doing my best to do gradual exposure for this issue, but it is very difficult. nnMy next anxiety would be my posture when I am walking or standing. I always feel like I am hunched over, so I retract my shoulder and try to stand tall, but then I get the feeling that I look like I am trying to hard to look confident. This is a never ending cycle that makes it difficult to walk or stand without holding something or having light clothing, such as a t-shirt. nnI'd say that I am an extrovert and have good social skills, but my anxiety is really preventing me from doing some things. I am going to the gym and it helps me a lot for the rest of the day. I also am trying to live a more disciplined life and be more accomplished to feel more confident.nnI know going to the gym helps everyone who goes, but that also going to the gym is a big source of anxiety for many. I'm sure I could help you accomplish that if you are not able to go to the gym at the moment. nnAnyways, I hope I can find someone to work with! I started seeing a therapist for the first time in my life, but I feel like that isn't helping me much.

So they know im not weak for my age. So i told them yeah i don’t mind them coming in.nnSo we got in the doctors room and we are waiting for 5 minutes and the doctor walks in. nHe says hi to me and my mom and then notices my friend and brother sitting in the room too. He then said are you sure you want your brother or friend in here when we do your physical exam? I said i don’t mind. Still not know what that really means.nnThe doctor then said ok can you sit on the bed and take off your jersey? so checked my heartbeat and measured my waist.

I've been taking my meds, booked a visit with a therapist and trying to stay away from the toxic people in my life. I even finished all my college registration stuff. So I decided I was ready to find a job, with the hopes of sticking with it. I somehow got an interview at a hotel as a laundry attendant which I thought might be a good start since it's not too much socialization. Yeah, the manager hated me. He contradicted everything I said. Like he asked me to describe myself and I mentioned being relentless. He replied with 'oh, so you're saying you never ever gave up on anything?' Well yes of course I have, but in the majority of things I keep going! He said it made no sense my last job wouldn't work with my school schedule despite me explaining they required full availability. He asked how I felt about the rain, snow and bad weather and still getting to my job. I explained this never effects me, and never has with previous jobs. I will leave my house early if needed.

5993,"introgirl9","post","I feel like I stopped developing mentally and social at age 8 because I had to take care of my sick mother &amp; my biggest regret.","I want to share my story in hopes to gain some outside perspective. It is a very long story, so I will try to touch on the most important points nnAround when I turned 7 or 8 years old my mom started acting not like herself. She stopped eating dinners with us, she stopped working. She could barely get out of bed. I would ask her if she was sick and she would always tell me it’s something she can’t explain. nnI was always worried sick about her, I loved my mom so much and I hated seeing her like that. The mom I once knew quickly disappeared. We took her to countless specialists and hospitals. She went through electroconculsive therapy. nnEvery time we would go, it would be a different diagnosis. We couldn’t really pinpoint what it was, but probably a mixture of things. She basically thought there was a blockage in her throat preventing her from swallowing or digesting anything, even water. There was another time she had a feeding tube put in her stomach.  I also feel like she was bipolar.. or some sort of major depressive disorder. There was one time she forgot who I was. Another time she would stay up all night looking at furniture catalogs and order thousands of dollars of random office furniture because she wanted to start some sort of “business”. nnShe was also very specific with food. She would only chew and taste but never swallow. And other times she would go to 7-11 and buy endless snacks and junk food to binge eat which always ended in a crying, emotional fit.. nnI wanted anything for her not to be in pain. I truly believed her when she said she had a blockage in her throat no matter what the doctors said. She would always complain the doctors would only stare at the data and never even look at her like a human.nnI did everything for her. I became her ride or die.. And every time she was admitted to another hospital, I would be there until visiting hours ended everyday.nnThere was one time, I must have been about 10 or 11. she decided she wanted to move out with me from the house into a small one bedroom apartment. I don’t know her specific reason, but she just told me she wanted to be away from dad and my siblings and be alone with me. (I have a younger brother and sister as well,poor things) nnWe stayed there for about 6-7 months until one day I found her passed out in the living room when I came home from school  and I had to call an ambulance for her.nnDuring those 6 or 7 months were the worst of it I think.  We moved in during summer break so I didn’t have school for a few months. My mom hated seeing me eat, so I would secretly eat in the bathroom when she was asleep. She also had trouble sleeping so she would always make me stay up with her. She got so weak at one point she couldn’t make it to the bathroom and I had to clean up for her.nnEvery day, every minute I was worried I would lose her. I couldn’t imagine life without her. nnIt sounds chaotic but it was a distinct cycle for my mom-nnHer weight would become dangerously low, so she would have to go live at the hospital. There they would help her gain weight, get her on medication, therapy etc. When she would be healthy enough she would come home. Everything would be fine for a little while. But eventually she would stop taking her medicine. Start restricting and binging again. nnAnd then the cycle starts all over again for years. nnnWell when I turned 13 years old, she was healthy enough to come home from the hospital again.  At this point you could say we were all exhausted of this illness. nnThis time was no different, she did the exact same as before. Slowly stopping her medication. Her weight became dangerously low. My sister and I would take turns massaging her feet and legs all day because she would lose circulation. nnOne night I was in my room, and I heard my mom calling for me to come massage her because her legs were hurting. She called me over and over and I guess I ignored her out of pure laziness. I felt angry at her for being sick. I don’t know why I had to ignore her.nnI decided to take a shower instead. During the middle of my shower my sister comes to me crying saying something is wrong with mom. nnAfter that it was all a blur. nnI am 25 years old now and I feel that I am just beginning to grieve over her after 12 years. I feel that I stopped developing mentally and socially at the age of 8 and I don’t know who I am. I have no personality. I am depressed and always anxious. I have no friends because I always felt I couldn’t relate to my peers. I spent my life after my mom passed running away from everything and finding one distraction after another. I ran away from home as soon as I turned 18 because I couldn’t bear the thought of home without mom. I broke my dad and siblings’ heart and I pushed them away. I still don’t completely understand why I pushed them away so hard. nnI spoke with them for the first time this year in almost 7 years, it’s a huge step but reality is crashing down hard on me right now. I realize now more than ever it will be a long and hard journey that is worth it, for the sake of my family. They are all I have. nnAfter all of these years, I am finally trying to face everything that I’ve been running away from and damn it’s scary.  I miss my mom more than ever.",0

5995,"xlarius","post","When will things ever get better? [rant]","I’ve never spoken out about my problems, and I’m not sure why I’ve come to reddit of all places but I’m just really hoping someone will listen to me and maybe understand...nnBasically my entire life has been revolved around making my mother happy, or her dictating what I can and can’t do. She always emailed my teachers when I was in elementary, middle, and even high school. She didn’t believe I could say what I needed to say or get the help if I didn’t understand something. She had an app that would show her my grades, and anytime I’d get a bad grade I knew that she was going to scold me. Now I fear that I will fail, and I do not know how to cope with failure at all. Whenever I’ve had boyfriends in the past she has always hovered over us 24/7. At 18 I decided to go to the movies with my best friend (he happens to be a guy but our relationship is strictly platonic). In the middle of the movie she turns on the find my iphone alert. Everyone in the theater turns to me because the alert sound is so loud. I have to run outside because I’m so embarrassed. I answer the phone and she’s yelling at me because apparently the map showed that I wasn’t where I told her I was (so she was spying on my location..). We argued and she made up some dumb excuse for why she embarrassed me.. saying the weather was bad and that she was concerned, but that it was my fault because I left when I knew the weather would be bad. I’m 19 now. She has access to all my emails (except one that I use for reddit) and social media. nnI now have social anxiety to the point where my mom has to do everything for me. Anytime our opinions don’t match or I give her “tough love” she tells me she feels betrayed by me. When I order food at restaurants I either let her order for me or I look to her for approval to go ahead and order. It is not even on purpose, it is just habit. When I’m at the doctors office I will explain my issues the best that I can, but she always has to add something because my explanation wasn’t good enough. When I get bad grades, I have a panic attack. I ask myself “what will mom do when she finds out?” I’ve never had a job because I’m too scared to work. My mom is obsessed with my weight. I am 130 pounds and 5 foot exactly. I’m a little on the thicker side but I’m not fat. There have been times when shes grabbed the fat on my arms, my least favorite body part, and said I don’t want my arms to look like “chicken legs” or something like that. I actually don’t normally hate my body, but every time she points something out I start noticing and hating it.nnRecently I went on antidepressants for my social anxiety. It’s only been about a week on them so I don’t expect much difference and there hasnt been yet. I know SSRI’s can take a while to work. I have eaten pretty normally, but my mom is obsessed with weight gain. I know they can make you gain weight, but its like thats all she talks about. These meds make you really tired so i havent been motivated, but she is forcing me to walk in the heat with her. Ive been telling her how tired they make me, but its like she doesnt understand. So I walked with her and afterwards felt so nauseous that i thought i was going to throw up (and i already have once).nnI don’t have anymore friends. I haven’t drove my car once this entire summer, and I hardly leave the house. Somedays I feel like a miserable excuse for a person, and this has made me think suicidal thoughts. The other day my mom actually told me that I don’t have depression because its not as bad as someone else she knows. No, maybe I don’t have “depression” but that doesn’t mean I don’t contemplate death. Before I started this medication I thought about death every single day and never told anyone. I love my mom, but this is the result of helicopter parenting. Now, I can’t even order food for myself or call the doctors office to set up an appointment. I would never want my child to go through what I now go through on a day to day basis. I feel like I’ve regressed back to infancy, always looking to my mom for approval. nnRaising my hand in class is an improvement for me. And that is just sad. At the same time my mom is nagging me to join clubs and make friends and I’m still trying to figure out how to raise my damn hand in class without having a panic attack. But no improvement is ever good enough. If I told her I raised my hand in class for the first time in 6 months she’d tell me that I need to force myself to join a club instead. Then I’m called too sensitive because I regress back into my shell after her statement. And apparently, we don’t believe in congratulating someone for little things like raising their hand because thats nothing. nnI am going to have to see my school counselor once the semester starts. I cannot keep living like this. This isn’t a reality to me. There is no way this is what my life has become. I have so much to say, and so many dreams of my own. I want to be successful. I don’t want to be figuring out how to be normal functioning human when I’m only months away from being 20..nnI’m sorry if this whole thing sounds very melodramatic. I guess it is going to be dramatic for me... i’ve been dealing with it for at least 7 years now. 7 years of social anxiety that has gotten worse and worse over time. I might end up deleting this, idk. I just needed to write this somewhere. I feel so incredibly frustrated and yet completely numb at the same time. I don’t know what to do.",1

6025,"lachgra23","post","Cured my social anxiety","Hi all,  nSo here's my story. I'm a 24 year old male. I developed social anxiety after smoking marijuana and taking LSD at a music festival back in 2015. Before that, I never experienced any sort of social anxiety at all. Afterwards, I honestly found it difficult to socialize with people I had known for years and had no issues with, including my girlfriend at the time. Things got worse and worse. I stopped seeing people, I tried meditation and avoided all social interactions. Sometimes I couldn't even eat with my family. Only a couple of years ago I went on a skiing trip with my family and I was thinking about how anxious I was about social interaction for 3 hours on my way to the mountains, it was totally out of control. I'm sure many of you know the feeling, it is just so dreadful.nnThen things hit a critical point. I was in touch with mental health services already, but I had an argument with my family that led an ambulance to be called, and I was taken to a local hospital and saw a consultant psychiatrist and a doctor who was training to be a psychiatrist. They diagnosed me with psychosis.nnBeing in hospital was terrible. I was there for a total of 3 months over 3 different stays, as it took me ages to really accept the diagnosis from the doctors.nnSo how does this relate to social anxiety? Well, essentially the psychotic thinking created a lot of paranoia in my social interactions, things like ""this person doesn't like me"", or ""this person knows my private thoughts"" or ""my friends can tell that I'm anxious and they are judging me"" etc. Thoughts which I am sure are familiar to many of you.nnFor me the biggest issue was that I was anxious and I felt like people *knew* that I was anxious, and that they were judging me for it, or felt anxious themselves. The problem was that they knew *too much* or saw *too much into* my thinking.nnThis leads me to the conclusion that really, even though my symptoms were *manifesting* as social anxiety, really my social anxiety was just a symptom of a wider mental health issue of psychosis and *paranoia*.nnIt took about 3 years for me to get the psychosis diagnosis. Even though it was a mild set of symptoms, and even though I had symptoms which people would dismiss as normal, I reached a point of crisis which revealed to the psychiatrist that I was experiencing psychosis. I have another friend who has struggled with social anxiety who thinks that the same thing happened to him, that actually the social anxiety was just a symptom of drug induced psychosis instead.nnI am now medicated (Seroquel) and my social anxiety has *completely gone*. My life has *completely* changed. I see people all the time. I go to Uni and study or hang out with people as much as I want to. I have made a bunch of new friends and reconnected with old friends. I go out most weekends. Sometimes with my friends and sometimes alone. Out to bars and meet new people, talk to girls, talk to guys, and generally have a great time.nnI'm not saying you have psychosis. This is just my story. If you have social anxiety, you should go and see a doctor.nnIf you have smoked, snorted, or ingested something which made you feel anxious, paranoid or otherwise unsettled, you should go and see a doctor.nnI am lucky in that the psychosis version of social anxiety is really easy to fix, all I needed was medication. There is someone somewhere here lurking on this subreddit with the same situation, I hope that I can help that person and I wish all of you luck in defeating that shit, because it is bloody horrible.",1

I think the people in the office have (unfortunately) caught on to the fact I'm pretty shy and quiet (and this is exacerbated by the fact they're all older than me) but it's okay for the most part because i can kind of get away with it.nnAnyway I have a bit of a crush on the colleague who was in the cafe (not that I would ever pursue anything) so I'm already shyer around him than the rest. He's attractive and very very nice and makes and effort to talk to me if we see each other.nnI didn't expect to see him at all in the hotel so already I felt a bit caught off guard. I went over and said hi and he offered me a coffee. I felt so awkward though I immediately declined (much too quickly, because I was nervous) and he kind of just gave me a blank look (probably thinking 'what could she possibly have to do' because it's the weekend). I immediately felt like kicking myself because I actually am doing nothing and should've just sat and chatted with him. There was an awkward silence and I kind of just floundered, wringing my hands, and didn't give any excuse, just said something like 'oh yeah I'm living in this hotel' as if that was an explanation. Then he asked me for how much longer I was staying with the newspaper to do the internship and I kid you not my mind went completely blank and it literally took my five seconds of uhm-ing and ah-ing to answer him :/ I could literally see him staring at me like 'what the fuck'. He asked me with section i was working with and thankfully took charge of the convo and started talking animatedly about things (most of which went in one ear and out the other because I was still mentally kicking myself). Anyway then at the next awkward silence I said I hope he enjoys his lunch and that I would see him soon and I left.nnI just feel so awful because a) I haven't embarrassed myself that badly in front of someone in a while and b) I hope it didn't come across like i didn't want to have coffee with him because ironically I did and I hope he wasn't offended. The thing is, I've talked to him before and been way calmer because I anticipated the conversation and so could prepare for it. He must have been surprised to see me in such an awkward such and it sucks. I feel like now he won't really bother to make conversation with me. He was also probably thinking 'wow, she's an intern with all my expertise at her disposal and she declines?!' - like he could've actually taught me a lot and I know he's had an interesting career and ughhh I feel so shit right now. Also, I hope he didn't catch on that I have a crush on him, that would be horrid :( nnSorry for this ramble, any solidarity would be great :(",0

He’s very very very shy and doesn’t say much generallyn2. He’s quite hesitant to go out anywhere, as he’s always worrying about stuff happeningn3. He’s very self conscious and hates being the centre of attentionn4. If he has to do public speaking, he will absolutely freak out and runn5. He can’t make eye contact at all, not even for a couple of seconds, he says it’s really uncomfortable and scaryn6. When we hang out in public places he quite often complains it’s too loud which I don’t really get, but he seems to find a lot of places too loud to bare, and wants to leaven7. He’s really really awkward. I mean this in the nicest way humanly possible, but the word that best describes him is “dense”. He’s really really literal, takes everything seriously, and rarely picks up on social cues. n8. He has these weird panic attacks fairly often. Where he goes completely silent, gets quite upset and shaky, hyperventilates, and starts acting a bit differently. For example, one of these happened yesterday, and he started rocking backwards and forwards a little, and started fidgeting a lot with his fingers, while breathing pretty heavily and not saying anything. I don’t really know what goes on in his head during these panic attacks, he hates talking about themn9. When he does talk, he struggles to control the speed of his talking. He will quite often keep speeding up while talking, and end up talking so fast he loses a lot of fluency and becomes rather hard to understand. He will misspeak a lot, some of his words will blur together, and he stammers a little, before getting frustrated and then getting really upset and needing to take a minute to calm himself down (which he isn’t very good at doing!)n10. He pretty much doesn’t talk to someone he’s only just met, it takes him a pretty long time to get comfortable around them to talk more than just a mumbled “hi”n11. He absolutely hates physical contact. Touching his arm makes him recoil and squirm. n12. He’s very easily flustered, and blushes a lot.n13. He’s very very naive and innocent, so he quite often gets me to explain explicit jokes to himn14. He’s incapable of talking to girls. He completely freezes up and blushes.n15. He gets quite frustrated very easily, and also cries quite easily, like when he gets frustrated. n16. He is a very anxious person and worries a lot about really small things, and worst case scenarios, however unlikely. nnSorry for the long post, I wanted to write down as much as I could think of, since I’d really like to help him, so I figured  here was the best place to ask for advice!nnThanks",0
6047,"Lailled","post","Is this social anxiety?","**16/M.** I have had these problems since I started high school when I was 11 (5 years).nnI've made a document listing the causes, symptoms and fixes of what I believe to be social anxiety. I really don't know if I really do have a problem or if my problems aren't actually real and I just need to ""get over it"" and that they are just general teenage hormones. I want to ask my doctor for a diagnosis but I'm scared that he/she will just laugh it off and not take it serious.nnFrom the ages of 1-6, I lived with both parents. My Dad was abusive to my Mum. I vividly remember her sobbing behind a locked bathroom door. This probably caused some underlying psychological problems. From ages 6-14, I didn't see my Dad once. My Mum died when I was 14 which my Dad took advantage by trying to get back into my life. I don't know if I can trust him. I want to but I don't think I can. All of my life, I have had terrible relationships and outlooks on society because of my broken family which I assume is the reason for my lack of trust around other people.nn&amp;#x200B;nn    Causes:nnGetting ready for school, walking to school and being at school causes the most anxiety in my life. Being at school causes the most anxiety of the 3. Followed by walking to school and getting ready for school. I can control my anxiety the most when it is at its lowest levels. So, the anxiety when **getting ready for school** (showering, getting dressed, eating breakfast, checking that I have everything for the day) can be managed the most out of the 3. I find it very hard to manage my anxiety on **the way to school**. My anxiety **at school** is **completely out of my control**. Although I am not always anxious at school, the majority of the time (95% of the time), I am very anxious. I have no idea how I can control it at all. Nothing works. Things that work at home, don't work at school and I can’t think rationally.nn    Symptoms:nn* Sweatingn* Goosebumpsn* Tense vocal cords n* Can’t speak loudly in crowded placesn* Blocked nosen* Tics - constant fiddling with things in my hands, repetitive biting/grinding on back teeth, forcing myself to exhale airn* Biting lip/tucking it into my mouthn* Jaw feels heavy - I don’t know how to relax my jawn* Constantly out of breathn* Feeling like I am on the verge of cryingn* Shaky/jittery neck when looking aroundn* Generally feeling on edge when people can see me.n* Constant fear of being abandoned by the people that I am hanging out withn* Constant fear of being confrontedn* An urge to escape from the room that I am inn* Hard to swallow/unable to swallow normallyn* Fear of making eye contact/negatively evaluating any eye contact that I maken* A voice in my head telling me how people think of me (always negative thoughts)n* Generally feeling empty of emotions but racing with negative thoughtsn* Feeling drained once my anxiety goes away (after school)n* Constantly dreading every part of my school dayn* General low self esteem, confidence and just a shitty feeling through my bodyn* Feeling and believing that there is no way out of my anxiety - From my experience, there simply isn’t an escape!n* &amp;#x200B;nn&amp;#8203;nn    Things that help:nn* When at school, going inside a toilet cubicle (where I’m secluded from people) reduces my anxiety drastically. I still feel anxious but it is a lot more bearable. I think that if I was in a fully enclosed opaque and sound-proof box, my anxiety would drop to 0.n* Boxing/punching bag at homen* Going for a walk (if my anxiety is low-medium. If it is high, like when at school, it makes things worsen* Crying/breaking down - This is hard to do, though, because I can’t cry much. So it isn’t a sustainable technique. I also don’t have any privacy to cry - both at school and at home.n* Weed can reduce the physical symptoms. After smoking, I feel more comfortable in my body but I still have the same anxious thoughts.",0

Due to social anxiety it’s been really hard for me to make friends. By the age of 15 I wouldn’t speak at school, I would literally go days in school without speaking a single word to anyone. It got to the point where I couldn’t order my own food. I graduated with no friends to take pictures with, not even the teachers really knew me because I just never spoke. Graduated high school, didn’t go to college and I couldn’t get a job because the thought of having to interact with people everyday mortified me. Fast forward to age 20 I got my first job as a cashier, I forced myself to. I lost 10 pounds in 1 week because I was so anxious. I quit after 2 months because it became unbearable for me. After I quit, I realized I had gotten much better with social anxiety. Due to the constant interaction with hundreds of people everyday, I became less scared of taking to people. I could order my own food, go to places alone, talk to strangers at times. After this I went back to college, and at age 22 I got another job. This time as a barista. I thought maybe if I had more forced social interaction I’d become better with social anxiety. And I did, I became much better, but not to the point I wanted to. At work I still found myself holding back from talking. From being my true self. I’d only talk to my coworkers when necessary and I literally was not able to be myself. It felt paralyzing. I got the “you don’t talk much” or “you’re so quiet” from my coworkers constantly. When I wanted to speak up about something, just talk about something funny or interesting I saw, I couldn’t! I can’t describe how horrible of a feeling that is. I felt like my younger self back in middle and high school, when I’d go days without speaking to anyone.  I’m now 24, in college still and I still struggle with social anxiety. I can pretty much do anything and live a normal life. I can go to doctors appointments, order my own food, etc. I’m self sufficient, but I still struggle with just being myself around people and I have zero friends. I struggle with just talking and expressing myself, the paralyzing feeling. I haven’t had friends in over 10 years and it’s due to my social anxiety. I want to make friends here at college. It’s my first semester at this new one I transferred to. I’ve joined multiple clubs and met lots of people. But I can’t seem to be myself ever, only speaking when necessary and I hate it! Does anyone have any tips or advice for me. My journey with social anxiety has been a long and draining one and I feel like it’s taking over my life again. All I would like is to be able to make friends. Sorry if this is sloppy but I’m feeling kind of desperate right now.",0
6052,"zeaNN1","post","[18M] University fresman here, who needs some honest advice about what to do with my life","Hey, I'm new here so please bear with me, this is gonna be long.nnSo, a little bit about me: I have just moved to a new country to study at a pretty decent university - away from my only two close friends. Those are basically the only people I talk to and now here I am, only the other side of the planet with absolutely no one I know. Also, you can add extreme social anxiety (and years of untreated depression) to the list so yeah, making new friends is an extremely hard challenge for me and before I came here, I promised myself that I'd try my best to change up. I was also thinking about going to a therapist but there are 2 problems with that; I don't have money for it and my parents think it's a waste of money, and I've had bad experience with therapists in the past, who didn't help me at all and I've also spent my entire summer's student job salary to that...nnUni until now consisted of lectures and no social interaction at all. Yesterday, I've been to my first small classroom lesson, which was hands off the worst 2 hours of my life. We were supposed to introduce ourselves and work in groups etc. I tried to look approachable and put on my friendly face (or at least tried) Also, I've never done this before, but I tried to do some small talk with others (if you didn't notice, English is not my first language so that doesn't really help) but I got some cold 1-2 word answers from the people around me and they ignored every attempt and literally turned away from me (and I swear it wasn't awkward or forced, just the casual bullshit small talk people tend to enjoy). I mean come on ffs, whenever I'm somewhere at school and literally ANYONE comes up to me, I always try to act the nicest and friendliest way possible and not like an asshole...After that, I was like fuck this and just stared at my laptop for the entire session without talking to anyone. Others were talking and having good laughs, and I was just sitting there counting the minutes so that I could leave. We will have 5-6 classes like this every week and I'm sure I won't be able to sit through these classes without losing my mind.nnI have zero fucking idea if I wanna do the course I'm studying at the moment (and if it's worth suffering every week for something I'm not even sure I wanna do). I'm just going with the flow so if I fail and drop out, it's not the end of the world. The problem is that I don't know what I REALLY want to do with my life. My main concern about making any big change is that I'm still on my parents' money and I could only be able to get a shitty part time student job next to uni. And you guessed it, they only support me financially if I study here, at uni.nnWhat would you do if you were me? Anything is appreciated, really(:",1

I am in a new school this year and it's been pretty stressful so far. I stayed in school for half the year my freshman year, and went ahead to do online school for the rest of the year. It was horrible. I thought I would have liked being alone, and I thought it would be easier but no. I was so depressed. I have no friends, and I just smoked weed and stayed in bed everyday. Never went outside. So I thought that going back to school would be better for me and I'd be happier. I was really confident in myself that I would make myself talk to people, and make friends and just be myself. I haven't really made any friends, and i'm sure everyone thinks i'm awkward. I twitch randomly because i'm always anxious. And my head starts to shake when i'm having a panic attack. I always think everyone is judging me on how I look, because i'm growing out my super short hair, and I just think I look really ugly right now. I was surprised when this boy asked me out to homecoming, and I was happy. But the thing is, I never talked to him after that, I get too nervous, and I never know what to say. He then told me that he couldn't go because he wasn't 16 and his parents wouldn't let him. I immediately knew this was some excuse not to go with me, because i'm weird and don't talk. I didn't go to homecoming, and apparently he went. So yeah..I was right. I have just been really depressed lately, and skip school sometimes. Worrying all the time is so exhausting, i'm always tired.  I try to have a different mindset about things, and I really try to be positive sometimes. But other times I really just can't. Most days I go to school and I feel as if nothing is real, and that i'm in some sort of dream. We had to read stories to kindergartners yesterday, and I thought it would be just one on one. But we had to do it in front of our classmates too. I know that's really stupid to worry about, because little kids look up to older ones. And I should have just been strong and done it. But I was freaking out and just left. I just grabbed my backpack and left school. And just cried in my bed the rest of the day, thinking about how much of a loser I am. I've seen multiple therapists and school counselors and I can never open up, nothing has helped except for maybe a breathing technique. I have trust issues from being bullied back in 7th grade. I really just need some positive feedback right now, and to know I am not alone...",1

In fact, I can hear them putting their dishes away. I haven't eaten a damn thing today because I'm so terrified that one of them will try to talk to me if I go into the kitchen.nnGrowing up, i was the physical embodiment of panic disorder. I cried at everything, couldnt socialize properly, and was the ""weird"" kid. No medications changed that, and I hopped from psychologist to psychiatrist to w/e constantly.  i can say that i ""grew out of it"" when i transferred to a better school, with a clean slate and no ""crybaby"" reputation.nnI found out last year that I'm autistic (aspergers), and every time a psychologist tried to tell my parents that while i was growing up, they'd reject it and throw me at a different counselor. I just had anxiety, and they raised me like thats all it was, so that i wouldnt have any trouble careerwise in the future.nnI spent my entire highschool years with absolutely zero friends, but it didn't really matter. I somehow got over the social anxiety, and as long as nobody was being confrontational or rude to me, I was fine talking to strangers, working in group projects, etc. I didnt mind not having any real friends. Not to mention the fact that i came out as a trans guy, and now i was known more of a ""special snowflake"" student. I just avoided talking to people.nncollege comes along and I'm in community college for a semester. classwork partners were shocked to find i had talked to literally nobody the entire time, but i dropped out after realizing that i wanted to go to art school instead. i also quit my job (working fast food was hard for me, but not impossible. i just didnt talk to anyone. i got a job in a distribution warehouse and it was much easier).nnnow, I live in the middle of nowhere. theres not a single art school in my state, and since my parents are paying for college, they didnt want to send me out of state either, in fear of my anxiety coming back without home there to be a safe space.nni found an online art school, and thought i was golden. but it gets rocky here.nnsince becoming a student, i've spent no less than 12 hours a day in one single room. it's an accelerated program, so it takes a LONG time for me to actually complete my lessons. the pressure to get nothing less than an A in every class is extreme, since the tuition is so insanely high. nnspending my entire life in two rooms (the office and my bedroom) was originally fine, and i still have no problem on that regard. but my family spent the first few months of my education with no houseguests. I had to go to my brother's wedding (being a very obviously transitioning FTM guy in a bridesmaid dress = me hiding in the bathrooms every opportunity available), and the paranoia and fight-or-flight feelings were so bad that i was shaking. nnAnd now, i'm sitting here, typing this while listening to my brother's friends laugh and talk about me being ""socially inept"" downstairs. I can't tell exavtly what they're saying, but i can hear the word ""she"" over, and over, and over.nnI don't even care that they're misgendering me at this point. I just hate how I went from having almost no social awkwardness to not even being able to eat dinner with anyone who isnt direct family. This deterioration happened in a matter of months. I just realized I've been socially isolated. there have been weeks where i havent talked to anyone except friends online. I'm 19. I shouldnt be making up excuses as to why i cant walk downstairs.",1

We went to a restaurant I loved, and she said we could never go back because they took the pasta she likes off the menu.nnShe makes comments about the way I look and my personality. I told her I was harassed and bullied so severely in high school. She has made comments about how my hair looks fake and overprocessed. I go to school and sometimes work as a freelancer. She's made comments to me sometimes when we hang out like ”SOME OF US have work in the morning”nnShe says I ask too many questions because usually when I see my friends, I want to know what's going on in their lives. She doesn't ask many about me. I've gotten upset about her questions comments, but a mutual friend who I used to date says ”she probably thinks you ask too many questions or talk too much because she never stops talking about herself.” she's made comments like ”you either say nothing or express too much Love you though.”nnI sometimes binge drink when I'm stressed.

But when it comes to interacting with people I am totally useless. I mess up my words, speak unclearly, miss things people say, forget stuff that I was just told, act incompetently when under pressure and get confused very easily. Is it possible to get into and finish university (History BA) while being intellectually disabled? I guess it's possible. Maybe that's the root of my SA. Dyslexia is also common in my family, verbal expression is an issue for me as well as spelling and grammar.nnI have just got my first job at 21, it's so late because my anxiety has made going out and finding one difficult. On the advice of a psychologist I went for a job where I would be interacting with people a lot in order to help with my SA, so I started casual work at a golf club bar/restaurant. But I think the reason I have this anxiety is because of how much I mess things up. Other people just seem to be able to interact almost seamlessly, they joke (I don't really have a sense of humour), fully understanding each other, speaking clearly without occasionally totally tripping over their words like I do. I feel like I am missing that part of me that can connect with people. I just don't know how to even though I want to, I come off as weird, boring and incredibly awkward. It's so lonely. I also fit the criteria for what some people describe as wet blankets or wimps. nnAlso even if I don't know if I'm 'not all there', or whatever term you call it. I think other people do assume I have those kind of issues. My older brother has told me when I was younger I have 'a little something' (mind you he is a narcissist and thinks he is smarter than literally everyone). But, there are also lots of other suggestions other people see me like this. For example, the till was 9 pounds short at the end of the day yesterday (almost definitely on account of my incompetence), and because the people I work with are nice people they tried to trick me into thinking they had found a missing receipt that made up the difference. When it was very clear the issue was to do with the cash (receipts are only kept for card payments) as they had said it was cash earlier and they left 9 pound missing on the board. Also the receipt they found was for 20 odd quid ahaha (which was even mentioned when they found it). They must really think I am totally not there. It makes me wonder how much I am lied to in order to make me feel better and don't pick it up.nnI don't know what to do, people hate incompetent or stupid people because they make their lives harder. I feel like that may be the underlying thing causing my anxiety. (Although to anyone reading it should be noted underlying intellectual problems causing SA is often not the case). My looks also don't help with the way I'm seen. I just feel like if I'm totally incompetent and can't connect with anyone then I am always going to be miserable. That's not pessimistic, it's just reality. nnIf I could leave that would be fine with me but I can't because it would hurt my family and friends (much more family tho).nnI don't know what to do about this. I'm not sure there is a lot I can do if I'm right.nnThanks for reading",1

The problem is the anxiety doesn't get better for me, it's like it's intensified with each interaction; I can't help being awkward as hell and then beating myself up about it afterwards. I then want to isolate myself and not interact with anyone even more cause I feel I'm hopeless at it, an embarrassment, people deserve better than me, etc.nnYesterday for example as I was woofing down my lunch during my 15 minute work break in the breakroom, the others were having a conversation and I was too shy to join in beyond the odd stupid remark here and there, and when they turned to look at me I felt like they were thinking ""what the hell is he on about?"". nnThen my (waaay out of my league) crush who works in another department, who's super friendly towards me and the complete opposite personality-wise (extroverted, confident, bubbly etc.), comes in and starts chatting to me asking me questions etc., but I was too shy to respond beyond really short awkward responses and just asked her a couple of questions before sitting silently. Then she sat opposite me and I kept awkwardly catching her looking at me, too shy to say anything and didn't even say goodbye when I had to dash off (though I could hear her saying ""byeee-"" as I was closing the door, but I didn't turn back to respond...). nnSorry for venting, I just fucking hate how I'm like this and so socially inept and overthink everything - I know it's ""in my head"" but don't know how to stop it (alcohol helps immensely but as an alcoholic I don't touch a drop anymore). The odd thing is I have no problem when I'm ""performing/acting"" - working as a waiter and kid's party host (my two current part-time jobs) and doing some threatre and musical performing, I don't have a problem cause I'm playing a scripted role/character, I'm not being myself/no one knows the ""real me"", and it's not a proper personal social interaction. nn...But when I'm actually having to talk to people socially and authentically and ""be myself"", I get so anxious and clam up and sort of retreat into myself, and basically want to disappear into the floor lol. It's just a different ball game entirely and I can't manage to translate that performing/acting approach to it (I know Shakespeare says ""life is a stage"" but damnit real life is much harder to perform lol). People say ""be your best self, act how you wish you could act"" etc. but it's like there's some invisible fucking barrier there and I can't push through it.nnI can't even do normal shit like go shopping and get a coffee without having to mentally prep myself a lot and push through super nervousness. I've been like this for 21 years and I've only gotten worse overtime, nothing I've tried works and there's no end in sight, I have no clue how to fix myself and stop my skills and confidence eroding further.nnI'm not that social anyway but still I have no real friends and have never kissed a girl or been in a relationship - people constantly give me shit about it and act surprised cause apparently I'm ""attractive"" (though I feel they just say that to try boost my confidence), but it's disheartening nonetheless.nnI don't really know where I'm going with this post, I guess I'm just venting cause I'm sick and tired of being like this, and having no relationships with people (platonic, romantic, whatever) as a result, and it's also just a big hindrance to me being able to perform/progress in school, at work etc. nnIf anyone has any advice or tips or reassurance whatsoever I'd love to hear it, but if you read this far thank you so much and have a nice day. &lt;3",0

I kicked the product away, told them that it was ok because I moved it over. This of course angered Kyle, who then launched into a rant about me being a ""smartass""... so I told him he needed to ""quit being a dick"". Every customer in the store who witnessed this was openly concerned for me and some even apologized for Kyle's actions. nnIt felt amazing to stick up for myself and my coworker.

6110,"smashingyngman","post","Emotional Isolation.","The last psychiatrist that I saw monthly, who also diagnosed me with Social Anxiety (and Avoidant Personality Disorder) listed 'Emotional isolation"" as one of my personality traits.nnThis makes sense, because I used to bottle up A LOT of emotions as a kid, and would eventually blow up on bullies at school. I eventually dropped out in 9th grade, just to get away from them. Beyond that, my home life was shitty; my dad was an abusive alcoholic, and we avoided each other, despite living in the same house for years. He was clearly unhappy with himself, so he used me as his scapegoat..while tearing down every single thing about me that he possibly could. Who would want to be around that on a daily basis? Our relationship is still strained, but at least we occasionally talk to each other or text nowadays. Some things never change.nnI hate to say it, but the emotions that I've felt the most throughout my entire life are mainly anger, sadness, and tons of apathy.nnWhat is Emotional Isolation, though?nnI'd say, for me at least, that it's like feeling alone, despite having any intimate or platonic relationship. Hardly anyone ""understands"" me (especially family members, the people who I'm actually close to in this world). It's pretty easy to keeping my feelings for other people distant. I don't like feeling vulnerable..especially when I can't tell if they feel the same way.nnWorst of all, I'm completely fine going for days without interacting with other people...even over social media. I hardly ever feel lonely, despite wanting a girlfriend/romantic relationship. That really bothers me..because humans are innate social creatures; it's why some people consider ""solitary confinement"" for prisoners to be torture.nnRather than interact with kids/teenagers my own age in my youth, after dropping out of school, I'd literally stay in my room all day, just listening to music and drinking alcohol or finding a substance to tune everything out with. That clearly wasn't healthy, and most likely exacerbated this ""isolating"" problem. I did this for years, up until at least my mid 20s.nnIt's taken at least three years of Behavioral Health and several anti-depressant cocktails to even feel somewhat ""normal"". I honestly didn't have a full time job until I was 29 years old.nnI still find it very difficult to emotionally express myself, and literally every psychiatrist I have seen thinks that I have a ""flat affect"" and am emotionally blunt. I've never dated, or really gone out of my way to express my infatuation for someone else. I can see how being distant like this could easily be a problem in a relationship anyway.nnI just want to finally -feel- and be normal...whatever that is.nnDespite the apathy, can anyone relate?

Like anyone, I've had my highs and lows over the years. For the past year now, I'd say I'm doing pretty decent depression-wise (about an 8 on a scale from 1-10, 1 being terrible and 10 being great). On the other hand, however, my social anxiety has definitely been worsening. My occupation requires constant public speaking and my love and passion for it has been completely overshadowed by my social anxiety. It's more so the physical symptoms that I have the hardest time dealing with. I can talk myself through the nerves in my head with ease, but it doesn't translate physically. My hands, legs, and voice will start shaking and that's if I even manage to get anything out! Basically, it's been ruining my life. This is why I've been strongly considering asking my psychiatrist about getting me started on beta blockers. nnMy question to you all is: if you do suffer from depression as well, have beta blockers worsened it for you? My second question is: how long do you have to be on beta blockers to notice a difference?",1
6112,"throwaway83784627","post","Can't approach my lecturer","I (17f) have generalised anxiety and pretty severe social anxiety. I'm a student at sixth form, and while it's miles better than secondary school, it comes with its fair share of problems. In my old school, the support system they had was terrible, and did nothing to help ease my social anxiety. I was referred there three times by two different teachers, and they still did nothing to help. My teachers themselves wouldn't lift a finger until I was having full-on meltdowns in the middle of class. Even then, one of them just stood and watched while some girls I barely knew were the ones to reassure me. Because of all this, I sort of developed a distrust for teachers and lecturers in general. In sixth form, my lecturers have all been as supportive as they can, but my anxiety has led me to doing and turning in work late and skipping class (I haven't skipped since last year, though), and sometimes just the thought of work stresses me out. All three of my lecturers have spoken to my mum on the phone about my anxiety, and they've offered support where needed. But I still struggle to approach them or admit when I need help. It's gotten to the point where I have to communicate to my literature lecturer through my mum, and she emails him when whenever I have an issue. This is just until he gets to know me better, since he only started this year. Even though my other two lecturers have encouraged my mum to tell me to approach them in person if I need help, this is extremely difficult for me. Mainly because I worry about wasting their time, in case they're busy if I try to speak to them after class or when I have a free period. I don't want to become a nuisance to them, but I feel like I am.  nnnOne of the A-Levels I'm studying is film. It's always been my favourite class, and I've had almost no problems with the classwork itself. I get consistent Bs in all of my graded essays. The problem I have now is my coursework. Basically, the coursework I'm doing is I'm writing a screenplay and creating a digital storyboard to go alongside it. The screenplay was difficult enough to deal with - I've received positive feedback for the idea itself, but it took me 2 months just to look at what my lecturer had written on the first draft, because one of the things I struggle the most with is criticism. My therapist has tried to help me to not take it personally, but to no avail. When I did eventually look back and do my corrections, I was a shaking and crying mess. It was so draining.  nnnI recently got my second draft back, which I'm planning to look at soon. My main problem now is the storyboard. The formatting is sort of difficult, but that isn't my main concern. My main concern is that I need to take photos for the storyboard. I doubt I'll struggle in terms of a camera, but for the photos themselves I'll need three girls around my age. I only have 2 close friends at my sixth form (one of which is a boy). I have other friends, but no one I trust enough to ask. Even if I do find 3 girls, where will I find the time? Where will they find the time? Everyone's schedule will probably differ, plus I need to take the photos in the sixth form because of where the story is set. So doing it outside of sixth form is a big no. I can't even ask my close friends to hang out with me, so I just can't see myself doing that.  nnnThe final draft is due in soon, and if I hand in a storyboard with no photos, my lecturer will lose it. He's nice enough in class, albeit slightly awkward, but he's really strict about coursework and deadlines. I have no idea what to do. Even if I do ask him for help, I'm worried he's going to get mad at me and ask why I didn't approach him sooner. I know I should've, but I can't turn back time. I have no idea how to explain my distrust towards him, I don't think I even should. It really isn't against him personally, it's against teachers and lecturers in general. Plus, I doubt there's much he can do about it. He can't exactly go and tell me to find friends. But I feel like this is the only option I have left. I'm starting to severely worry about my future, it's at the point where I've made myself ill with worry and I spent two days off last week. Does anyone have any idea how I approach him about this? I'm tempted to do it over email, but my mum said I have to get used to speaking to him in person, so I'm not sure. What should I say to him?",1

6115,"ding3","post","My struggles with social anxiety","I had pretty severe social anxiety coupled with depression in high school and a fair bit of college. I experienced most/all of the things you mention. nnI wouldn’t go anywhere for weeks for fear of people seeing me. I was terrified if I went outside to get the mail that a neighbor would see me and judge me. I’d only go grocery shopping at bizarre hours and only use the self check out because of fear of what the cashier would think of me and my purchases. nnGoing to any social event caused panic attacks (sweating, trembling, trouble breathing, chest pain, dizziness). I lived a solitary life and would go months without social interaction. Going so long without having so much as a conversation made me really awkward in any social interaction that I did have. I would be really quiet and keep to myself. Afterwards I’d over-analyze everything that happened, even for days or weeks.nnSo how did I climb out…? Very slowly.nnI have been on and off antidepressants (SSRIs) since I was 15, never on for longer than 3 months, then I would hop back on when I started to feel really down. I think they helped with the depression, but not so much the social anxiety. I have been on and off therapy as well…and couldn’t really commit to that either. nnIt’s hard to go tell someone your most intimate feelings and thoughts when you’re afraid of how they’re judging you. However, I think it does help some people. I was recommended this [book](https://amzn.to/2lnjT93). It might help.nnI made one friend towards the end of high school. I had no idea why he wanted to be my friend, but I was so desperate for a friend I just went with it. I found it much easier to just hang with 1 person than a large group that I didn’t know. Then I made one really good friend in my first year of college. She much more actively took action to become my friend, than me becoming hers. We became basically inseparable, and she was my only friend for a while but that was okay because all my social needs were met through her. nnI transferred schools and she got a boyfriend and our very codependent relationship kinda fell apart. I felt lost for a while, but that is when I realized that I shouldn’t be that dependent on someone else. I made a friend at my new school. I moved on campus and started interacting more with my roommates. I became involved with clubs. I started by just attending talks and meetings, then eventually went onto becoming an officer. A lot of classes were team projects, so I befriended some teammates. I took a teaching assistant position and met people that way. As my circle of friends grew, I met more friends through them. I threw some parties. I went to parties. I learned that sometimes you have to be assertive when making friends. I faked confidence and asked people to hang out, chatted them up online, said hi and talked to them when I saw them. Eventually, it starts to feel less forced and more natural. By the time I graduated I had a great group of friends ranging from very close to not so close.nnIt wasn’t smooth sailing always. I had a really hard time during my internship. I didn’t fit in with the other interns at all. It was like they just looked at me and labeled me as a loser. I felt very socially awkward since most of my friends were also very nerdy/geeky and the interns were a different breed. I did try, but I failed and it was a hard summer for me. I spent most my weekends alone while the others were out doing what interns should do when spending the summer in a beautiful new city.nnAbout 6 months ago I moved to a new city, and it’s been tough making friends and adjusting. I feel the insecurities and low self-esteem creeping in on me. I hated constantly meeting new people and small talk. I’m so paranoid that people will see through my confident veneer and find me to be just a giant loser. I miss the easiness with my friends. I tried organizing events with some people at work, but those fell through. Sucks being in a new city with so much to do, but no one to do with it. In the back of my mind, I still fear that if I go do things alone people will see me think of me as a friendless loser.nnAs you can see it’s still a struggle sometimes, but I know I’ve come a long way. I don’t think I’ll ever be the life of the party or 100% not socially awkward. I still have fears and insecurities, but I think the best way to get over them is to just face them. Sometimes you’ll fail real hard, but you’ll learn and get better. I know it’ll be a while before I build a social network like the one I had in college. I’m gonna try taking a fun class after work, meetup.com, and finding a place to volunteer. I’m planning on facing my fear of doing things alone…and I’m gonna go out there and do things alone and hopefully make friends along the way.nn[part II (Julie)](https://sadbuster.info/2019/09/26/my-social-anxiety-and-how-i-overcame-it/)",1
6117,"rentagirl94","post","I just need to tell my story somewhere.","For the last week or so, I've really been needing to get this out, and as it stands now, I don't have many people in my life I'd be willing to spill this to. I suffered a few different traumas from the ages of 14 to 21. It was like something different happened every 2-3 years. I won't get into that too much here, but what I will say is that I'm an orphan, and I'm unable to maintain any intimate relationships. I don't feel bad for myself (most of the time). I'm thankful for the things that have made me stronger. I'm thankful that things weren't much worse for me. Regardless, I'm still dealing with the aftermath. I'm 25 now, and I feel like I'm just starting from the beginning. The years that were crucial for development of social relationships, interests, talents, a career path, I spent being sad and trying to make sense of everything. I made a move to a big city recently and I've noticed that I can't look people in the eye or have conversations. I just freeze up. I suppose I've always been like this, but I guess it's just magnified now that I'm realizing that I'm 25 and basically alone now. Having moved is making me extra vulnerable as well. Most days I don't even want to leave the apartment. nnI want to make friends. If I have to be alone family and relationship wise, I'd like to at least have a group of people to spend time with outside of work. I'm not really sure how to approach all of this, but it's stressing me out and I'm starting to think I might just die alone. I think I have my guard up because I'm afraid of being alone. I'm afraid of rejection. nnAlso, you know how I mentioned the teenage and young adult traumas? Well I feel like it completely consumed me and now I feel like I don't know who I am. How can I explain this? It's like this: when I was a youngster I used to love singing and playing the guitar. I'd learn a bunch of cover songs, and there was a group of other young people who were also involved in the small town coffee shop music scene. We had a fucking blast. But then my mom got diagnosed with cancer and I completely shut down. I was 14, and I lost almost every single relationship and and friendship I had forged. After my moms illness I moved around a lot from foster care to family to boyfriends. I never had strong ties to either side of the family, but after my mom died, ties to her side were all but severed. I ran off with an older man for a while and my passion for music fizzled out almost completely. Looking back on my teen years, on having spent most of them in terrible relationships, on having lost both my mother and father and having no real relationship with any of my family, I realize that all of that time I could have spent building healthy friendships, learning about who I am, and what I like, finding new hobbies and passions. It was all wasted on shitty things that I didn't ever ask for. On being sad, in despair constantly. The chronic stress has affected my health. They say that when you experience trauma while your brain is still developing, it can cause brain damage. I believe it. I have depression and anxiety that I fight with every single day. I can't focus, I can hardly think straight, brain fog all the time, I have trouble retaining knowledge. I'm trying to be happier and healthier now and I'm getting better every day, but I wish I were more developed as a person at the age of 25. nnThere was a point to all of that. I know that all of that stuff combined are the causes for my social anxiety. The whole thing is so much more complex than what I feel comfortable explaining on the internet, but so much of my trauma ties into social relationships and my intense fear of letting people in. I can't wait until I can get therapy. I need to sort this entire mess out. I wish I'd have started a long time ago because I feel like it's going to take years to heal. nn Anyways if you made it this far thank you for reading what I had to say. I hope you all have a wonderful day or night. nnnTl;dr: I'm fucking lonely/alone. Teenage/young adulthood traumas stunted my emotional/intellectual/social growth.

Well anyways, I popped some edibles right before it began and it seemed everything was going good. I had a great theater experience the first time I watched it and I was looking forward to seeing Green Goblin whoop some ass again, only this time in IMAX. Well right as its about to begin these two guys walk in and sit one seat away from me. They began whispering to each other and making jokes almost immediately. It didn't bother me that bad at first, because I figured they'd stop eventually. But nope! As the movie went on not only did they talk more and more, but they were getting progressively louder. I'm pretty sure it's cause they were high as well, I saw them hitting their pens now and then( I never saw them exhale the smoke though lol) But anyways at this point even my brother from two seats away has noticed and he tells  me to tell them to quiet down. Well shit, at this point I knew I had to say something, but I was getting so damn anxious. I sat there for a while thinking of how to say it, at what level of volume, with what tone, and alternate scenarios where they just ignored  me or got angered. I was like Doctor Strange sifting through every single possibility where this shit goes south. Anyways knew I had to say something ya know, cause the poor girl sitting directly next to them wasn't saying shit. So finally as my heart rate is fucking jumping, my thoughts are going rapid fire and my anxiety is at the fucking peak of the mountain. I reach over and say ""Can you guys keep it down"", in a very serious voice. The guy looks over at me and kinda just goes "" yeah"". And for the rest of the movie they do just that. Yeah, that stupid little confrontation took a shit ton out of me, and the funniest thing was I felt so proud after lmao. My heart was literally racing after. If I'm being honest I think I startled them more than I was because they were so high they must have had no idea they were being so loud. Anyways needless to say that was a terrible movie experience cause somebody left the door to the entrance open and you could hear the line of people outside waiting to buy snacks. Also halfway through some little kids walked in and started yelling in their high pitched voices ""OMG MOM ITS SPIDERMAN CAN WE WATCH IT????? I WANT TO WATCH IT!!!!""

So that's what I tried to do. Every day for years, I would struggle to mask my social anxiety. I couldn't shake, I had to remain in eye contact, I couldn't avoid people. And it never worked.  n   nHaving social anxiety and being self-conscious of having social anxiety only made it worse. My inner voice had become so negative towards myself. Whereas your inner voice should be a soothing oneness with your being, my inner voice had become my enemy. I was overly critical of everything I did and thought.  nnnAnd then the pandemic happened, and I got to spend time alone. I think that's the best thing that ever happened to me. I had so much self-discovery, and I was allowed the graciousness of being able to choose when and how I wanted to interact with others.   nnnI also had time to reflect on my life and my goals and what I wanted to do, and I went for it. All the while still having social anxiety and terrified of other people. I did things that I never thought I would be able to do. I volunteered on my own, got multiple jobs by myself. (And I'm going to add this in because I'm proud of it), I even got an on-the-spot hire because my interview was that good. I also started going outside, wearing the clothes that I wanted ( I dress alt), learning how to drive, getting my license, shopping in stores, and my proudest achievement started going to the gym. Everything that I always wanted to do but always thought I couldn't do because I had social anxiety.   nnnI never defeated social anxiety. I'm definitely going to need therapy if I ever want to do that. But I think the best thing that ever happened to me was deciding, "" yeah, I have social anxiety, but this is what I want to do, so I'm going to do it even if I'm not perfect at it.""  n   nWorrying about having social anxiety did nothing but hold me back------now, I'm not saying don't worry about having social anxiety. The point in trying to make here is to give yourself graciousness and love. Even if you feel completely alone, let your inner voice give you the acceptance that we need as human beings.  nnnYes, I'm still socially anxious and overly conscious of myself, but my inner voice is so much more kind towards me.   n\---  nI haven't read this subreddit for a long time, but only after reading it have, I realized how far I've come from where I used to be. I never overcame social anxiety. Social anxiety was never the thing holding me back.   nnnExtra - some of my current beliefs on SA that are liable to change  nnn1. There is no need to try to mask the symptoms of having SA. I think acceptance can bring down the overall shame and frustration that is felt when you believe that you unsuccessfully hid your SA.

I'm just curious as to whether anybody else experiences this. It would be a big deal to me to know that it is a symptom of SA, as opposed to something else. nn**Every** (seriously) social situation outside of interaction with close friends/close family (in isolation, without anybody else around) leads to overthinking. Overthinking to me is thinking through every sentence I will say (and how I will say it) and every sentence/action they will respond with (regardless of the fact that it doesn’t work like that!). Overthinking to me is also trying to perfect my outer image, worrying about how I am walking, where I am looking, worrying about my facial expressions and the impression they give off, and so on. To give an example of overthinking, it is getting on the bus and worrying about how I am walking up the aisle, worrying about how others will perceive my seating position choice, worrying about where I am looking while walking up the bus aisle, and worrying about the speed at which I am doing it. Of course, these thoughts can not all exist at once, but they are all thoughts that have stressed me out to varying degrees while getting the bus to and from home every day. The average person, I am sure, does not concentrate on all these factors. Another example is going to the corner shop, where do I look while the cashier is scanning the items? I can’t answer that question and so it makes me more and more uncomfortable and mechanical as I fret about looking weird.  The worst thing is I don’t know how to stop it. nnThere is not a case where, in public, I am not focusing on my outer presentation and my actions. I want to stop overthinking: it makes me, and my actions, mechanical and unnatural, it makes me trip over my words, and it induces anxiety by making me worry that I look out of place or weird. One final example, this time I will just explain my thought process while the cashier is scanning items: “**Where do I look? Should I stare blankly into space? No, that’s weird. I’ll stare at the display instead. That’s weird but its better than staring into space, I guess. Where do I put my hands? Do I put them in my pocket? If I put them in my pocket, it might look like I have stolen something! Do I put them on the counter? I could put them on the counter but that looks too confident. It would seem out of place because I don’t think of myself as confident and others don’t think of me as confident, so I can’t do that! Should I pretend to check my phone? Yes, I will pretend to check my phone.”.** nnRationalising does not seem to have much effect. Telling myself that the cashier doesn’t care, even if I do look weird, or that the people on the bus are too busy focusing on themselves to care how I’m getting on the bus does not work to any great extent. It does not calm down the anxiety-inducing overthinking.nnThe overthinking also causes avoidance: I avoid going to events because I either (A.) overthink the event/situation beforehand and conclude, probably wrongly, that it will be a disaster and I shouldn’t go lest I make a fool out of myself or (B.) I avoid going to the event because I worry my overthinking will kick in and I’ll look out of place/mechanical.nnThank you very much if you read it",1

I just finished university and my anxiety was stable but since finishing it’s got worse all of a sudden. I have tried medication before but truthfully you just get given anti depressants for anxiety and they are kinda useless for anxiety I’ve found. nnDoes anyone have experience with using CBD oil for anxiety?

Either way it’s created a trauma with people that I’m working on everyday and slowly improving. nnI just wanted to know if anyone has personal experience with CBD oil for anxiety as I find the meds so shit. And am hoping the CBD is what I might need to give me that initial push along with my therapy etc. My parents are skeptical because of the ‘lack of research’ and my drug past but how do you guys feel about it? It doesn’t get you high and doesn’t get you addicted so I don’t see any issues with trying it out. nnI just want to know if it actually works and if it’s helped people as I’m desperately looking for something that actually might help my symptoms as truth be told I need a little aid right now to get me going. And overtime I’ll come off it. nnThanks guys x",1
6150,"slimmerspinker","post","I'm 24 and have only recently accepted the fact that I have untreated social anxiety. I feel like I'm losing control of my life and don't know how to reverse things. [Long vent you probably should't read]","Looking back, the symptoms were clear when I was in high school, but I didn't even know social anxiety was a thing back then. I would almost never speak to any of my classmates. I basically had no friends. There was a small group of kids that would often try to include me in outings, but I had this paranoid fear that they didn't really like me and just felt sorry for me, so I'd usually blow them off. On the occasions I did do things with them, I would find it totally overwhelming and when I got back home I would just focus on every 'mishap' I made. These mishaps were totally bizarre things; I remember one time I obsessed over accepting food from one of my friend's moms when no one else did. For weeks I'd wallow in anger with myself and ignore subsequent attempts by these ""friends"" to contact me. My sophomore year of high school, I dropped out of the public high school and homeschooled myself, largely because I couldn't deal with being in school for 8 hours a day. Academics weren't the issue: I was actually ranked 5 in my class at the end of freshman year, a distinction I didn't think twice about throwing away. Midway through that school year I stopped seeing anyone and would just stay in my house all day. I'd occupy myself with painting and playing music and feel very content. nnOut of pure circumstance I got a girlfriend the end of my sophomore year. It was 100% arranged by my sister, who was her friend. The girl needed a prom date and my sister gave her my number. For some reason, the two of us immediately hit it off. I think this helped me seem normal in other people's eyes and in my own, but in truth I never would have dated anybody had the opportunity not just been handed to me. nnWe dated for a year and a half. It was the first and really only time I've been emotionally intimate with anybody. It also helped bring me out of my shell a bit. Unfortunately as the relationship progressed she became emotionally and physically abusive.  I broke up with her and returned to my cocoon. Things went very downhill for a while. I'd rarely leave the house. I ate very little and never worked out, so got very skinny. I stopped getting regular haircuts. Most of my clothes didn't fit. I spent hours at a time locked in my room either listening to music or making my own. I would absorb myself so fully in private musical projects that it rarely occurred to me how lacking my social life was. Despite wasting my senior year of high school in isolation, I felt very ""happy"" at the time. I continued ignoring attempts by my classmates to reach out to me.   nnnCollege was much the same but worse. My first two years I made no friends, didn't go to a single party or gathering. My self-consciousness reached astronomical heights. I obsessed over my appearance; sitting in class ranged from uncomfortable to painful because people could see me. I ate alone every day. At a time in my life when I should have been making friends, dating, and enjoying myself, I was instead wandering off campus to a graveyard and playing harmonica to myself.   nnnJunior and senior year of college were slightly better. I started taking care of myself, working out and figuring out how to dress. The self-consciousness subsided a little bit. Junior year I made a small handful of friends (again, through no effort of my own), though I continued keeping my distance from them. Senior year I got another girlfriend, but she took 100% of the initiative. As before, it was an opportunity dropped in my lap. We weren't even that compatible and had little in common, so I eventually broke up with her. As was the case in high school, this relationship helped me deny that I had any problems socially.   nnnSince finishing college and starting my career, I feel like I have a split personality: there's the ""work"" me and the me that goes home. In a professional setting, my people skills are quite good. Everyone likes me at work. I can take charge. I can be witty. I know how to comfort people who are having a rough time. None of these abilities are translating to my personal life. As soon as I get home, I feel like a different person. I disengage. Weekends are spent in isolation. I have not made any friends or dated since graduating college. I've lost contact with my college friends after ignoring their repeated attempts to see me. I similarly ignore offers by my coworkers to hang out.   nnnBecause I'm lonely, I've spent a massive amount of time the past two years on dating apps: Tinder, Bumble, and now, Hinge. No dates despite this. Often I won't bother messaging matches, or will ignore their messages because I'm afraid of saying the wrong thing. On three or so occasions I've matched with girls with whom I've really hit it off; girls that were funny, pretty, had the same interests as me. Each time I've ghosted once things started moving towards an actual date, even though that's the thing I want.   nnnLast night I did it again. Matched with this really pretty girl who is into the same music as me, lives nearby, educated. She asked me out in her first message - asked if I wanted to go to a party with her last night. I straight up ignored her because the prospect of a party was too fucking scary for me.   nnnI'm so sick of myself. I know I'm wasting my life and I don't know how to change things.",0

Any help provided will be taken with extreme seriousness and gratitude. This issue has gotten to a point of desperation and being depression-inducing, so anything will do. nnI am a young --and not to toot my own horn-- well put together man. I am in great physical shape, I am sober, am very well educated (*phi beta kappa* at graduation), have a good/high-social-status job, and am applying to Ph.D. programs --and given my applications, it's highly likely I will get into a top tier one.   nnnI have a problem though. This is my inability to go out of my way to meet others. I almost have an invisible wall that pops up whenever this desire arises. I have heard Steven Pressfield in *The War of Art* call this ""resistance"".  I don't have resistance to work, healthy habits and even social interactions \[once I'm already in them\]. Rather, I have resistance to meeting new people and when I have romantic feelings for another person, telling them that I have such feelings --yes, even when it is obvious that the other person feels the same way. nnThis has left me as someone with very very little friends, a virgin, someone who cannot establish the full breadth of his current relationships and cannot attain new relationships. Such a status, when thought about for too long, gets me extremely depressed (psychomotor slowing, intrusive thoughts, wanting to isolate myself, etc). nnI can see how this resistance has built up. I have experience growing up in  a psychologically/emotionally (sometimes physically, but lesser so) abusive household, my experience with my adolescent friend group entailed frat-adjacent abuse, I have witnessed the abduction/sexual abuse of good friends at a young age, and have --on the only occasion that I was almost in a relationship-- experience with narcissistic abusive partners. In turn, at least from a psychoanalytic perspective, I understand that these experiences can compile into such anxiety. nnI have gone to three therapists. I have never taken medication. We've done CBT and talk therapy. It hasn't been doing much for me. When told to do exposure therapy, I am basically told to go out and have conversations with people but *resistance* prevents that from happening. I do meditate, exercise frequently and do yoga, which helps ward off intrusive thoughts and the stress associated with this. I have written about my past in *great* depth, so it's not as if there is any stone unturned in that regard. nnI met on my own one person at college. I somehow mustered up the strength one day to break through my resistance and meet one person, and that led to a cascade of meeting generally great people and a lot of them.nnIn this situation, my anxiety was little to none. I was capable of forming good friendships in this setting.  nnThe kicker with this is that all of the people I got close with went away for graduate school, and now I am left with one person. This person (who you can read about in the linked [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dks6w2/complicated_situation_need_help/)) is the closest I've ever been to another person. It's honestly beautiful. I have romantic feelings for her (and I suspect with great evidence that the feeling is mutual), but, she's in a relationship, hence, my resistance to telling her how I feel is ***immense***. nnMy goal here is to gain the capability to meet others *on my own* and in person and to be able to tell those I love *exactly* how I feel about them. I've tried [meetup.com](https://meetup.com), but I can't introduce myself to people in groups (I am horrible in group settings because I am an introvert personality-wise). Otherwise, I won't have a great life. If I let things continue this way I will be alone both friendship wise and romantic partner wise. nnWhen I am told to go out and meet people, I try but the resistance is horrible and it never works (I can only introduce myself to other via impulse, one which is extraordinarily rare to actually generate action). In the whenever in my life, I have planned on telling someone how I feel about them romantically, I couldn't because at the moment of telling them the anxiety gets so bad that I cannot say anything.  nnWould (non-benzo) medication be worth pursuing? Any other forms of therapy that might help with this situation.   nnnThank you all. I *will* beat resistance. I might just need a little help in doing so. :)",1

I would constantly be told I was over the top, too loud, too distracting, ugly for it, etc. I used to have dreams/goals and I used to pursue them because I was so happy! But by the time I was in middle school I got super depressed from the ""you're so annoying"" shit. I stopped being class clown, I gained 50 lbs, I dropped out of all activities, I lost all my friends, and I tried to kill myself by the time I was 18.nnI am now 25, write comedy for a living, and recently started to feel like my happy self. I started doing contract work instead of a full 9-5, and make enough to get by this way. It works better for my OCD and my depression, as well as my anxiety, which got really bad when I worked in an office. As a result, I have been ""myself"" for the first time in probably the better part of a decade.nnThe only issue is, my friends are angry. They got to know this depressed version of me-- quiet, agreeable, nonthreatening, career-less, low and humble. Now I have confidence, and they're annoyed. I guess I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't... but I recognize this withering. I immediately started calling myself ""idiot"" in my own head, started overeating out of stress, caring WAY too much about what they thought, which is my biggest folly. Just today I tried to tell my friend a joke and she said I was annoying and out of control, stop trying to be funny, etc. I felt the spiral to shrink away. I realize this is all or nothing behavior, but the issue is... I don't think being happy or jokey is the worst thing you can be, and it is truly, deeply who I am.nnBut the thing is, I am not trying to be annoying. I am just happy for the first time since they've ever known me. I think they became friends with my depression, not me, and they don't like me this way. Issue being, when I was depressed all they did was call me a drag for being depressed.nnI don't want to lose all my relationships, but it hurts, even at 25 and an adult, to get called annoying. They even stopped talking to me in a group chat and started a new one without me. I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to fall from grace, emotionally. I am truly happy and non-suicidal for the first time in years, and I am having healthier thoughts too! nnFor instance today when I found out they made another chat without me, I sat and thought hard about my behavior. Why don't they specify what exactly I did wrong? Then there is nothing I can do. I can't sit here playing guessing games for hours a day, then curl up in bed and cry why does everyone hate me. My friends also started ignoring my texts now that I am 'happy.' So, I looked for council from third parties (therapist, sister, other friends) and showed them my jokey way of acting/speaking, they said I was seriously not doing anything wrong, it's not like I was making personal attacks, and these people are going to hate what I do no matter what.nn**But the perfectionist in me is mad at myself,** I have the urge to restrain and whittle myself down. But I don't want to. I made this mistake before and it cost me nearly two decades, and the most formative ones, of my life. I want to be my silly happy self. I am in love with myself for the first time in my life, I am me again!! If my friends hate my confidence, if they can't share in my giddiness, and if they can't be direct and say what exactly is annoying them, then I choose myself. But it's easier said than done.

6168,"FlexingDee","post","Anxiety has dictated my life","I've had anxiety since I was 9 years old. I remember being scared of going to restaurants, they'd make me feel ill. This then progressed to not wanting to go to my friend's parties because I didn't like to eat in front of people. Then it turned into avoiding social situations altogether. Now, even going into a supermarket makes me anxious.nnWhen I was at university, not wanting to socialise didn't concern me much. I saw myself as an introvert. I didn't want social connections. A friend = more chance of them wanting to hang out with me = anxiety. I was particularly anxious at parties and social gatherings so unless I met them whilst working (one friend I did), I wouldn't been friends with them.nnI'm now 23 (male), and I'm still seeing my anxiety dictate my life. I currently work from home and often won't leave the house unless it's to do food shopping. I have a group of friends I keep in contact with over message, yet I'm too anxious to ever meet up. A lot of these friends are moving on in their lives, which I don't blame them for, considering our friendship never built up to it's potential because of my anxiety. The main people I talk to are my parents that I live with. This presents it's own issues as I don't feel I've ever found my identity. My brother and sister either formed long-term relationships or went travelling around the world at my age. Often your sense of being is built through experiences with friends of similar ages or trips you've been on. I feel I can't relate to my generation, as I have the mindset of an older person, considering my parents are not only my parents, but also my main social group. I have a cynical view on the world, generated by the shame I have for having IBS, which causes anxiety like a cycle. At school I was teased for having it, so now everyone I meet I think will laugh at me. I almost don't want to get to know people, because I don't want them to hurt me.nnI don't have many hobbies or interests, other than my job. I do solo activities like reading/jogging/podcasts. However, I don't find myself 'enjoying' them anymore, it's more something I do because I'm bored. I used to be quite passionate about my job, it's something I loved doing since I was a kid. If little me could see myself career wise he'd be ecstatic. 'You get to work on that?! Wow!!!!!!'. Yet if he saw my life outside of work, he'd be sad. Most days, I'll just surf the internet or reflect on how my anxiety is dictating my life, whilst seeing friends finding love, going partying or fulfilled in their interests.nnI've tried to address the anxiety, at the end of my school years I went to CBT sessions. Unfortunately the therapist wasn't for me. When I attended university, I decided to go privately to a councillor who I'm still seeing once a month after 2 years. I think they've helped quite a bit. I went from staying at the change-over station trying to find the courage to get on the next train, to picking up a hospitality job whilst at university. My motivation to succeed career-wise sometimes shifts my anxiety aside yet I find it very difficult to do the same in my social life. I thought exposure-therapy might help, yet I already had evidence of it not working i.e. I was still very anxious commuting to university even after doing it 3 times a week for 3 years. I think the anxiety probably reduced by 25%, but then plateaued. If there was any change in the situation, i.e. I go on the train with a friend rather than on my own, the anxiety then goes back up as if I'd never tried to tackle it.nnWhilst I like my therapist, I think I want to move on and find a CBT person who can set me goals and work through problems together. A councillor can be great, however I thought action might be better than talking. I'm sceptical given the experience I had of my previous CBT therapist though. I feel like there's so many problems to address. If I was anxious in one particular environment, I could see how it might be fixed. Yet my anxiety progresses into all aspects of my life. I was 9 when it started, it's going on 14 years since I first felt irrational anxiety.nnHow do I address this? Do I force myself to go out more, and deal with the anxiety? Yet when I do, it only gets easier in that specific situation. Should I see a CBT therapist or is there another discipline that's better? What can they do that I haven't already?nnMy hope is that, by writing this, someone might relate and see there's someone else like them. Or provide advice on what to do. Thanks all.",1

I managed to make it into a decent one after getting some decent grades. I never got to take of a gap year because I couldn't convince my mum to let me take one (we don't have the best relationship) now I'm into this Economics course that I don't even really like and for the life of me I can't motivate myself to do work. nnDuring the induction and all that crap I skipped everything, didn't go to any of the festivals or events, Just some online stuff and the mandatory lectures, That was at the start of the term, recently I've been sort of missing my lectures, possibly cause of anxiety idk. nnAs I've writing this I've got a little under 2 weeks before my two term 1 exams. Which are going to be full of content from the 1st semester that I half-assed, and when I tell you I have not sat down for single proper revision session in three months I'm not lying. I keep telling myself I'll start later today as I'm procrastinating (Reddit, Twitch, Youtube) but now I've been saying this to myself since before the new year lol. It's one thing to look at the date and say, yh I've got 14 days, if I organise myself I can revise decently, or I could ask the university whether I'm eligible for a deferall. But when it's 13:00 and you've got like 9 hours on the clock, You realise how unmotivated you are. nnThis isn't my first time cramming, or doing some assignment last minute. Just before Christmas I had an 1500 word essay that I didn't do, got 2 extensions for (15 working days) and still only finished it like 5 hours before the deadline. I actually got a good grade for it aswell!nnI don't know whether Im depressed or what but I can't do work man. Fuck work, I should of deferred the course and had year of to sort this social anxiety shit out, but guess what, I'm literally in the course and there's nothing I can do now, so thinking that is kind of depressing. Big regret of mine.nnI finally decided that I'm just kind of fucked up rn so I talked to the GP where my university is and got prescribed Zoloft. The pharmacy is only open on working days so during this weekend I wasn't able to confirm anything. But if this prescription goes through I'm not sure whether to start taking it immediately. I don't even know the mg of the prescription yet gonna find out tomorrow on Monday, and I can't believe the doctor wouldn't tell me that. Kind of bad practice but whatever I need the meds. The side affects of zoloft are what I'm scared of because though I'm sort of unmotivated and degen rn, if I take these meds and side affects come up surely I will just become an even worse version of myself. I can't imagine that. But without the meds as you can see I'm not doing shit.nnLife sucks and online is better. I'm done with this shit.",1

My social anxiety has never been diagnosed but I know it is severe. I am absolutely terrified to leave home and enter into situations where I am in the spotlight. The major obstacle in front of me right now is finding a part-time job. I have not worked since I was a teenager. I went to college when I graduated high school and saw that as a way to satisfy my parents and let me focus on academics. I've always loved school, I like to focus my energy assignments and always did my best on papers and other work. College gave me goals and a purpose.nnThis summer, a tragedy struck my family that I am still recuperating from and may never be able to move past. I am doing better, but it played a role in my decision not to attend college this fall. I also didn't go due to transportation issues (I don't drive and don't own a car) and my depression and anxiety which rose to new highs after what happened. My family often fights, yells and breaks things and I hate it. I can't deal with conflict. I don't feel safe at home.nnI have no friends to turn to, and my immediate family has never discussed emotions or mental health. In this family, you are expected to work if you have limbs and are not bedridden or disabled, mental illness might as well not exist. They think I am perfectly fine and so I am being harassed and verbally abused nearly every day. I am not good at confrontations and so I choose to stay in my room and hope nothing happens. They have no idea of the mental turmoil I am going through each and every waking moment of my life. nnI can't handle the stress of being insulted and put down at every moment. The very people who are supposed to love and  care for me treat me like utter garbage and half the time I actually believe they'd be better off without me. I wake up every day for the family members that have shown they love me and care about me, no matter my shortcomings or the fact that I'm jobless and not in school. My narcissistic father is the main abuser, and my mother enables it. They have shown time and time again that their love is conditional on worshiping them and doing everything they command like I'm some dog.nnI have reached my breaking point. I don't know how I can continue. I can't keep living each day knowing my family hates me and that the world will reject me. I am terrified to the point of wanting to vomit when I think about applying somewhere to work and, of course, the dreaded interview. I am trapped in my room and trapped in a world that does not want me in it. I am only 21, and I don't know how I will ever make it through another 40 years of working then 40 years of old age. nnHow am I ever supposed to succeed? I am too scared to even get a license and get to college. I am currently accomplishing nothing in life out of sheer fear. I just want someone to wake me up and get me back on track. I am stuck in a permanent existential crisis. Somebody, please help me get out of this abyss.",0

I’m learning to celebrate the little victories rather than focusing on the downside - being pleased I did a scary thing rather than being annoyed at myself for being scared in the first place. Last week I managed to call my doctor’s office to fix things after they messed up my appointment date/time, and I didn’t even spend hours afterwards convincing myself I’d sounded like a complete idiot (maybe ten or twenty minutes, but a few months ago I’d still be cringing over it now, a week later). Today I made another phone call for another appointment.nnI’m starting to realise that for me, the worst part of the anxiety is in the run-up to doing the thing (e.g. staring at my phone working up the courage to press “dial”), so if I just take the plunge and do it quickly, there’s far less time spent on the worst part. Do I still pray that they won’t pick up the phone and panic when they do? Sure. But I’m still proud when it’s over.nnLast week I even went to a party and chatted to people I didn’t know and we had a good laugh. Again, the next day I convinced myself I’d embarrassed myself completely, but I still did it, and that’s what matters - especially considering before these recent months I’d gone from being socially anxious to all-out agoraphobic, only leaving the house once a month for doctor appointments. Even better, I got invited to another party by the same person next month - so it’s more proof to me that my anxiety is a liar, because if I’d been so annoying they wouldn’t have invited me to the next one. nnIt’s nice to finally be feeling more hope and pride than fear and despair.

I'm almost quitting college for the second time cause i'm afraid of bad grades making people think i'm not as smart as i look, i look for jobs only once every two years cause i'm afraid of not getting one and being called an incompetent person by my parents, i don't look for dates cause i'm extremely afraid getting rejected will make other people think i'm undesirable and unlovable. I don't do things that could end my loneliness cause i'm afraid failure to  to prove everyone i'm the greatest will only further this grief.nnMy therapist will not give sessions for a month, so i ask you guys if any of you has gone through a simillar situation in life and if you can share some strategy with me to at least lower the effects of this lingering mindset.",1

When is it going to get better? Does it ever get better anyway? I can't shake off this feeling...I dont know what my life is and I dont know what else to do, Am I doing something wrong? Am I not good enough? I've tried fixing up my routine and my diet and working out but nothing excites me, hanging out makes me depressed, my country makes me depressed, everything depresses me... I mean I know I would love to become a millionaire, be financially free and move out to a different country, fix my disgusting appearance, but how am I supposed to achieve all of that when I'm in constant pain everyday? I'm just so sick of this void, emptiness, feeling shitty no matter what I do.  Even small tasks like eating or taking a shower are so terribly hard... I'm so pathetic, I'll never amount to anything with this feeling.nn I want to end my life but I'm such a coward... I might end up homeless if I continue living cause that's where my depression is leading me to... Its like I'm in limbo, I'm trapped, and I don't know how much I can keep on pushing. I'm desperately crying as I write this, so frustrated about my life... I wish I could find a gun as easy as people do in other countries so I can just put an end to this suffering.  I'm a burden to my family, and it's impossible to talk about this to them (I've tried and they just simply dont know what to do) and I have already tried a bunch of different therapists and  meds, and nothing seem to work.

I work in a grocery store and everyone there keeps their distance from me. The ones who do talk to me treat me like a child. I'm not only extremely socially anxious, but I'm awkward, and I can't get thoughts out without my mind going blank. Around middle school is when I became a major recluse. Before that, I was a social kid and I had a lot of friends, but my father became addicted to drugs and alcohol, and my mom moved out, so I was stuck caring for him. I was afraid he was going to die, so I would never leave the house, I would just play video games all the time. There were multiple times I came home to my dad on the brink of death from overdosing. He even threatened suicide in front of me and my brother while we were crying. Anyways, I spent like 6 years inside, playing my computer. When I wasn't playing games I'd be at school, and I never talked to ANYONE except for very few. There were a couple instances where I was kind of bullied but most people just felt sorry for me and left me alone. I was so depressed that I stopped enjoying even talking to the few people I had. So I'd just stay to myself, daydreaming, thinking about my computer games. I didn't enjoy socializing with anyone. I put on a facade every time and I almost felt completely depersonalized. I still feel that way today. To make it worse, recently I screwed up my chances of getting with a girl who very much wanted me. We met at work and only messaged each other over Snapchat. After a few months of her nagging me to hang out, I finally built of the courage to, and when I did, I completely blew it. I was an awkward mess and kept apologizing. But the whole time I didn't even enjoy being next to her. I liked her so much but I didn't know how to operate. It's like I had a shroud over me keeping me from being myself and thinking clearly. Like my judgement was completely out the window. So she told me it was weird afterwards and stopped talking to me. I don't know what to do. Therapy has never helped. I just pretend to absorb what the therapist is saying but I never do. My dad passed away a year ago and I moved in with my mom like 5 years ago and at 21 I still have no idea what I want to do with my life. I have no motivation or passions. What do I do at this point? Should I just go on a full blown ayahuasca trip and hope it somehow fixes my sperg brain? I'm so helpless. I just want to be liked. I just want friends. I want to fit in and find a girl.",1

(25M)","For as long as I can remember, no matter if it was bouncing chairs, rocking chairs, being rocked back and forth, swinging on a swing, or even taking an elevator in a building, any sort of bouncing, rocking, motion-related things would make me feel nauseous and sick. I was told that as a baby, when I was bouncing in a chair or being rocked back and forth, I would cry - so that was stopped quickly. For all my life, I’ve felt wobbling and rocking sensations (like I’m on a boat) even while sitting still. Putting myself in motion then coming to a stop can magnify that sensation.nnLater on into childhood, I was doing a lot of skating at hockey rinks and playing hockey. There was one time, when I was around maybe 10-12 years old, I was skating around the rink and all of a sudden got this super numb feeling from head to toe, almost a light-headed feeling, where everything around me felt ‘off’. I rushed off the rink super fast as I felt nervous and it took me several minutes of sitting down in a seat and relaxing until it went away. It’s hard to explain the exact feeling. But it’s just like my brain, body, and surroundings felt off. Moving my arms and body just didn’t feel normal. Even though I loved skating and hockey more than anything, I basically had to be forced to go back and start skating again, as I was too afraid that it would happen again.nnI did get back into skating and hockey, and several years later, when I was probably around 16, I was in a hockey tournament and it happened once again but this time it was while playing on the rink. Body went completely numb, surroundings felt weird, it felt weird to move my body. Immediately, I took myself off the rink while the game was in play, and people looked at me questioning what I was doing. It was all confusing for me too, as I simply did not understand what was happening or why it was happening again.nnThis feeling I got while playing hockey or skating ultimately led me to quitting the sport I love.nnNow today, I’m in my mid-20’s, and about a year and a half ago, I started taking a protein bar out with me while in public because there were certain points where I figured my blood sugar maybe just dipped a bit low (felt a tiny bit nervous), I would eat the snack and felt better a few minutes later. Then, at the time, I was taking protonix/pantoprazole (which I took for over 7+ months due to an ulcer), and then came off an antibiotic and steroid (at the end of the protonix) from being sick. I was out in public about exactly a year ago, after finishing those medications, and after eating a big meal, I went into a department store and had a full-blown panic attack for the first time. Now, I’m dealing anxiety and difficultly leaving the house (a bit agoraphobic) since having 2 panic attacks in public.nnAs I look back on different situations in my life where I got anxious, nervous, and/or got this ‘numb-type feeling’ that overtook my body and my surroundings felt off, it was typically while skating, playing hockey, driving in a vehicle, being around a large crowd of people like in a sports arena, or anxiousness led to it and it took a little while to relax and for the sensation to go away. This ‘off-feeling’ still happens here and there (not nearly as prominent as before), but mixed with the current state of anxiousness and difficulty being able to leave the house.nnI am not asking for diagnoses, but just want to know if anyone has ideas of what this could potentially be, as well as any feedback or tips. I recently read some research on the vestibular system and its relation to anxiety, agoraphobia, balance and motion, and makes me wonder if there is something potentially wrong with that.nnThank you for reading this!",0

I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with social anxiety and had to go to counseling. I stopped going after a few times because all it did was make me feel worse. nnToday I went back to the doctor since my anxiety hasn't improved much. Sometimes I feel like there's no point in getting help. Everytime I've gone to get help they tell me there's nothing wrong with me and it's just my personality.

I can't order at restaurants, talk on the phone or anything. nnI started University this fall and I thought I would make lots of new friends but I haven't made any at all.

6226,"Leon_monk","post","For everyone that is fighting with social Anxiety.","Hey, everyone, I love being in this group. Thanks for letting me in and getting to know everyone. I’m here for a little while now and I wanted to share my story with you, regarding my struggles with social anxiety. (and how things got a lot better)   nAs far as I can look back, I always dreaded groups of people. I could talk with people one on one when I knew them and the topic was in my interest, but how bigger the group the more I disappeared in the background and starting to feel lonely. I had some things  I was happy about but I had a problem, a HUGE problem and I didn’t know how to solve it.  nEven though It seemed like my life was doing well. I was terrible at Socializing with new people and started to go down the hill… I always thought things like:   n‘’Is there something wrong with me’’  n‘’Why is everybody having a good time and I’m standing here alone?’’   n‘’I’m not interesting’’  n‘’I want to participate but I don’t know what to say…’’   nSo many people and still I felt alone. Like did it even matter why I was here in the first place? No one seems to care about my presence. And the cluttering noise of all those voices, what if they just don’t like me and are just ignoring me, secretly hoping that I would leave on my own?   nI could not understand why I was not able to make a conversation with anyone. I could try to talk to someone I didn’t know but, I was too scared to do that, my heart rate would go up, my head turned red, Knees shaking and my hands wear sweating. I’m not giving someone a hand with that warm sticky hands… That would be weird right? DAMN, How Could I ever gain the confidence to talk to someone…  nAt work, it was no different, when I had a meeting with co-workers. My mind would race all the time but when I had to say something I would just stay quiet. I still remember the day that I got promoted around Christmas and my boss told me I should do a speech In front of everybody UNPREPARED. I didn’t want to do it but I couldn’t say No either. Most Awkard moment of my life… Almost panicking in front of my co-workers…   nThose were the struggles and thoughts I had almost every day. Of course, I tried to overcome my fear and starting to talk to someone. It felt so awkward... That conversation died really fast and made me feel like a total failure. My mind went blank and didn’t know what to say… I thought that I might be disturbing that person his privacy.   nFrustrated and confused I go home, I went on the internet to look for some guidance on how to talk to people/socializing. I got angry every time I saw those mainstream videos on youtube where the person in the video clearly hasn’t figured it out himself. ‘’Just be confident’’ or Just be yourself’’ they say. Like really F\*cking smart Einstein, Look where that ‘’Just be yourself’’ BS has brought me at this point. And even worse it looks like everyone else already has it figured out. No else seems to have this problem… I thought the only way to be cool and accepted by others, was to be someone else instead of embarrassing the person I really was. I already had tried some confidence/dating courses on the internet for a lot of money…A psychologist that gave me wrong diagnose, Therapists that didn’t understand me, Psychiatrists that gave meds like they where some candy, Stupid Apps that didn’t work and on social media I haven’t any success so far.   nAll I wanted was that someone came along to help me out of that jungle of frustration and confusion and help me to become the coolest person in the room. I wanted to be funny and interesting at the same time. I wanted to be that person that people like to hang out with. I wanted to become more outgoing and easily make friends. I wanted to lose the fear of getting judged and self-doubt. I didn’t want to care anymore what people thought about me.  nNow after almost 5 years of hustling hard getting myself out of my comfort zone and working hard on myself. I overcame my social anxiety, Have no trouble talking in front of a large group of people, I can engage in conversations with more people included than just 1, I can speak in an assertive way without starting to freak out. I am making a career and had several girlfriends that were beautiful and interesting that I never thought would be in my league. All I did was improving step by step my social skills.  nNow what I want to do is help people in their 20’s and 30’s with social anxiety, that can resonate with my story. And If you read until here, the chances are really high that you have been going through the same. Tell me about your experiences! I’m really curious to hear about it! in the comments or just send me a Private Message!",1

But the thing is regular people don’t understand social anxiety in society and give you disgusted looks if ur ‘shy’ or can’t hold a conversation or are god forbid ‘awkward’ nnSo suffering quite bad with social anxiety for the last 3 years a few days ago I finally decided I can’t be arsed being ‘nice too people’ as the reality is people with social anxiety are so nice and just don’t want to offend others and people just look down at them and give you this look of like ‘what the fuck is wrong with you’ I can’t be only me who’s got this look. nnSo a few days ago I said fuck this shit and I just decided no more mr nice guy and I’m gonna play the, fake confident dickhead character as I’m getting dodgy stares either way so why not. People say I’m quite an intimidating looking guy, I wear a lot of stone island and Jewellery and caps, but the reality is I’m a really nice guy and having social anxiety in a bad way, but when people see me they expect me to be a cocky dickhead chav. nnI think the fact that I’m normally awkward in interactions with strangers is weird to people because of how I look. But they still look at me like I have issues and whenever I walk in somewhere all heads turn to look at me.. (no I’m not imagining it, it’s just all the boomers look at people who wear stone island and jewels and judge them as some kinda scum. That’s just what they do) nnSo anyway I’m going off track. I decided if I’m anxious and people are gonnna look at me disgusted or when they speak to me clearly don’t like my presence that I may aswell rock the character. So I was in this crowded place that would normally make me feel really anxious. And I just played the fake confident character and didn’t speak really quietly and introverted like I normally do. nnI spoke with quite a loud voice and wasn’t like trying to be too nice to people so they don’t think badly of me like I normally do. I just faked acting confident and tried to look like I didn’t give a shit what anyone thought of me. I’m 23 and everyone else in the shop were 50+ boomers who were judging the way I dress 100%. nnBut Yeha what I’m trying to come to. Is that the  acting cocky and overly confident peronality worked! Like it really worked. People were staring I acted like I didn’t give a fuck and the anxiety went! This is the dilemma I’m coming to is I felt way better within myself acting this way. As this was naturally my personality beofre ku diagnosis. I was never a dickhead. I just mean I used to be really confident and when people look at me I think this is kinda how they assume I would be peronality wise. So if I am it’s like they kinda don’t think there’s something wrong with me and it seems more normal. nnIs it weird that acting this way made me feel way less anxious and conscious about what others were thinking of me in the moment? And going forward shall I carry on doing this and not worry so much about being overly nice to people. As being anxious and trying to be nice clearly doesn’t work as u just get looked down upon for being anxious. nnSorry about the rant and sorry if some stuff I wrote doesn’t make any sense. It was rushed. But I thought this was deffo an intresting one to bring up! As it seems like cocky fake confidence kinda works! nnLemme know what u guys think! Big love to the social anxiety community!! Btw I’ve attached a link for the kinda look that people associate me with and think I look like so that u can tell why boomers and older people might think I’m some kinda cunt without even knowing me. But I’m more then willing to take that cunt label if it makes me feel more confident within myself.

6233,"9875342901","post","Should I tell my parents I feel like they hate me?","Hello! I am 20 years old and have dealt with depression and anxiety my whole life. My parents are aware of my mental health issues and have always been extremely supportive, I started going to therapy at around 12 or 13. All through middle and high school, I was very moody/reclusive around my family and they used to joke about it all the time and sometimes still bring up mean things I said because they see it as funny angsty teenager stuff. It really hurts me when they say it though and even though I've told them that they don't stop. My mom once told me she was disappointed in our relationship and thought when she had a daughter she would be closer to her like she is with her mom. All through high school, I was so aware that I was acting rude/cold towards them, but I couldn't seem to change it even when I tried. When they asked why I was always mad/stayed in my room all day and never talked to them/never opened up about my feelings I just said I was tired because I didn't know what was going on. nnAs I've said I've been seeing a therapist for a while, I've seen two therapists and three psychiatrists. In high school and middle school all they would ever say is that it is really normal for teenagers to be depressed/stressed and that I would probably grow out of it. A few months ago I saw a new psychiatrist and she told me she thinks I have social anxiety. After she said this I felt like I finally could understand where all my mental health symptoms have been coming from and one of the things I realized is that my attitude towards my parents has been shaped by my underlying belief that they hate me. I feel so stupid that I didn't understand this is what was going on for so long, but it's so hard to know which feelings are normal and which ones are not so I guess I just though panic/fear was a normal feeling towards interacting with your family.nnOk finally my question, sorry for all the rambling. Do you guys think it will be helpful if I explain to my parents I feel like they hate me and so I'm afraid of them and that's why I act like I do? I want to get it off my chest, but if all its going to do is make them feel like failures as parents and make them feel awkward around me then I don't want to. Also, it just feels dumb to say because I know they love me, but I can't help but feel like they hate me and I always overthink everything I say to them. nnThank you so much to anyone who read all that and I appreciate so much your advice! &lt;3",1

The thoughts that come to your mind are a result of many different background unconcious processes which you do not have much control of. These thoughts that you have are a result of your genetics as well as the experiences you've had over your life. If you're rejected you may automatically have the thought ""I'm such a piece of shit. There's something wrong with me"" and consequently feel extremely lowly. You don't exactly choose to have that thought and thus to castigate your ""concious self"" for thinking that way and thus feeling low is unfair to you. nnYou can change these automatic patterns of thought but it is highly difficult for any human being to do so. So don't be  too hard on yourself if you cop out of a social situation, feel extremely anxious and so forth. Instead accept this as human fallibility that you have little control of. What you do have control of is recognizing these dysunctional thoughts and emotions when they occur and then working on them. nnNote: This post will make more sense if you are familiar with cognitive behavioural therapy",0

More power to them. It's not my thing, but if that's what they want to do, far be it from me to judge them or stop them. I just don't want to go with them.

I have quite bad social anxiety (which luckily Ive been able to manage through therapy) and I think I have feelings towards a guy - I'm gay. I have been friends with this guy for about a year, known him a bit longer. I don't really know if he is gay, bi or something else or not but I assume that he is most likely straight. nnThe thing is that I have started to see signs that he maybe could have feelings for me too (at least if I believe my friends who have more experience with relationships than me - their opinion is that he is showing clear signs - I mostly think that he is suspiciously friendly or just being friendly). I have never dated so I don't know to look for the signs and I know that my social anxiety affects how I interpret things. In the past I have had very negative experiences with people sonce I was heavily bullied at school - thats why I have social anxiety disorder. All I see is patterns that deviate from his normal behavior. Usually he is very chill person. And what is also confusing is that he is not that touchy feely person - he is a bit introverted and analytical. nn- He asked me to have lunch with him - we've had lunch together couple timesn- He compliments me (IMO too much) n- I've noticed that even though we are two different persons with different backgrounds, we have kinda similar experiences and values. Almost eerily similar. n- Usually every time I ask him to, for example, to have coffee with me he says yes most of the time (usually says no if he is busy but when he has more free time, he usually says yes)n- He asked me to visit his apartment n- He has also visited my apartment n- We could talk for hoursn- He sent me ""Merry christmas"" message - which was new since I usually sent christmas wishes and people answer back to men- in new years eve he invited me to a new years event in his church to hang out with him and his friendsnnThe thing is that I haven't had the courage to speak about this since I'm worried how he would react and I appreciate his friendship a lot. I'm not that worried about rejection (since I can handle is clear situations more than grey areas). Yes it would sting but I could move on but if the situation isn't clear or becomes awkward it would be bad for my social anxiety.nnIs he being a friend or is there something more? nnThank you!",1

Most of the time is just lack of interest from both of us. But this friend is different. I've known her for 4 years somehow we're still friends. She's awesome. She cares a lot about me, makes me feel safe and comfy, even consider me one of her best friends, and she's the most lovely person I know.nn&amp;#x200B;nnFor the last two month I've been completely unable to talk to her. I want to, but I get scared. When I do talk to her, and she answers back, I panic and don't answer back. I feel that any thing I say to her could be the last. I feel that she's always about to dump me. Every word feels wrong, missplaced, and stupid. I've always felt like this to some extent, but nowhere near as much as now.nn&amp;#x200B;nnWhen I met her I tended to ask her (and my other friends at the time) why she was my friend. Why she chose me specifically. What there is about me that makes me worth keeping. Why waste your time with me, when you have many friends that are better. Of course, all of these questions are bullshit and un-answereable. You like your friends because you just do. I also asked her often what part of me she disliked, and made sure to let her know that if I said or did anything that upsets her, she should tell me. I still don't understand why she likes me. I don't get it. And I think I'm scared to talk to her because of that.

6287,"Dense-Sheepherder","post","I used to think that I was shy...","... but now I'm having second thoughts. I really hope it's okay for me to be making this post here. nnI'm 19 years old and has always been called shy. I've also been the ""awkward girl"", like when my friends laugh at how I'm sometimes looking down instead of making eye contact while ordering coffee, or the ""rude girl"" who answers people with yes/no answers and doesn't continue the conversation. nnRecently I've started to think if I may have social anxiety or something else going on. I have been thinking about getting help for it, maybe therapy or so, but at the same time my minds keeps telling me that I'm overreacting, that I'm just shy and that other people have it worse than me so I should just stop complaining. When is it time to get help? When does normal become ""not normal""?nnHere are a few things about me:nn* I have some level of anxiety almost every night and morning before work even though I've been working at the same job for 5 or 6 months. There have been incidents where I cried like a baby from anxiety and called in sick since i just can't handle it (It happened last night actually, I cried for hours because I was so anxious about work today and called in sick).n* My job is actually manageable for most of the time I'm there, but I have moments (and whole days) that make me feel so worthless and anxious. This is probably why I have pre-work anxiety all the time, I'm always fearing that it might be one of those bad days. Whenever other people are around me and can see me working, I kind of lose my ability to do the tasks correctly and almost become mute (I am still able to speak, but it feels almost impossible to do so and I struggle), because I feel like people are watching me and seeing all the mistakes I make thinking I'm terrible at what I'm doing.n* I can barely speak to groups (or pairs) of people I don't know well. Most of the time in these situations, such as parties, I'm almost unable to say a single word unless it's to my friends, and if I speak to someone I don't know well or at all, it will probably be in short sentences or ""yes/no""-answers and I will be uncomfortable the whole time. n* Having oral presentations and group discussions in school was a nightmare for me, even more so in my non-native languages. There were times where I came very prepared to a group discussion and still couldn't manage to say more than one single sentence (believe me, I suffered for those 6 seconds) when everyone around me were having long and advanced discussions. n* Even with my friends and family that I'm very comfortable with, I overanalyze everything. I have to think about not making too much or too little eye contact, how often and how often I blink etc, and I notice every single sign that someone might be annoyed or uncomfortable because of me. I basically become hyperaware of what I'm doing and saying, because I'm fearing that I'll make someone uncomfortable or do something weird. nnIn conclusion: At my job and in social situations, my brain reacts like I'm the center of the universe and everyone is looking at me and judging me, even though I know this is not the case. This has started to get in the way of my job (I couldn't get to work today because I was crying all night from pre-work anxiety. My anxiety is usually milder and almost invisible to other people, but it's also not the first time this happened).nnIs this just normal shyness and a part of who I am, or should I get help?? I'm kinda lost.",0

No dates, no lunch meetings, no going over to my friends house, no nothing involving food. Any advice from someone who has gone through something similar? Here is my story told as breifly as possible:nnWhen I was 14 or 15 (I forget), I went through several traumatic experiences that left me with ptsd (admittedly, self diagnosed. Could be something else.). One of them was my beast friend dying, the others I would rather not mention. Well, for some reason it started making me have extreme anxiety when trying to eat in front of other people. It got worse and worse. Pretty soon, I was gagging and throwing up at the thought of even trying. Like, if a friend invited me over for lunch, I would start shaking  uncontrolably, feel the blood rush into my head and I would throw up right then and there. Then, I would go and throw up again at his house while trying to eat lunch (this was before I started turning every invitation down). This would obviously lead to some excruciatingly awkward moments, which in turn would double my anxiety. It got over the top. 24/7 all I would think about was the possibility that I would have to eat in front of people and embarrass myself. Now I just turn everything involving food down. I can't go out to dinner with my family, I can't eat at my friends houses, I can't anything. I will literally just throw up.nnSomething weird, if this makes a difference, is that in some situations I can eat my own crappy food in front of people, but not their, better-tasting, food. I am weird.nnEveryone that I told about this would just tell me to man up and i'll get over it. What an unhelpful response. I've tried for years but this seems to be something I can't overcome. I am also unwilling to take medicine or pay a therapist at this point. Thanks so much for responding.nn\-stressed out guy",0

I hated my life, I was hypercritical of myself and others. at first I thought it’s society’s fault (I live in Saudi Arabia), which was not an uncommon view by people on the internet (which was my source to explore the world around me without the anxiety) specially at that time, it gave me some comfort and hope, because I thought if I got out of there all my troubles would just disappear. when I was 16 I traveled for the first time abroad, I took an English course that summer, oh boy was I so wrong! I was more intimidated and anxious than I ever was before, although my English was better than most of the kids there, but it was not just a language barrier issue. in spite of spending 2 months there, I made no friends and spent most of my time alone. I was devastated, all I could think of was how can I build myself to succeed in that environment, even though my experience was not a blast to see the least, but I saw a great potential in that environment, I worked hard on myself to try to act, think and talk like if I was living there and had (maybe still continue to have) an identity crisis, almost every summer since I was 16 I spent it abroad in different English speaking countries, I’m emphasising on “English” because I used to think it was one of my best assets and it’s my key to engage with others, also I’m very familiar with western culture, but even when I traveled with friends who barely spoke a word of English, they had it better than I did when it came to socialising. I had some good days though, which were the reason that kept me going, but I’m still struggling in that area. at 21 I started to seek professional help and was diagnosed, I was on and off pharmacological treatment during the past 4 years. things are way better now, at least when it comes to socialising with my own community, at least to an extent where I could secure a good job, but I still find it difficult to build relationships with others, and it doesn’t really help having completely different views and value system than people around you that you fear to be ostracised by them if you dared to share them openly.nnthere’s still a long way ahead of me in my journey, but I feel relieved that I can finally feel hopeful about the future.

Then also when I take the bus almost everyday, I feel like everyone is staring at me and judging me, or when I’m in the mall, shopping, sometimes I have to go into a fitting room just to calm down because I feel too anxious. I’ve been trying many different things that I found online like quotes and tips and stuff but they only work for a certain period of time.

I think the worst part of going to school with social anxiety for me apart from peers was always the teachers. I mean I get they have to call on you and get you to participate so they can make an oral grade, but man that should be it.nn I got though that for the first 10 years in school, and still they were constantly getting on my nerves. One teacher in particular. One time, in class, she gave everyone else an assignment and then instead of letting me work like everyone else because, umm, this is class, she proceeded to tell the confident, cool guy to sit next to me and 'get me to talk' like wtf man? This is class, you're not my therapist and that's just so fucking rude. Another time she told me I had to change my personality. Thanks man it's not like I already had zero self esteem before. nnI feel like constantly being told shit like this fucked me up even more than the social anxiety itself because it made me feel like there was something wrong with me.nnAnyway I thought this phase was over, my teachers are now all informed about my SA and are supposed to give me other ways to get oral grades and stop calling on me in class n stuff. But do they do it? Oh boy of course they don't! One teacher still constantly calls on me in class an it's like mate I'm not stupid but I literally freeze up if I'm caught by surprise, like I literally can get a word out. nnBut really a few days ago something happened that really fucking killed everything. So I send my English teacher my homework, so instead of me participating in class she grades that. Which is super nice obviously. So I wrote this essay and I didn't really have a whole lot of time so it turned out super cringey and stupid. So I thought I'd just send it to her because who cares, but then I wouldn't bring it to class because we usually do this thing where we exchange essays in groups and have to review it. And I was uncomfortable with that because I don't really know the people in that class, and I just didn't want them to read that fricking essay.nnSo fast forward to class, I'm sitting with my group and all is well, everyone else reading their essays and I said I forgot mine. Then my teacher comes by. She asks me if I didn't bring my essay (already shitty cause nobody knows I send my essays to her and I intended to keep it that way). So I'm like, no, forgot it. And I figured she'd have the basic amount of human empathy to get that I just didn't want to read it out in front of everyone. But oh boy was I wrong.nnShe literally goes out of the classroom, prints out the essay I sent her and then puts it on my desk and tells me to read it out. Keep in mind, this is not some literary masterwork that my peers absolutely have to hear. It's really shit. I wish I'd just said no in that moment but I just kinda froze up and asked them to just read it like that cause I wasn't comfortable reading it out loud. So one of the guys takes it and starts to read it out loud and this is the most uncomfortable moment of my life oh my God I had a huge panic attack and I keep replaying this moment in my head. Like I literally think about it constantly. This really fucked me up. nnLike if a kid has a physical disability, you don't force it to participate in PE, do you?

My mom is a covert narcissist and I have been bullied since kindergarten and more recently in college and set up by females to be sexually assaulted. That was four years ago but I still feel socially anxious. Like I don't want to be around others bc I feel like they're out to get me like those girls were. Or I always over analyze ppl in social settings bc I'm always wondering what if they're narcissistic like my mom. I also feel lonely a lot but prefer to be alone bc I'm afraid someone is secretly trying to sabotage me. My mom isn't the only narcissist in my family and the girl who tried to set me up to be raped was a narcissist so I feel like all those factors have contributed to me having social anxiety. I wld like an online friend or something. But I'm not ready for the real world thing yet. Sometimes having a narcissistic parent pisses me off.

I deeply regret going. nnI did this 2 hour interrogation basically, with the nurse, who now knows every single detail of my history and life. She went off discussed every thing with the Dr. He very clinically said, I suggest you admit yourself as an inpatient here. I was shocked. He then told me at the very least I need to to a day programme, going there 4 days a week, but that he would recommend becoming an inpatient instead. nnI only wanted CBT and to come off this medication. I never felt so deflated and crushed, I started bursting out crying, felt trapped, and horrified. He then tells me if I make the decision to become an inpatient while I am in the day programme, he will admit me straight away. It was really scary how badly he wanted me to admit myself, no Dr has ever said that before to me. He said the level of care I got is at a low level and he wants to highten it so I am functioning at a high level. nnI then asked when he thinks I can come off this medication, he goes let's get you at a high level of functioning first, so that will be years down the line. I felt like saying that whether I am high functioning or not I will still have withdrawals. I regret going there, giving them all my personal and private information, I feel violated, and would not be comfortable being around that Dr he gave me psycho vibes. Can I call and ask them to delete my data? I feel very uncomfortable. I think maybe this is the push I need to get me to just quit medication cold turkey and go through it myself? Or to find a general doctor to help me. I'm not judging anyone who has been in hospital, I am just saying it scared the crap out of me, how I was treated like a subject of function. nnI actually am working on something I am interested on  so I can hopefully earn money online and travel at some point,  he completely disregarded that as nonsense, because he said we need to get you thinking about a proper career as well, but first lets get you high functioning. I seriously encourage inpatient, it can be a bit scary with all the nurses taking notes and being monitored all the time, but you will get around the clock care, and he we are very caring here, I got this terrifying psycho vibe, when he said how caring they are, I wish I never went there, and they didn't know my information.

6318,"equ95","post","I have no clue what's going on right now","I really hope I am in the right subreddit for this, if not please excuse me. I just have the feeling I need to tell anyone my issues who maybe experienced something similar.nnI'm 24 years old, female and live in germanynnAs a kid I was very violent, I somehow always fought with the boys, in first class I even once hurt a teacher. When something didn't go my way, I threw enormous tantrums until my nose bled. I got smacked until I was like 14 from my dad, first smack bottom, later in the face. I recently got the info that my dad really had issues with being a father and was totally overwhelmed with the new situation, he even was in a psychiatric hospital a few weeks. I now always wonder if this pure anger, frustration, sadness etc is part of my personality or a result of my childhood. Also my parents nearly always said it was my fault when they had an argument about anything affecting me somehow, even as a child of like 3 years old. nBecause of that I had really bad issues socializing as a child. I hardly remember elementary school, but I remember I really hated it. Later I've been bullied for 4 years in the next school (somewhat like high school you could say). When I wanted to solve these problems and asked my parents about it, all I got was ""there are assholes everywhere, learn to deal with them"". The teachers always would say it was because I am the difficult person, so I am myself the cause for being bullied. It even went that far that after there was a school shooting in Germany my bullies would go around tell everyone that I'd had drawn stuff in my books that I'd shoot everyone myself and said such things. No teacher ever checked up on that, neither to protect others from a potential shooter, nor to disrupt these accusations about me. I started cutting myself at that point. If someone noticed in class, they'd just say stuff like ""stop screaming for attention"", once I told my parents but they totally ignored it.nAfter letting everything down in school my parents allowed me to switch schools if I promised to improve my grades again. After that, everything first went great. I grew self esteem, got friends, had hobbies, just a happy life and I had a feeling like nothing could stop me.nI've had a few crisis here and there, e.g. When I stopped University and was insecure about my future, but nothing really heavy again. Then my mother got the diagnosis of a rare form of dementia. My dad is totally overwhelmed with that, too (understandable for me), also because my mom doesn't want to give her independence away and then does stuff like driving with the car to Rotterdam to take a ferry to England and not telling us until she way already at the port.nBut this is also not a new thing to me anymore. I've known this for years and always was able to deal with this. Still going on, doing my stuff.nnBut somehow for a few months now, I've somewhat fallen down. I feel like the teenager again that got bullied and like the little child that always felt like something is always nearly exploding inside of me. On bad days (which are now like every second or third day) I just need a tiny small trigger and start crying, question everything about myself and my life and just generally feel totally worthless and hopeless. And even if I don't have a bad day, I noticed that I am constantly fighting myself in my thoughts, always doubting myself and always feel like everyone is making fun of me again, and that every move of me is harshly criticized by anyone. I just don't feel like the person anymore who grew strong out of my experiences and feel again like the shitty teen I once was, and I have absolutely no idea where that is coming from.nnSorry for this very long text.. I just needed to write it down and hope for someone who maybe has experienced something similar and maybe can give me a Tipp or help or whatever.

I guess I just don’t know how to keep a conversation flowing and I want to cringe every time I attempt it. People laugh because I’m so awkward and nervous when I’m talking. I’ve actually been told that I’m “weird.” nnI’ve tried going out in public on my own more often, just smaller things like going to a fast food place and ordering from the menu. Because I’d avoid that altogether in the past. I still feel so uncomfortable in public though, no matter how much I try and go out…I feel alien and out of place. I feel like everyone is staring at me and they all think I’m weird, although logically I know that’s probably not true. And every little thing makes me self-conscious. I worry about if I look normal, the way I talk, even if I’m walking normally, if I’m blending in with everyone else. It only makes me wish that I could immediately go back home. nnI’ve been trying to hang out…acquaintances I guess you could call them? Since we’re not really close enough to be friends but I was attempting to make friends. I thought I’d found a group where I fit in. I thought everything was going well but then I found out that they were making up reasons why they couldn’t hang out with me. Now I’m just not really trying to hang out with anyone…even people who’ve said they’d like to hang out. I just feel really discouraged and I think I’m more withdrawn than ever now.nnI don’t think I’ll ever belong. I don’t think I’ll ever have friends. If I do have people who want to hang out with me, I always end up screwing it up. Even in the past, talking with people I’ve known for a long time has given me anxiety and eventually, we drift apart. Honestly, I think trying to lessen my social anxiety has only made both my anxiety and my depression worse. Because all I can think is that I don’t fit in anywhere and I’m always going to be alone. I think it’s even made my suicidal thoughts worse. I have tried therapy multiple times in the past but of course, my social anxiety made it hard for me to open up to my therapists and I always ended up quitting. I feel so trapped in my own head pretty much 24/7 and it’s so frustrating but it seems like trying to make it better only makes everything so much worse. nnI guess what I really want to ask is; are things ever going to get better for me? Will I ever be able to feel like I belong here? I think my biggest fear right now is that I’m always going to be an outcast…",1

I’ve been to several therapists and tried all sorts of meds but nothing seems to take away this feeling of misplacement. anxiety is almost like a secondary symptom at this point, i think it stems from a feeling that nothing is real (which is so hard to be talked out of). nnanyways, this anxiety has gotten so bad, whenever I’m in public or with my friends I mumble like crazy. every other thing they ask me to repeat. I’m not doing it on purpose but it’s like my voice is coming from underwater. I’m so spacey all the time I can hardly pay attention to what I’m saying and it’s so draining to try to communicate.

I'm just struggling in my current situation and I'm looking for help, and this just seems like a good way to get unfiltered input. Sorry if this isn't what I'm supposed to be posting or seems rude in anyway, I'm ignorant and desperate.nnI've been struggling with social anxiety and depression for my entire life, and I've been seeking medical help for the past 5 years (I’m 21 now). I can’t function properly because of this, my subconscious just tears me apart in most situations. Nothing in particular triggers this, I’m just constantly uncomfortable outside of my room. I lose jobs because customers get aggressive and I start crying, I can’t use the bathroom when my roommate is home so I have to wait until the next day for them to leave, I’m completely incapable of making friends or forming relationships. It’s just hell, I don’t know how else to put it. I can’t support myself or pursue things I’m passionate about, and I’ve been trying so hard and in every way I can for years to fix this.nnTalking to people is just a constant mental battle of “don’t give them a reason to hate you”, I’m saying and doing whatever I can to make that person like me more. All the while I’m sweating everywhere, my arms are shaking and my legs feel like jelly, and I’m too busy overthinking things to form coherent thoughts and struggle to speak without stuttering. Afterwards I’m full of regret and upset at myself for whatever minute thing I might have done to offend them, or how poorly I performed doing a very basic human task of having a conversation. I’m very self aware of this and it makes trying to continue pursuing these social interactions so discouraging.nnMy doctors have diagnosed me with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and social anxiety, and I’ve been prescribed every medication under the sun including controlled substances, none have lessened the effects. I’ve seen and stopped seeing 5-6 therapists now and all therapy seems to do is ruin whatever day my appointment is on. I've tried most common coping skills and practice some myself to help maintain functionality in stressful environments, but the collapse is inevitable. I’ve only been able to successfully cope with weed and self harm; weed is illegal in my state and while I have my own thoughts on self harm I’d like to stop it in time.nnMy main concern is not being able to support myself, people have suggested that I sign up for disability, which I guess is what I’m doing now. I hate the idea of someone sending me money because I “cry too much”, just makes me feel shitty knowing there’s people out there that would kill for my life. I’ve worked in IT, retail, fast food and sales and every one of them have ended with me crying in front of a customer and asked to leave or just stressing too much about the work to step foot in the door again after a bad day. In the past few months I’ve been trying to find ways to make money from home like selling game goods or freelance audio/video editing on Fiverr but this isn't nearly sufficient enough. I’m in school for NetSec and I’m hoping to land a job I can work from home in the future, but I don’t have a lot of confidence in things turning out ok.nnIt’s so discouraging to push for so long and see no improvement, and all I can do is rinse and repeat.nnNow we get to chapter 2, the depression. I don’t want to get too much into it because you can likely fill in the blanks and there’s no sense complaining about it, but the gist of it is “If I can’t support myself or make friends or do anything outside of sitting in my room and crying, what do I do with my life?” This is constantly running through my mind, just hating myself because I can’t get basic things done in life and being disappointed at the results.nnI don’t know what to do or try at this point, as I stated currently I’m signing up for disability but I’m not confident my request will be granted. I’m researching electroconvulsive therapy because… I don’t know what else to do, and I’m going to start asking my doctors for controlled substances. I obviously don’t want to get addicted to anything or see long term health issues, but like I said weed has helped so sedation = good I guess.nnAny and all input is helpful and greatly appreciated. Thank you.",1

I never get picked in PE even though I’m not terrible at sports, most people don’t even know my name, and I fear that next year when our classes get moved around that I’ll have no one to sit beside.nnI don’t even try to make friends any more because it’s always one-sided (not to mention the anxiety) and I end up exhausted trying to hold a conversation with anyone that isn’t my best friend.

Failing out of school, and I can't get a job anywhere, thanks to debilitating social avoidance. I don't have social anxiety alone, it is generated by paranoia from Schizotypal PD (Or schizoaffective, idk), so it is proving VERY hard to treat, and it's rare enough that I cannot find a therapist. The ones that I find are scared of me and tell me I'm too mentally ill to be treated.nnAs for jobs, and I think this may the case for the entire country I live in (United States), about 80% of jobs seem to be retail or restaurant related. You'd think they'd at least have some stuff dealing with storage, but all the diversity of our original job market (for example before the year 2010) have been exported, so those of us who aren't hyper-social or in some kind of constant drive to seem as uppity or excited as possible don't get accepted in the work place. It's grueling and a waste of time. If anyone lives in any other countries and those countries are more open to business, I'm genuinely thinking about moving to a new country (though I have multiple reasons for doing this). Is there any more diversity to the jobs in Canada or Europe, for example? Are they all the American variety of retail work now? In the past I believe there was more job diversity than we have today.nnI also ask because every job I've worked so far has resulted in a severe abuse dynamic, because I am universally disliked. I was picked on and tormented by three people, verbally criticized by another person every day for a long time. They would figure out ways to take advantage of me and do as much as they possibly could, and while I was working there they tried to sabotage my pay and eventually I got fired and quit because I couldn't handle so much abuse from everyone working together against me.nnI have many artistic abilities but I'm too stupid to know how to market those. I can learn any new set of skills, I know some stuff about programming and can speak other languages, I can play multiple instruments, I am a good driver. Basically the only reason I can't find a job is because of social anxiety and the fact that the only jobs that exist that won't require multiple degrees are retail, and the only ones that exist with a degree require extensive social interaction, all the time, as well as the ability to be absolutely charming.",1

I am already concluding that someone is thinking something before I even do something. nnWhat has helped me is challenging these cognitive distortions. Basically, I would say you should look up a list of cognitive distortions (there are so many lists) and determine which ones relate to you. From there work on changing your thought processes. nnTo give an example, I’ll give an experience that I’ve had which relates to my mind reading. When I start to think everyone is going to think x,y, and z, I can stop myself and say, “I don’t know what they’re thinking. They could be thinking I’m weird but they also may not.

6351,"lolidkgang","post","Do I Have Social Anxiety?","I get that talking to a therapist is probably a way better idea than asking the internet if I have a mental condition but this to me is a sort of first step.nnI am 15 years old and I have always been introverted my entire life. I do have a fair amount of friends at school that I love to death but most times i feel like my own company is all I need. But only a few years back I started really caring about being judged for being alone and stuff like that. nnAt the moment I'm part of the school musical. At the first few rehearsals, I was excited and confident and social because my friends were part of it too, but slowly I noticed my social life started to fade. Whenever I talked to my friends, they would seem bored when they talked to me, only replying with ""ok"" and ""yep"" and ""alright"" and go off to talk to someone I barely knew and seem enthusiastic and engaged in their conversations, this made me extremely self conscious. Most people would make me feel like they were avoiding me, I was talking to two of my friends during rehearsal and they asked me to leave because they were ""talking about something personal"" when all they were doing was just gossiping. And the fact that they didn't even want me to join them would always get me overthinking. Stuff like this would lead to me aimlessly (and awkwardly) walking around the rehearsal room during breaks or sitting by myself on my phone, preferring not to socialise, always looking around for other people being antisocial so I wasn't the only one by them self, so it wouldn't feel like the entire world was staring at me for being the only one by them self. And if I pushed myself to talk to people, I'd have no idea what to talk about. I'd always ask my friends if I was boring to talk too. And even if they said no, it'd be so hard for me to believe them and if they said yes, even in a joking matter, it would hit me so hard. One time the cast of the School musical spent a night at a camp, and all the worries I explained made me feel so sick that I went home early after dinner and came back the next morning.nnI extremely hate family gatherings with a burning fucking passion. Every year my family would spend two weeks up a few hours north from where I live to this really beautiful place. What I seriously didn't like was all the relatives from my dads side all showing up. I would feel like I'm forced to be social with all these people that I barely have anything in common with (not even any of the kids my age) and would choke down desperate feelings of needing time alone or at least surrounding myself with people I'm familiar with. For the first few days I would hate the dinner parties and either hide in the bathroom or hide away in my own hotel room, and ignore the fact i'm missing out and remind myself of the feeling I get when I'm there. And in the next few days I would try to open up but end up following my sister (who is literally the opposite of me when it comes to her social life) nearly everywhere she went. The only time I felt like I could actually feel comfortable and be myself was when it was just my parents and my grandparents and my sister and literally no one else, having conversations.nnI am self conscious of everything that I wear. Part of me wants to stand out and be expressive while the other part of me wants to blend in and not be noticed but the biggest part of me just desperately doesn't want to be judged. If I showed my friends a shirt or a jacket that I liked and wanted. If they had the smallest pause or the slightest look it would send my mind racing. And if people give one stare at what I'm wearing I would just not stop caring about why they stared at my clothes for that one second. If people looked at me and laughed (even if it wasn't about me) it would immediately get me thinking ""they're laughing at what i'm wearing, they think i'm trying too hard, they think I look stupid in these jeans."". nn(also thank you so much that you've read this far and showed that you care, it means a lot to me)nnLike I said, I know asking the internet if I have a mental condition is probably not the best idea but I get the answer I'm looking for, I bet that I can get the confidence to talk to someone like a therapist or a psychiatrist.",0

I would say my depression was much worse before, now I'm mainly dealing with my anxiety. My depression now is mainly triggered by my social anxiety (like I feel bad how i behave in public/around people I care about, then I get depressed). nnEnglish is my second language, when I'm calm, I can speak English just fine, but when I'm anxious and nervous, my English sounds terrible and I sometimes can't even speak a sentence fluently (that is why I failed so many interviews :P). nnMost people think I'm weird because how I behave (like I focus too much on eye contact and that intimidates them... I honestly don't know how to make natural eye contact and am super self conscious about it because I do not want to give a sign that I'm not confident if I avoid eye contact). nnYou know People we interact with in daily life usually do not have knowledge of us having social anxiety, what we act is what they see, and if we are different than most ""normal"" people, we are viewed as weird. It is different than going to therapists that they have knowledge of these sorts of things. that is why I don't feel understood in school/workplace. I often feel I'm isolated and that hurts me a lot. Even when my company is known for its friendly coworkers, I'm still left out in many situations. I'm a nice and sweet person, and always offers to help people, but I can still feel that invisible rejection many times. nnSocial Anxiety is killing my relationship too. Well, technically I have never been in love or a meaningful relationship, it is always one sided or I waste my time with a loser who wants me for sex and stays with me because he can't find a girlfriend. I ruined so many first dates. I tried to dress pretty and act sweet and friendly, but the weird thing is when we hang out in public I panic and act weird, not literally freak out but like for example, if we go to a fancy restaurant on first date, I would be so scared to order food and interact with the waiter, sometimes I can't pronounce the things on menu or say it with very stupid accent, and that leaves my date awkward and end up not wanting to see me again. I want to be confident too and function like a normal person, but I often feel I'm inferior to people. I think this has a lot to do with my experience being in a new country(trying to fit in native people group but got rejected many times) and living with relative who doesn't like me and dealing with long term poverty. Living in an expensive/materialistic area often makes me feel inferior to others too for not having enough money.nnIn April I'm going to meet up with a boy I have been talking with for 4 months, who I have never seen yet. (we matched on bumble). I'm really excited and has good feelings about him but I'm really scared I will ruin my chance to be with him. nn&amp;#x200B;nnSorry for the long writing and if things that don't make sense to you, I'm sorry and please bear with me.

There is a DBT group therapy of 6 girls (19-22 years old) that started at the end of February. The first meet was the 26th and then last Wednesday. With another therapist who I’ve never met. I didn’t show up at the last two (they didn’t put me on the list though so it didn’t matter but this week they did).nnI currently don’t have a job or any friends (haven’t had friends or a job in months, can’t keep either). And i sit in my house most of the time or take my dogs for walks sometimes (but that causes anxiety if it’s crowded on the walking trail).nnI am supposed to see my therapist Thursday and group is tomorrow and I got a group text message as confirmation that group is tomorrow and there’s other girls replying. I never said anything. Someone is bringing their cat and snacks for the group.nnI’m scared there might be people I went to school with there at group (I was bullied a lot and virtually had no friends all 4 years and sat alone at lunch a lot, I have RBF so I guess that doesn’t help and a strong fight or flight response and tend to come off rude when I feel uncomfortable and I shut down). There is someone in the group named Rachel and I knew 3 Rachel’s that went to that school that absolutely hated my guts for no reason and made my life hell.  Idk if it’s her because I don’t know the last name. nnI’m also scared they are going to judge me (you know the looks on peoples faces to know they are judging you, that certain look and then the way they look at others after looking at you or if they start whispering) and won’t like me for whatever reason.nnI’m having massive anxiety thinking about it, my therapist thinks it would be good for me to try it out so we can use some of what they teach me there in our 1 on 1 sessions and so I can potential try to make friends. She also told me about meet me.com meet ups and I’m too scared to do that, I don’t trust people and I hate driving. Driving gives me massive anxiety.nnHell going to the grocery store is a complete nightmare which is why my parents go most of the time for me. I always feel like people hate me.",1

At the beginning of the year, I had begun to attend my first year of university for a B/Engineering &amp; B/Arts, but after around a month, I wanted to postpone my studies until next year due to a number of reasons (wasn't enjoying the courses I chose, no Job, not going to the gym, no licence, crippling anxiety, social issues and my parents financial troubles \[Dad was fired and mum had to leave work for her health\] that happened at the end of last year). So I had decided to defer my studies and work on these problems by earning money, getting my licence and boosting my own self-esteem through therapy and exercise.nnIt all seemed pretty simple, yet it's been around three weeks since I left Uni and I haven't made any progress in any of those areas; Im sorry if this post seems abit over the top, but this is my first time trying to solve all these adult problems totally alone, and im finding it difficult to deal with. The only income I have coming is my youth allowance ($257/fortnight). And since I deferred my studies, im just waiting for my allowance to be cut.nnMy entire family is extremely busy these days and all of them are under a lot of stress and are thus unable to help me or walk me through how to do things.nn As right now, I've written my resume but I keep having anxiety attacks, when I try to send my resume or request an interview from unfamiliar places. I had also hoped to at least book my driving test by now to boost my self-esteem and make it easier to get an easy low paying job, but it hasn't worked out as I had liked.nnSo, I was wondering whether anyone on here had any advice on ways to just dig myself out of this rut that Ive been in for the past three weeks (or three months - depending on the way you look at it) and to tell me how im supposed to go through with things that make me wanna walk into the woods and never go back.

All through my teenage years and school life, I’ve NEVER had a friend group and was never popular. I was never bullied or anything, I was too quiet and socially anxious. People were really nice to me, but I always struggled to communicate with others. I can’t hold a conversation at all, let alone start one. I was often excluded and left out in school and it was so embarrassing and it hurt. One time it was Valentine’s Day and it was a tradition to for everyone to give crush sodas and chocolates to their friends and people they liked. Most of the time I got some, but one year I didn’t receive anything at all and I was literally trying so hard to fight back tears. One of the popular girls (these girls weren’t ever mean to anyone btw and they were nice to me and there wasn’t really much bullying in my school at all), gave a few of their crush sodas to me and it made me feel a little bit better, I was touched. But I never really had a social life. I’ve never even once in my life knew what it’s like to have even one small friend group. Another thing is that I was chubby back then, actually I was three pounds overweight and my weight mostly maintained on the heavier side of healthy back then. But now I’m skinny, actually I’m a few pounds underweight but you can see just how tiny I’ve become. The bad part is that I only lost all this weight AFTER I had already graduated from high school. If I done it much sooner, I feel like I would’ve been a lot more confident back then and would’ve been a little more popular and outgoing. I regret not working harder to lose all that weight back then. So I guess you could say I had my “glow up” a little too late. I mean I’m still very young, only 21 but I wish it happened while I was still in school so everyone could be shook at my transformation. But this year will be my year to make up for my lack of friendships and popularity in school. I will make sure I overcome my social anxiety little by little, and hopefully I’ll have many friends by the end of this year. I’m so sick and tired of living like this, it’s giving me depression. I just got done having my second mental break down crying session over it. I hope to become a bubbly outgoing social butterfly very soon, and I really need encouragement and maybe some tips on how to make that seem a little easier without letting my social anxiety get in the way.",0

I've struggled with debilitating social anxiety since I was very young (25M), and it's really starting to get in the way of me making any progress in life. nnI've come across this London based clinic that offer a two-session program that utilises The Fast Phobia Cure ([https://www.phobiaclinic.co.uk/the-fast-phobia-cure](https://www.phobiaclinic.co.uk/the-fast-phobia-cure)) to supposedly dissociate your emotional connection to the fear, and eliminate it.nnI had a consultation with the lead therapist today, and it was pretty positive.

6370,"Youre_Grounded","post","What type of anxiety is this?","I posted this in another subreddit, I hope that’s okay. I want as many opinions as possible. nnnI was diagnosed with social anxiety when I was a teenager but honestly, what I deal with doesn’t really sound like social anxiety. Yes my anxiety is focused around people, but I’m more anxious around my friends and family than strangers or crowds. And not in a “everyone hates me/is annoyed with me” kind of way. nnnMy anxiety is more like... wanting to be invisible. I don’t want anyone aware of my presence, ever. I’m anxious of doing anything that might make me stand out or get people’s attention. I hold myself back. Like, everything about myself. I’m scared to speak up, I’m scared to let out my emotions. I’m scared to be who I want to be. I don’t change anything about myself because change causes unwanted attention. I’ve been wearing the same clothing style since high school (I’m 24). I’ve slowly introduced new things to my wardrobe but not enough to make people go “WOW!”. Like, I’ll still never wear a dress or a skirt even though I really want to because I was a tomboy as a child even though I’m not anymore. Even if it’s positive attention I’ll get, I don’t want any of it. No attention what so ever. nnnI’m hyper-aware of my own presence. I walk quietly, I talk quietly, I do things quietly. I am SO gentle when doing things. I’m so careful not to make any noise. Like doing the dishes gives me anxiety because the sound of cutlery or glass clanking against each other is loud. I’m anxious when I make tea because the kettle is loud. I’m anxious to make food because they can smell it. Im anxious to watch funny videos or look at memes because I might laugh. I’m anxious about doing normal, everyday stuff because it will draw attention to me. nnnIs this still considered social anxiety??",1

Unless someone is genuinely nice, and they act that way towards everyone. Then ok, fine.

As soon as I sense that somebody is talking to me as the “quiet-shy guy”, I immediately lose interest in talking to them. Would I rather people be rude?

And when I'd speak at a normal volume, she'd tell me I'm being too loud (she would usually only do this if other kids were around). Also, if I quietly sang, she'd tell me that I'm weird for singing when there's the possibility that someone could hear me. She never said anything like this to her friends, only to me. I noticed that after this, I became more concious of how I act in front of anyone, and can't feel comfortable around anyone. I also have zero friends, yet she has a lot. She still says similar things to this very day. For example, after an interaction with her friend, she said to me ""why did you laugh so much?

6378,"leilani0702","post","How can I change so people can stop using labels like “shy, quiet, calm, soft-spoken”?","Sorry for ranting for so long but I just had to get this out somewhere.nnI’m a 17-year-old high school student. In elementary school (the education system is a little different in my country, so let’s say I was 10-13 years old at that time) I was painfully shy. I think I had severe social anxiety but it was never diagnosed because I never went to a psychologist.nnThe school I went to was a dance school (there were normal classes as well) and the teachers were very toxic, they were yelling quite often and hitting students too. I’ve always been an introvert since I was a child but then I started to become really shy. And the attitude of my teachers didn’t help. They would often make fun of me saying “you don’t talk” or “wow she said something” when I’d be brave enough to speak up. Once my teacher told me to tell my class something and I said okay because I didn’t have any problems with that and she said “if you’re capable to” with a smile and that hurt me. Maybe she didn’t mean to be hurtful but her facial expression and her tone of voice really hurt me that day. nnAlso one of my dance teachers told me I won’t be a good dancer because I’m an introvert and she doesn’t think I will ever be able to perform as well as the extroverted dancers. I felt really sad that day. I was hearing stuff like this so often that I decided to change schools. nI went to the middle school at the age of 14 and I had a fresh start- I wanted to show people that I’m not shy and quiet anymore- the only problem was that I still had social anxiety. I thought that maybe with this new environment I’d be able to change my personality a little, become more confident and talkative with no one being surprised about it. But very quickly I found out how toxic the class was. I didn’t have any bullies before but now I did. So many girls at that class hated me from the beginning and you may think that this is just what I was telling myself but I don’t think so. nnI wanted to be friends with a group of girls but they rejected me instantly (I managed to become friends with one of the girls and she later told me it was true, one of these girls decided that they just aren’t going to be friends with me before they even got to know me because she was jealous of her other friend). Then I tried to become friends with an other girl. She was sitting alone because her friend was absent that day so I thought I’d come up to her and introduce myself. When I came up to her I asked her if I can sit with her, I sat at the chair and she told me that no and then to other girls overheard this conversation and asked the girl “what is she doing here? (me)” and the girl replied “I don’t know” as if I weren’t there. nnThere was also a girl who was so mean to me, once I heard her talking about me behind my back when I was walking behind her and her friend told her that I’m behind her and she looked at me, started laughing and said something like “oh I don’t care”. There was also a game during one lesson when everyone had their own sheet of paper and it was passed to everyone and everybody had to write something about you on that paper. I got one particularly mean thing written on my (later my friend told me that it’s from that girl). She wrote something like “you never talk, no one pays attention to you, do you even exist?” I know maybe it seems funny but I just wanted to cry there but I couldn’t. Instead I waited and cried about it when I got home and burned the paper. nnOther kids bullied me to.nAt this school I met one girl from the other class who was particularly kind too me and she was very sociable and she helped me a lot. I gained a lot of confidence while I was friends with her. nI decided I don’t want to be perceived as the boring, quiet kid anymore and I really opened up, I started to be less shy and opened up more.nThis year I went to high school. When I met all these people I really talked a lot, made a lot of friends and was really confident at least for my standards haha and I thought this is how I’d be perceived by others. I have really changed, it was so hard and it cost me so much work but it was worth it. nnAnyway this is what I need advice with. People still label me as “shy, quiet soft spoken”. Recently I asked my friend if she thinks I’m shy and she said that yes a little. This is what my English teacher wrote in a teacher’s recommendation I needed for an exchange scholarship program I wanted to participate in:n“The student knows how to behave well, she is calm, quiet, rather shy and soft-spoken. When she has to, she cooperated with other students . I think she prefers working on her own. She is helpful, responsible and well liked at school”. She also rated my openness rather low and my leadership skills below average.nnWhat hurts me the most is the amount of work I put into changing my personality, trying to become more open, talking a lot, being outgoing, speaking louder yet people still give me the same old labels. Has anyone had a similar problem before. How do I change so that people think I’m a confident person. I thought I already was but turns out everyone that I know perceives me as shy. What else can I change? Will trying to talk louder help? I don’t know why the teacher judged my leadership skills like this because we never did anything during English lessons to demonstrate our leadership skills so why does she assume. nnI like to cooperate with other people, again during English classes we don’t do anything to show this ability. Please, can someone tell me what to do, I don’t want to be perceived as shy and week by others forever yet nothing I do seems to change what they think of me. It really hurts that I tried to change something about myself and I thought I succeeded but no one else noticed. Still same old labels.",0

The last one is uncertain, because I haven't seen a therapist in years and I'm too scared to call one.nnnI've been alone for my entire life. I've had a few friends, but none who I'm really close to. With the one notable exception I've never dated anyone, never been in a relationship. A complete loner.nnnI've made some posts where I've told more about this one exception, and I'll link them here. nnnThe short version is that I was seeing her for several months and during that time I was happier than I think I've ever been.

I was doing better in college but I ran out of meds around mid to late October and got help a bit too late. And because of that, my grades had fallen which led me to be suspended and go back home. And since then, my family wants me to go back to school, to which I don't mind doing, but to my hometown instead, which I don't want to do for fear of seeing old classmates from high school.nnAnd because of all this pressuring from my parents, I've been admitted to a mental hospital (by my own terms), my last therapy session was 2 months before I was admitted, my last session with my doctor was a month ago, and my sessions with both have been limited since I didn't show up, but couldn't because of me being in a different town and no ways of transport.nnSo now I have to make a phone call to request a refill and a session with my doctor. My dad used to be the one to call in for me. They listened and didn't mind, but since they found out that I'm 21, now they want to hear from me and I'm really nervous I'm gonna make a fool of myself. I know it's over the phone and they probably won't judge me stuttering and such but I can't help but worry. But I'm feeling a lot worse than I was before so I got no choice but to call in, and I really don't want to go back to the hospital. It was a terrifying experience but that story is for another time.",1

I'm not sure what exactly triggered this, but I have been an anxious mess for the past week or so.nnMaybe it's the stress of school, or the current state of the world, or maybe even that I've been smoking more weed than I normally do? nnI guess it started after my boyfriend had a friend over last month; a friend I don't really known well. He seems like a decent person and someone I could potentially call a friend as well. I saw this as an opportunity to come out of my shell a little bit (I usually dont say much when we have people over because I'm so socially anxious and awkward). Overall it went pretty well, and for the first time in ages, I left a social interaction feeling somewhat good!!nnThe next time my boyfriend had this friend over (a couple weeks later), it didn't go as well. I was excited because I wanted to work on my social skills again (because social anxiety has robbed me of that), and also because it's nice to actually hang out with other human beings. nnTo say the least, I was pretty disappointed. I felt like a total idiot the whole time because I was so quiet and stuttered a few times. nnHe ended up crashing on our couch, so I figured that at least I had a chance to redeem myself from that awkward and depressing night. I was a little bit more social, but I couldn't help but feel incredibly awkward and incredibly uncomfortable.nnEver since then, that feeling has not left.

Now I'm an adult and it's worse since we started wearing masks. I got use to hiding behind my mask and I'm confident behind my mask but when I remove it then I look nervous and uncomfortable even when people look at me like to talk to me. It's like i get a rush thru my body and a shock I'm so scared people notice and think im weird. I have extreme fear of them judging me or noticing. I feel better when I'm the one talking. Whenever I went to school or in the neighbourhood, I was either laughed at or hated on. I also have fear of not being liked so im quiet and not talkative. People assume I'm weird or don't like them so they don't like me back but most of the time people never liked me. nnHow can I stop feeling this way. If I had to sit in a group of people, I'll be very embarrassed with my nervous actions and wouldn't even know how to sit on a chair. I feel like I'll never overcome it.

Very ugly rumours. When I started working then there's always someone that dislikes me for no reason.

Almost 20 years.

I always use push to talk, I get very anxious in silence so I make a lot of small noises but I want to be considerate of others. Most of my noises are things like loud typing or tapping, humming, sometimes I’ll say a thought out loud or chuckle to myself if I think of something funny. nnWe played earlier tonight and connection was a little wonky, others were complaining of background noise. I checked my mic, I was on PTT so I thought I was good. Nope. One of the other programs *also* had a built in mic that I didn’t know about and which was not muted. I didn’t discover this until a several minutes in. They others had to sit through several minutes of my humming, tapping and whispering thoughts aloud to myself, and were too polite to directly ask me to check my mic again. We played the rest of the game and had a great time, no one said anything at any point, but in the back of my mind I wanted to die of embarrassment the whole time.nnI appreciate that no one said anything, but that hasn’t stopped my anxiety from fixating on how weird or annoying they must think I am. I’m the newest player in this group, so I’m already self-conscious about the fact that they have to help me more often than anyone else in the group. I’ve run through my usual routine to talk myself out of the anxiety, but it’s not working. I can’t convince myself that they will forget it by next session, even though I know most people don’t care to remember that type of stuff.

6412,"believinghollywood","post","Venting","nI’ve been thinking a lot about where it went wrong and why I’m not the same as everyone else. It was only recently I learned I might have SA, I don’t wanna put that label on myself because it’s only been mentioned once but i know for sure that I have anxiety. I think my family had a lot to do with it. My mom suffered from postpartum when she had my older brother and it really changed her life and my parents relationship. I dont know how exactly because i dont know that person before I just know who she is now. But as I got older and her too, it seems like her anxiety got worse kind of. She’s become more avoidant to social situations and friends. I’m terrified of a lot of things now. Change, family, making friends, going out. I used to feel scared but I knew I was capable so I pushed past. Now I feel stuck and paralyzed. And I feel like I wasted 3 years of my life being afraid. I hate that i feel this way and I hate having regrets. This is no way to live a life. I’m scared for my parents marriage because my mom doesn’t get the help she probably really needs and takes it out on us, I feel bad for her too so I’m not angry. But I’m also terrified for if my dad dies before her, because i know I can’t take care of her and i know in the state she’s in she’ll never survive it. My dads not sick or anything but I think about it a lot. I think about when they fight and I fear if they ever break up, and I fear for what would happen if I moved out and would it cause them to break up. My mom is a very dependent person, and she started to depend on me a couple of years ago. I felt guilty for hanging out with friends and working and just not being home because it would make her so sad. So I stopped going out as much and stuff. Now I’m afraid of all of these things. I dont know what to do or where to turn. I’m in therapy because I want to feel better so bad but I’m worried that I’ll never get better if my parents don’t try to get better too. I can’t think about them being unhappy because it breaks my heart. They’re been great parents and have so much love for me and my brother, but I’m so scared. I can’t move on from home and I feel stuck here. When I leave I think it will destroy me because I’ll be helpless and I’ll miss them too. I miss when my parents actually went out and had fun with their friends because it encouraged me to do so as well. If they end up being sad old people with no friends who just sit inside all the time it will crush me and I will feel guilty for the rest of my life. Anyone else have a similar experience? I just really needed to share, I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this stuff. nnTLDR; Family might have caused my social anxiety. I’m scared for what’s next and I feel stuck. Just want someone to talk to",1
6413,"yesthrowitaway422","post","Could I have social anxiety?","This will be really long. So sorry.nnOkay, so my (21f) issues started back in high school, maybe sophomore year to be specific. I began feeling really paranoid of other students around me, thinking that they were talking bad about me behind my back. I became reclusive as a result. I’m not a shy person, I wasn’t a shy kid either and so this all just seemed to hit out of nowhere. If my group of friends were holding a conversation without me or laughing without me, I would barge into the conversation to ask if they were talking (bad stuff) about me. They’d laugh and say no, maybe they thought I was joking but I wasn’t. They never gave me a reason to believe that, but still the thoughts remained. Good part was though once I got over the feeling, it was over, until the next time I felt that way. Starting college, things were significantly worse. Presentations became a tedious task, even though the classrooms are the same size as they were in high school (community college). Day of presentation, I’d be furiously going over my note cards, my palms would sweat, my hands would shake. I’d even leave the room because I’d start crying uncontrollably. It wasn’t that I was nervous of my classmates or in fear of messing up or wondering what they would think. I think it was mostly the anticipation of it all. Once it was my turn, I’d force myself to present anyway because most professors give a failing grade for the course if you refuse. My voice would shake as if I were going to cry again, but once it was over it felt like a huge weight being lifted and I could think again. nnAnd my thoughts that others were talking about me, only intensified. Most recently, I had a two hour biology lab class. I usually sat in front of some students that I normally talked with. However when I walked in and took my seat, they were laughing and talking with one another. In that moment I became so small, automatically feeling like they were saying bad things about me. I didn’t have the courage to ask like I would’ve done in high school. I didn’t need to. See, in high school, if they said they weren’t talking about me—then they weren’t. But now, I didn’t need to ask because deep down in my heart I knew. In situations like these, it’s hard to calm me down. I packed up my school supplies and left not even five minutes after. Ran to the bathroom and cried like a baby, then I called my friend to let her know that I was being talked about again. She tried to calm me down and told me that they probably weren’t. I didn’t believe her, and decided that she couldn’t possibly understand. Then I went home, causing my biology grade to suffer.nnIt doesn’t end there. In fact, I feel like it progressed. Nowadays I feel that others, as in other people, are plotting against me to get under my skin. In public, if I see a stranger in the same aisle as me twice or three times, I wonder if they’re planning to kidnap me or murder me. I worry that I’m being followed home all the time. I worry that the woman next to me is chewing her gum obnoxiously to irritate me on purpose. At home, it’s worse. I have this horrible feeling that I don’t belong and that I’m not wanted so I guess it causes me to project bad vibes into the house. nnI live with my aunt, so if something in the kitchen is hidden from my view, meaning I have to move things around and look for it, I assume that she’s purposely hidden it to keep me away from it. If I eat the last of something, or open something that has not yet been opened, then she’s going to blow up at me. Even though this has never happened. We recently moved into a new home, and I believe that she gave me, what she believed to be the worst bedroom in the house. There’s not really anything wrong with it but I have this strange thought that she and my older cousin put their heads together and decided that I would get this bedroom because they don’t like it and so I deserve the worst one. If the two are talking in the next room, I assume it’s about me. I assume that they talk about me in the next room on purpose, they know I am listening and they want me to hear.nnBut I don’t have anywhere to go in this situation. So I stay in my room all day long, getting more frustrated by the minute until I have a raging headache and their laughter pounds in my ears. I feel like they are always hostile towards me, even if this isn’t true. Conversations always feel forced and awkward on my end. I never know what to say, or what to do with my face, or make eye contact. I’m always two seconds behind in the conversation and can never hold my thoughts together long enough to form a proper sentence. As if I’ve forgotten the most common english words. This turns into me having a general idea of what I want to say next, and the sentenced comes out completely jumbled, like the words are not in their right position. Sometimes I don’t even finish the sentence and just trail off or abruptly end wherever. I’ve been told that it’s hard to understand what I’m trying to say.nnThis is really embarrassing and I don’t know why it happens. They’re my family. And I’m not nervous in conversations... it’s just that the words aren’t there. Like they took a vacation or something. nnThe biggest problems though are my moodiness and inability to connect with others. My mood fluctuates between irritable, frustrated, and general discontent with life. Sometimes I’ll feel really sad, lonely or suicidal. It feels like I don’t relate to anyone, not just on a personality level, but even on a broader scale. I feel vastly different. Best way to put it: if everyone on Earth was known as Human 1, I’d be Human 2. Just the way that I view myself. nnOkay this is way too long :( I’m gonna cram everything else in here. Social events are a dread, I generally have grey thinking, if you ask what I think of something I either don’t know or care because I’m stuck in the grey area, very indecisive, I have a hard time practicing good hygiene, my motivation is in the garbage, even though I’m never happy, nothing makes me happy or feel pleasure, I find it hard to cry unless I’m unbelievably frustrated, I’ve abandoned all hobbies, very poor memory (forgetting what I previously said in conversation, forgetting routine chores), nnOther things that are very important to add, though not as common. Sometimes at night I’ll feel bugs crawling all over me? It feels so real and I scratch and whine until I’m read. Then I cut the light on and there’s nothing there. Or if I’m thinking, another voice will say something. It’s never mine and it never contributes anything to what I’m thinking about, like it’s completely random. Whenever I’m thinking to myself about anything really, I refer to myself as me, my, I, normal right? But if I’m thinking bad thoughts about myself, usually about how someone hates me, I refer to myself as you. ex: “no one’s thinking of you”, “she doesn’t like you”, “of course he doesn’t want to sit near you you’re disgusting”. This was very very usual behavior for me up until recently when I discovered that it may not be normal.nnJust to be clear, while theses are all issues and interfere with my ability to lead a normal life, my biggest problems are the paranoia, bad thoughts, and the lack of social skills. As well as irritable or sad mood.nnAnyway, is this a really bad case of anxiety and should I see a doctor? Or am I just worrying over nothing?",0

Having been bullied pretty nastily for a year and then having no friends. Then transferring to a new school, losing all my friends. That was ages ago and if I mentioned this to people at all they probably wouldn’t remember but it has most definitely scarred me. The effects have started emerging recently, causing full blown anxiety and panic attacks. Talking to my therapist yesterday, I realised that deep down I was afraid of being left or bullied. This is where my social anxiety comes in, absolutely trying to be normal and not say/do anything weird. I guess all along it was trying to protect me, but none of can go on like this. So yeah, taking this into social contexts I now see why I was so afraid of just speaking.

Sometimes they’ll be joking around and then later on approach me alone and be like “You know I was just kidding about that stuff I said earlier, just wanted to make sure you knew.” Sometimes if I say something witty back they think I got offended and say “oh you know I was just kidding.” What I do find offending is that people think they need to baby me and watch what they say around me.

The question itself gives me so much anxiety and every time i think about it I can’t help but feel like crying.

I had Facebook, twitter, Snapchat, instagram BRIEFLY early on in high school, but never used it. I had a very controlling father and family issues growing up so I thought well if I can’t go out there’s no point to engaging with friends online. As family dynamics evolved after high school, I still never bothered with social media. For the longest time I felt I was fine without it because I like the privacy and I always never have enough time anyway. Many people who’ve come and gone in my life ask me how I get by without it, I guess I just found it easier to not have to continue the relationship and just cut them off. It feels very alienating at the same time though since I feel like I’m missing out on great friendships. I just stuck with the same few people in uni, then lost contact with them too.nnI’ve only been recently diagnosed with GAD and social anxiety, but looking back I’ve been anxious throughout my life. Ok so in efforts on trying to work through this, I got instagram a couple months ago. Seeing people from my past has been SO overwhelming. I limited it to following a few people a day. I debated for the longest time whether to post or not. On one hand it was really nice to see how everyone’s lives have changed, but man all the anxiety flooded in. Only 4 people messaged me out of the 40 people so far that I thought were old friends. I know it’s trivial to look at numbers but I can’t help it. I also know they have their own lives going on and I shouldn’t take it as a personal attack, but they know how long it’s been since we’ve last made contact once they followed back. I can’t help but think that if they cared, they’d reach out. At the same time I know I have to make an effort too, so I’ve been texting people one at a time but it just dies quickly. They stop messaging. I just find it all too exhausting and draining. I haven’t made a post and now I avoid the app entirely.nnI feel like I don’t know how to sustain relationships in general. I feel like my current relationships with my main friend group and coworkers are not genuine. I doubt their intentions and I feel like my coworkers are uncomfortable being around me. I’m back in school trying to get used to the environment but it’s like I forgot how to interact or approach others. My 6 year relationship with my boyfriend ended, it took a long time to open up to him and it ended cause my mental health issues just got too overwhelming and it wasn’t fair to him. He needed his space and said he needed to work through his own mental health issues too. I just feel incredibly alone.",1

I just don’t know how to stay consistent and be myself all the time without thinking “oh god im sweating and my heart is beating fast.. they definitely noticed my shaky voice”. Man sometimes I can’t even tella short story even around my family and in other times i can tell jokes all night long. So my question is that is this a sign of improvement? Did anyone go through such a thing? nnIm sick and tired of feeling self conscious all the time overthinking every little step i make in my lifennPlz help me",0

6447,"rancorancar","post","i feel a sense of doom","I feel this deep sense of doom. I've been feeling this way for a couple of days now.nnTo start, I'll mention that I am a 17-year-old girl in high school. My biggest issue at the moment is my schoolwork. I'm to scared to start any of it. I have an issue with handing in assignments that I don't feel are properly completed in that way I'd like them to. This has prevented me from handing in these assignments because everything isn't done in the way I want it. Sometimes I'll finish enough of the assignment to be credited an 80-90% but I still don't hand it in. This has been killing my grade atm.nnMy other issue is moving past embarrassing moments in the past. I'll just replay these moments, many of which have happened at school. This then becomes me worrying about what my teachers think of me. I usually don't care what others think and I understand that people think of us less than we think they do, but this is something that seriously bothers me. I'll over analyze hand gestures, body turns, facial expressions, and tone of voice.nnThis is depressing me deeply. Additionally, overanalyzing my work has prevented me from completing it this quarantine (affecting my grade), which in turn puts me in a constant state of misery. I'm so lost. I don't even know where to start, my mom is not much of an option, I haven't been able to reach a therapist, and I don't want to reach out to any of my teachers because they're already swamped with work and I don't want to be a bother.",0

6449,"Pelios_","post","Social Anxiety: The Essentials","After looking around, I felt that sharing my story may help others. And in some way make all the pointless suffering mean something if it helps or resonates with one person.nnPreface: I am a 24-year-old college grad whos spent countless years languishing in deep thought/fear/pain about their own behaviors and emotions. Probably have had more internal conversations than external ones.  Crushed at times under the carousel of depression/self-loathing. Other times crippled so badly by fears of judgments that basic human tasks become sources of complete life-threatening terror.  This becomes further compounded when those ""loved ones"" around you gladly and publicly point out your fears as if exposing you will somehow make you stronger. All of this and more! As I share my failures, my victories, and continuous battle with social anxiety.nn&amp;#x200B;nnThe best way to tell this story is perhaps through pain points of the past, present,(and even future). So I will just dive in no particular order.nn&amp;#x200B;nnThe PhonennWho knew a modern wonder of tech that is supposed to connect us could also be the source of such bone-numbing fear. I think it all started back in 1st grade. A girl gave me her phone number (remember I am like 7). After school I called, and we engaged in the most 7-year-old conversation ever. So basically a conversation about nothing. Afterward, I found out that my Mom and Brother had picked up the downstairs phone and listened to the whole thing. They then for weeks afterward mocked me and repeated what I said on the phone. Talk about traumas to an undefined child. It's events such as those that drive you to form opinions about yourself and make an early association with fear and speaking on the phone. Fast forward and think of all the times (starting from age 7) you have had to speak on the phone. Now imagine each time the thought of using a phone is so horrible it turns your stomach over. Social anxiety in a nutshell. I've found that with time receiving a phone call was the easier evil. Somehow it being unexpected and someone else initiating the conversation took the edge off it. Having lived into adulthood, phone calls are inevitable so you eventually (through exposure) adapt and develop a tolerance for them. Yet even so to this day placing a phone call to someone is still sometimes a shaky voice and sweaty palm event, particularly when its phone interview. I have one coming up in a few days and dread the idea of literally taking a phone call to be judged by someone. And don't even get me started on making or taking a call in a quiet office space. nnAdvice: Slowly Expose yourself (naturally through time or forcibly by need) to phone interactions. Next time you order food try calling instead of making your mom do it/using an app. Make a doctor's appointment. Usually calling places that handle constant phone calls ( docs/food/customer service) are the easiest to make because you know what you need to say and the person usually is going off a script. It's scary (trust me), but you can work up to it. I avoided using the phone until it became ridiculous for my age and just faced it through trial and error.nn&amp;#x200B;nnThe Checkout ExperiencennFor the LONGEST time growing up this was another point of contact for me and my social anxiety.  Having to go alone to a counter and ask/buy something. I really honed my avoidance maneuvers. Giving money to friends to buy my ticket. Walking together up to the counter with someone and throwing my order on theirs so at least I wasn't alone doing it. Or just flat out avoided buying things or asking for help. It's so ingrained in me that I walk into places today and am still so determined to figure out things for myself and not ask employees/help desks for information. Just the thought of having to do it/entering a situation where you know its coming would fill me with red hot anxiety. Like I could run away on the spot. This one really holds you back in life. Today I am more accustomed to it. I  worked in retail behind the counter for 4-5 years through college. (that was it's own personal hell). But I kinda reduced the fear a lot over time. I went to go buy a cable recently from an electronic store. I couldn't find it anywhere. Eventually, I approached a worker and said ""Where are the ethernet cables"". He looked so confused and said ""WHAT?"". The worst thing to hear with as someone with anxiety. In a split second you feel nervous, ask yourself ""What did I say wrong? Is this guy going to yell at me?"" Turning inwards and feeling all insecurities explode out into your focus. I said again more loudly ""ETHERNET cables"", and he turned and showed me where they where. Little moments like this, I imagine other people don't remember or acknowledge the way I do. The fact that something so small and unimportant stuck with me for me to be able to write about shows how impactful anxiety is on you. The fixation on past ""failures"" or ""awkward moments"". Yet logic tells me that It's unlikely the worker in that story noticed or cared about my behavior and certainly did not judge me at that moment. If he did, why does it matter so much? These are the sometimes underlying thoughts one must grapple with. The emotions V.S rational thoughts. You feel things that are unpleasant caused by common situations and don't understand/get angry with yourself over those feelings. Then you tell yourself what other people think doesn't matter, then go back to feeling those emotions again.nn My advice: This one is more tricky because as long as your polite and to the point you can minimize how much you actually have to speak to someone behind the counter. And often if you come into a place prepared you don't have to interact at all (Digital tickets/know where you're going). If this is something you want to overcome, try ordering food in person at McDonald's. (Probably where I first started practicing unknowingly). It's simpler because your just reading from the menu and someone can stand near you if you need it. If you're like me choose one that's not so busy, sometimes the energy of a big crowd can overwhelm your senses. I think remembering the person your speaking to is usually trying to do their job or just answer your question or help you can ease the nerves. nn&amp;#x200B;nnThe kids ""going through changes"" nnNot here to repeat any cliches about puberty. Just to note how much more difficult it is to adapt to changes when you're socially anxious. My mom would always say ""you're going through the CHANGE"". I grew leg hair early and it was a lot. It was something my mom especially would comment on. She/ other family would ALWAYS highlight imperfections or changes they noticed on my body. Leg hair, arm hair, acne, height, weight, posture. It's hard enough braving middle school with asshole peers but your own fam making you feel inadequate through teasing is hard. I started just covering everything. Wore long pants all summer, stated avoiding the pool, or exposing too much. Essentially lived like a victorian woman in 1890's. I was so uncomfortable with showing my legs or anything I felt was ""not normal"" I would rather sweat and boil in summer heat then show off my body. This lasted through to high school. Eventually with time It stopped being such a big deal to me. I can only describe it as one day, you wake up, and feel no emotions(or fewer emotions) triggered at the thought of doing the act. So then you just wear shorts. Or show off your body more. Today I am mainly uncomfortable about my weight. I still feel embarrassed about taking my shirt off. I rationally acknowledge that I don't think I'm actually as overweight as I think I am and people probably don't see me as fat as I see me. I CAN take my shirt off, but I avoid going to the beach or pools because I compare myself to other more fit people, and feel so unhappy with how I look. This may sound all cliche, but anxiety really takes these things and cranks the dial up to 11. It really impacts your ability to function and changes so much about how you act/what you do/where you go. nnAdvice: This one I'm still working on. I think it's an uphill battle (than can be won) if you change how you think. Maturity helps a lot. Getting older and leaving behind all those teenage ideals about judgments. And judging yourself less harshly. I think that's a key to a lot of this. Remember that nobody externally can COME CLOSE to judging as nastily and self-degradingly as yourself. Other people don't experience your day from begging to end. Only you live with all of your memories, behavior, experiences. And therefore the only thing in your control is to slowly change how you react and feel about them. I often say to myself ""be kind to yourself"". It sounds like something you see on a motivational poster in an elementary school hallway. But it's truly worth working on. I think if you stop judging yourself and holding yourself to unrealistic standards of ""perfection"", you can start working on overcoming challenges and having small victories. I saw the path to overcoming anxiety as a straight line with total victory as the goal. But this is not a pass/fail experience! Every phone call, every conversation, I got a little better. You just gotta keep focusing on the victories. (This one sounded preachy but it's my truth.) nnOne thing I heard was this: Imagine your traveling along the same road each day. The road is full of potholes. You keep walking along and without fail always fall into the potholes. For years you keep traveling the same road and keep falling in the potholes. Eventually, your become a little more alert and move out of the way of one pothole. You avoided it. The next day you fall back into the same pothole. This cycle repeats. Yet over time there are changes. Sometimes you avoid potholes. The time it takes for you to pull yourself out of the potholes is shortened. (not doing the analogy justice but you get the point) nnI felt like this resonated with my life a little. It taught me that overcoming social anxiety is about the progress you make each day and not about achieving some goal of perfection or ""being more normal"". Take a moment and consider how different you are from 1 year ago, and then 5 years ago? I used to be so crippled by anxiety I basically couldn't do anything. Yet somehow I graduated college, survived solo presentation and group projects, worked a retail job, then worked in an office. So if you really want to change, start small and don't give up. The past few days I've been really anxious and depressed on and off. So it's still something I carry with me. But I'm still here pushing and fighting. And telling my story :p",0

I liked how I didn't have to talk much when I worked with printing and slapping the labels onto boxes. I worked alone basically. It was very ideal job, since I was working by myself.

I have always believed that my crippling anxiety was a result of stunted social development during my childhood but my therapist said that I would need to look more deeper into my past to see where exactly it comes from. There is a certain part of my childhood that I dismissed before but now it's coming up again and I don't know what to make of it. When I was a kid (around age 9-12), my cousin, same as my age, forced himself on me on three separate occasions. The first time, he touched me all over my body and forcibly kissed me during the night. The second time, he and some other kids, who I don't remember, pinned me down and tore my pants off. My cousin was the one who told the others to do it. I screamed and cried while they did it. I pleaded with them to stop. I now remember the way they did it so vividly but not what happened before or after. I remember their laughs and the shame that I felt. The third time, he reached into my pants and touched me all night while I was asleep. The next day when we woke up, he proudly told me what he'd done. He even told some other kids. I dismissed it because I was so ashamed to admit. In general, I was afraid of him because he used to bully me. He lived in an another city and used to come around and visit our house during the holidays. I dreaded his arrival so much. I didn't think much about all of this because I thought that we were just fooling around when he did what he did to me, now I feel like it's more sinister. Thinking about it now, makes me so confused and ashamed, why was I so weak to let them do what they did to me? At some level, I don't even know what happened to me. Was I sexually abused as a child? Or am I just making something big out of nothing? Do children even abuse other children? Was I repressing my memories? Is this the reason why I carry the heavy burden of mental health problems on back? I'm 22 now. This burden is pulling me away from becoming the person I want to be and follow my dreams. I push forward but still I wish I wasn't suffering from this.nnI'm sorry for putting this out there but I need some clarity. My therapist had to close down his office due to the outbreak and I didn't have anyone else to discuss this with.

Just questioning everything.nn\*\*nnIt's going to be a very long post and I'm not really sure if this is the right subreddit so pardon me.nnAlso, *short disclaimer*: English is not my first language so there might be grammatical mistakes and inconsistencies with tenses and subjects.nnThe main purpose of this post is to vent, maybe receive some wisdom or find people who feel the same.nn\*\*nnI guess I'll introduce myself first. I'd rather stay nameless. I'm a 19-year-old (M) first year undergraduate Maths student.nnI have never been to therapy or received any kind of diagnosis from a professional, so I'd rather not say I ***have*** social anxiety to avoid criticism. I'll just say that sometimes I get *very* 'anxious' and 'sad'.nnIt's been like this since middle school actually. You know, being Asian in a small Italian town is not very easy. Plus, I'm very introverted and generally shy. Ergo, bullying and discrimination. That obviously affected me severely but here I am 8 years later.nnI haven't learned to cope with anxiety. The effects and consequences are pretty apparent, I would say. That's why in the past decade I haven't been able to socialise or do anything, really. I am just always at home. Oh, well, *was*. Where is *home* anyways now?nnYou know... People always told me ""University will be different! You will make new friends! You can start a whole new life!"" as if anxiety is something I can just switch off or forget about. I did kind of have that expectation when I came here but I also remained realistic so that I wouldn't be disappointed afterwards. You might be wondering why the hell I came all the way to the UK anyways.nnWell, I'm not sure actually, but I 100% regretted that choice. I guess I just didn't want my university choice to be something I would look back at and regret. Moreover, my family has the typical mentality that school is basically your life (i.e. School = Life). So, if you want to succeed you need to go to a good University. I also wanted better opportunities and that kind of things. But my choice ended up being detrimental to my mental health. The first few months were absolutely terrible.nnI lived in an accommodation with 10 other people. You know, the ""social"" in social anxiety stands for something, but certainly not that. I couldn't complain to anyone since my parents don't know anything about my mental health and they're not supportive either. Mental health is sort of a taboo topic. So, I was just like ""Ok, maybe it isn't THAT bad.."". But it kind of was (is). I ended up locking myself in the room. I didn't eat, go to the bathroom (well, only when it was extreme), go outside in general or even attend lectures. The total number of lectures I attended this whole year (2 terms) is 5. I would hand in my worksheets at 3/4AM so that no one would be up. nnAttendance was a huge problem, luckily during the first term I met someone at one of the 5 lectures I attended and bargained with them. I would 'help' them with homework and they would sign me in. That worked out ok. In the second term, they stopped texting me. I was missing lectures and actually received a warning email from my University. I started attending some lectures, but then this whole coronavirus outbreak happened and kind of saved my ass, since online lectures are pre-recorded and attendance is not registered.nnOh, the flatmates 'situation' kind of got better since I moved to another flat with 5 people. Which is still a lot but at least it's halved. The reason my parents said ok that I move was because they noticed I wasn't eating and getting unhealthy. But I still couldn't bring myself to go to the kitchen when I moved here, so I ended up buying an electric pot or something like that, cooked in my room and had constant anxiety that I might trigger the smoke detector. I just kept living like this. Well, now I can go to the kitchen since my flatmates all moved out because of the pandemic and I'm all alone in the flat.nnA lot of people will probably tell me that I should take a gap year and get better mentally or that I'm wasting time and money. I totally understand that. I also agree but it's not something I can really do. It's about my parents, family and traditions. I know that I should put myself first but that's hard to debate on. It's non-negotiable and I do not want to go against or lose my family.nnI also have recently been questioning my major. Whether I really want to study Mathematics. You know, it's been almost a decade since I really felt passionate about something. Since middle school I'd  felt nothing. It had all just been kind of bland and tasteless. Nothing really stood out to me. Maths was the only thing that kind of motivated me to study but at the same time it's one of the main things stressing me out on a daily basis.nnI'm not that good at Maths. Obviously, I know more than average people because if that weren't the case I wouldn't be here in the first place, would I? But I'm not extraordinarily great, you know? I don't mean 'mathematician level' good but like I don't get 90-100% on every paper and exams.nnMoreover, I hate my mathematical proofs. I know that a lot of people might not be able to understand what's wrong with my proofs so let me make an analogy with essay writing (might not be accurate). My proofs are like unnecessarily long essays that try to hit the 2000 words mark, with excessive repetitions, trivial assumptions, grammatical errors and digressions. An essay that ends up making an inconclusive and baseless statement.nnAt least, that's how I feel. I am very insecure about it. Moreover, what bothers me is that even if I get high grades I know that that's because I do it how my professor likes it, not because I'm good. I also don't really have a point of reference to be able to judge myself (I don't have friends of course and can't compare my grades with anyone, so I don't know if I'm average or awful). I feel like I'm not learning at all. I feel very lost and confused. I also can't stay focused at all. Anything will distract me. I never put 100% effort in what I do. It's like 70% at maximum. It's kind of always been like this for me. I don't know why it's so hard for me to dedicate all of my being to something.nnI'm lacking learning techniques and scheduling skills. I don't know how to efficiently approach my study material and how to effectively apply what I learn. I don't know how to be proud of myself either. nnI feel like I'm just always doing the bare minimum to survive.nnPeople who I have vented to when I'm anxious or have an existential crisis always end up suggesting me the same things and trying to comfort me in the same ways (same words and phrases). But if I'm still like this after all these years, it means I have probably already tried it *or* tried, failed and was traumatised by it. I don't blame anyone for saying the same things over and over again. It's just that after some time, hearing the same things is irritating because it's almost like they're implying I haven't tried hard enough or something along those lines.nnAt the same time, since I grew up anxious, 'anxiety' makes up 50% of my personality and character. So I sometimes wonder if I really want to get better at all. Who am I without anxiety? I don't have goals, I live for others. I wouldn't be alive at all if it was for me, to be honest. These last few sentences might not make sense, sorry.nnI apologise for being all over the place. I keep getting distracted and losing my train of thoughts. I hope it all sort of makes sense. nnHave a wonderful day, everyone!",0

I struggle with major depressive disorder and social anxiety. I’m also mentally inadequate for college. I really suck at it. I can’t grasp simple concepts easily. I feel so much pain, guilt, shame, dread, and panic every single day. It’s too much. I just got kicked off my dads insurance, so goodbye to life-saving therapy and medication. The anxiety has gotten worse over the years, to the point where it’s disabling. I can’t go on a job interview because of the anxiety. I can’t even fathom a job interview. Just thinking about it makes me break out into a sweat and makes my heart literally hurt. It feels like someone grabbed my heart and is squeezing it. I can’t even interact with a cashier without being visibly nervous (voice shaking and profusely sweating) I can’t even talk to my stepmom (whom I’m not close with) without being nervous. I dread going upstairs to fix myself a meal because I have to talk to her. I’ve gone days without eating because of this.nnAt this point, the only option is suicide. I’m suffering too much to keep fighting this battle. The depression hurts so fucking bad. I’ve tried everything. My family will be devastated if I do it (I think), but I literally have no other options. I’d rather commit suicide than go on a job interview and have to interact with people at a job all day, everyday. I wish I wasn’t suffering like this and I wish there were other options, but there aren’t.",0

I thought this sub would be most appropriate since I definitely get anxious in certain situations. nnAnyways, right now I’m a junior in high school so I’ve been out of school for the past 3 months. It’s been nice but now that my school year is done I feel like I need something to go. When school is still going on I spend most of my time studying and working on homework alone in my room. But I now feel like I have to purpose and just sit around all day alone. nnI’ve wanted to get a job, volunteer, do something for years but just can’t bring up the courage to do so because I get anxious just thinking about calling someone to ask for more information. My sister that’s two years younger than me is getting a job and here I am at 17 and I don’t have a job, can’t drive, and just feel useless and depressed. nnThis has been effecting me for as long as I can remember. I literally have no friends. Haven’t hung out with someone since 7th grade and my anxiety seems to be getting worse and worse. I’m too anxious to even go on a walk around my neighborhood, or go on a hike in the Forest because I’m worried of seeing people from my school. I even get anxious going out to eat or shopping with my family because I’m always worried about seeing people I know. nnIs it bad that my social anxiety has gotten to a point of influencing everything I do outside of my house? I literally can’t do anything social anymore. I did online school my sophomore year and I feel like everything has just gotten worse since then when I didn’t talk to anybody but my family for over a year. Idk, what do I do? I’m fucking depressed and feel like I’m so much worse than everybody else because I can’t do anything without freaking out and getting extreme anxious.",0
6470,"Amygct","post","Social anxiety and ocd","Hi,nnAlmost every post overhere seems to focused on shyness, so I feel kinda alone in this. If anyone think he or she relate to what I’ve wrote I would be glad to hear. nnCurrently I’m following therapy for my social anxiety and ocd. I’m struggling with this for 4 years and I have very big struggles to leave my house. nnMy ocd is the fear of being a bad (crazy) person. I’m always scanning everything that may can influence me in a negative way. It’s pretty bad where I even fear specific colors. I can’t watch movies, listen to music without being scared. I can’t take medicine, alcohol, caffeine etc as well. I’ve got intrusive thoughts which freaks me out and makes me doubt myself a lot. It’s a 24/7 obsession basically and it’s holding me back a lot. I can’t accept myself at all. nnMy social anxiety is where it basically started and that’s something I’m struggling with for a long time. Ever since I can remember I always was very shy, but I could live with it. My childhood trauma’s made it worse. 4 years ago it became more severe and I couldn’t go to college anymore. At first I could still meet my family and friends, but after 2 years or so that became extremely hard as well. I couldn’t go to grocery stores, trains, parties etc. At first it was especially situations where I couldn’t get out, but last year it became even more severe till a point I can’t imagine it being worse. Right now I can’t take a proper walk without feeling panic. I’m currently in online therapy where I’m planning exposures etc. but I ain’t really improving. For example; I’m taking the bus and train with my mom where I practice with, but it only gets worse actually. Being around people just gives me panic. Unfortunately my social anxiety also is happening with the people I live with. It’s horrible. I’m not sure what to do about this. I probably just need to make conversation, but I’m just so super afraid of it. I  am afraid I can’t hold a conversation. My ocd makes things a lot worse. I also experience derealization which is a tough thing as well. I’m always feeling out of place and if there is something terribly wrong with me. Everything just feels super overwhelming a lot of times. I’m just super insecure about myself. nnAny advice? I’m not sure how to continue and I start to get more and more depressed.",1

6476,"Responsible_Hedgehog","post","Social anxiety, love and emotional baggage","Hi! nnI've been struggling with this for a while. I have social anxiety disorder and have gone to therapy about 3 years now. My social anxiety is rooted mostly from childhood experiences and severe bullying during school years. During high school I also suffered from severe depression (luckily i got to therapy + medication quite fast since doctors thought that my situation was urgent). So even though I have quite a lot of baggage, I'm doing very well. I'm about to graduate with good grades and despite having social anxiety I have managed to be active in different extracurricular activities. I have even attended singing classes for 2 years now as a self-therapeutic method. The only thing I yet haven't had has been is a loving relationship. I have never dated or been in a relationship. I'm 25 and still virgin. Never kissed anyone. I'm gay.nnThe situation is that I have had a crush with a guy - or I can honestly say that I may be fallen in love with him. It's definitely more than a crush. We are definitely friends but my social anxiety gives me headache in a way that I do a lot to somehow be close to that person, but the same time my social anxiety makes me avoidant in many ways. nnFor the longest time I doubted if he would be interested since I don't really know if he is gay or bi or something else. Even i'm not fully out. Since my background of severe bullying I don't trust easily. I'm not used for people being interested in me in a positive way. I thought that he is just being a overly friendly person.nnI asked from friends who have more experience of relationships and they said that the signals he gave were clear signs of interest towards me. For example he invited me to activities, to drink coffee and even I managed to muster enough courage to invite him to coffee, birthday dinner (he even bought me a present &gt; i didnt ask). He showed that he cared about my emotional wellbeing (I had project that failed big time). And the support was a bit different of what my few but close friends gave me.nnThrough our discussion i have noticed that we have similar backgrounds and values. He has given me positive feedback (sometimes too much I think). He has praised me to other people too. And he acts in a way that in my opinion (with my non experience of relationships) may be signs that he could be interested in me too. He sometimes gives me those glances and might also smile to me. nnSo is this something? In retrospect he has maybe given hints that I haven't noticed or maybe communicated the message bit ambiguously and in a way that the ball would have been in my hands. For example after the birthday dinner he said that he would gladly visit second time. Also once we talked about where we both lived and he said that I would be welcome to visit him sometime. And at the time it didn't register to me that it would have been in my hands to do something about it. At the time I thought he was just being polite, he doesn't really want it.nnThe thing is that we haven't really even actively brought up the matter, if there is something or not. So i might also be wrong.nnDuring this spring/summer and because of corona I have had more anxiety which has ment more avoidance and anxiety attacks. And I haven't seen him physically for months (and haven't had the confidence to ask him for us to meet or do something even if we live in the same city), although we talk in whatsapp almost weekly.nnThe thing is that I was planning to go study abroad as an exchange student for my last year of studies but corona kinda messed up my plans. And I planned to tell him about my feelings via whatsapp before I leave (yes im a coward). But since my plans got cancelled my last year will continue normally. And i'm doubting that should I tell him or not. We will most likely see during fall, but since he is graduating it is not 100% sure. nnThis feeling gives me a lot of anxiety even though it should feel good. It gives me anxiety attacks. Im not that scared of rejection, but more of losing his friendship and awkwardness. Because of my background I have issues with my self-image and even though outwards I may seem student that is thriving, I tend to feel that im hard to love or unlovable. Im afraid to really show my true self in case if he or someone else doesn't like what he sees and that shows that me feeling unlovable is true. I also have a tendency to think that I need to fix my mental health problems before I can give myself a permission to let love in. Even though I have been going to therapy for a long time (3 years for depression, 3 for social anxiety) I feel im not fully healed yet - i still have things that are very hard to talk about, even in therapy. I think that the biggest fear is if im ridiculed or if i will get bullied again because of my feelings. I also don't like how social anxiety disorder affects my behavior and in possible relationship I would feel like I was a burden because of it. Since social anxiety makes me very self-conscious I'm also very insecure about my looks. This too goes back to bullying since I was bullied also because of my looks (i was an ugly duckling from a low income family). Now rationally i know that I look ok/normal - sometimes even attractive, but social anxiety tells me otherwise. For example at the moment im too self-conscious to even thinking to have sex (i tend to feel its dirty).nnnSoooo.....what do you think? What should I do?nnSorry for the long post!nnThank you",1

I know it's all pretty irrational but you know how it is with SAD lolnnStill, back in high school I didn't think I'd ever get to this point.

I feel she (a woman with a psychology degree and career in behavioral therapy for the severely disabled) wants me to be isolated from people so she can control the way I think, feel and act.  I think that she’s been enabled by the pharmaceutical companies and corrupt doctors , psychiatrists.  Anybody else have adhd as well? Maybe abusive parents or is it possible that you experienced trauma early on in life that made us this way? People love to blame victims rather than get to the root of the problem and I’m starting to believe there is a really big issue with the way we diagnose and treat people with mental health problems. It’s starting to seem like gaslighting on a larger scheme. Any input or experiences welcome.",0

As stated in the title, I don't know if this is appropriate here, but I feel truly helpless. I have made five or so Reddit accounts in less than a year, all of which I have deleted out of frustration. However, I would very much like this time to be different. nnMy name is Lilly, and I'm 20 years old. I currently go to university, but I've been noticed by no one. Then again, though, I'm far too nervous to engage in anything with anyone. I would say my social anxiety disorder is pretty...extreme; basic interactions are incredibly difficult for me, and I haven't had a ""friend"" in nearly five years. When I did have friends, however, they always left me for someone else. I was never active enough in my friendships, and I made absolutely no effort to initiate anything with them. I've been dubbed ""cold,"" ""distant,"" and ""bitchy"" by many, and for good reason, because I bear the semblance of someone who despises the world when in reality, I want more than anything to be cared about by someone. I don't enjoy becoming close to others, and I don't know why. As soon as someone shows signs of attachment, I'm the embodiment of that ""disappearing black dude"" meme. Lol. When I discovered methods of online friendship, though, I became very happy. I enjoy the distance and space immensely. I'm a gamer and have had many encounters with others online (PS4 if anyone cares), which was nice because it made me feel acknowledged for just a moment. People in real life don't care for me, but I get to show myself fully online, and I have been widely accepted. However, everyone I meet doesn't face my struggle and already possesses a group of people with whom they can communicate and cherish. I want someone like me.nnI want someone who has no one. I want someone who wants to help and be helped. I want someone to relate to, but at the same time talk about anything besides social anxiety. You know who my best friends are? My parents. You can imagine why I'd want other people in my life, I'd like to think. I'd really prefer if you're a dude 'cause I just don't really care to have female friends. I know I'm generalising, but I just have better chemistry with guys and don't have to worry about being judged for the things I like to do. I'd also like if you were 20-22, at least, because I truly just want a peer. nnIf you have the following interests, PLEASE, please come my way! I'm a singer, musician (piano, guitar, whatever else), and writer (sci-fi and fantasy, mostly). I love music more than anything, whether it be listening to or creating it. My favourite group/band is The Midnight. They're a synthwave group, which is one of my favourite genres of music. I'm a huuuuuge EDM fan in general, though. It's obvious already, but I am extremely shy and really don't enjoy verbal communication. I have a very restricted range of interests, so I may talk to you if you share some of them. I'm a gamer as I stated above, and I have a PS4 and Steam, so if you're a gamer, too, that'd be epic. I enjoy talking about anything despite always being the ""quiet one."" nnI don't want someone who just comes to me and treats me like an emotional sponge. If I have to hear about you, then please be willing to hear about me. I value being kind above all else, so I truly want to just light up somebody's day. However, I'm so used to this aspect of my character being taken advantage of, and I'm trying to not let that happen anymore. I want someone my age who is all-around an interesting, cool, and nice person. It's been really shitty being lonely all the time, and I just want someone who feels that way, too. I really look forward to having you, and thank you to whoever read this. I just want a best friend.nnP.S. - Sorry, I know my username is cringey, but I just really love techno.

I feel like people find me very annoying and I never initiate a conversatoin. I don't know how to act in social situations and try to mimick people a lot of the time, definitely if it concerns anything that has to do with emotions (i.e. someone is suicidal, family death, is depressed, etc..). I feel like such a terrible person and a horrible example for my little sister, who seems to mimick some things from me. I want to teach her how to be a strong person, while not being strong myself. Everytime I 'fail' in a social situation by not standing up for myself in front of my sister, I feel like slitting my throat. I feel like a failure and that I should just die.  I want to be a strong person and I try to fake this, but somehow I can't. nnI try to distance myself from people and emotions, so they can't hurt me. This started in 5th grade when one of my only friends told me that she didn't want to be friends anymore. This has been resolved since, but eversince I have kept my relationships superficial (also for the fact that my father is very controlling and told me that the world is a scary place etc..).    nEvery social interaction I analyse and I think about what I should have done. I cringe so goddamn much. These things aren't even THAT embarrassing if someone else would do it, but I feel like a failure. These 'cringe memories' first started at night only, but have evolved into reliving these moments  during daytime. A lot of the time I try to relieve the feeling by having some kind of tick (shaking my head or arms, squinting my eyes very hard or clicking with my fingers) or imagining hurting myself quite violently (slitting my throat or chocking myself to death and mimicking these motions with my hands, while not really doing it obviously). nnI have never told anyone this and feel like a pussy tbh.

6500,"mkmkmk420","post","What is social anxiety and how do you 'fix' it","The purpose of this post is to help you all gain some clarity on what you're dealing with and where it stems from, along with showing you that it's possible to overcome and hoping to inspire you not to give up. I'm not an expert, however I have a lot of experience with dealing with this. Hope it helps. nnThis is probably what your issues feel like to you. Always scenarios of where you think you messed up playing in your head. The questions 'why can't I just not have these thoughts and feel normal' and 'what's wrong with me keep playing'. I'm sure you've tried to tackle the anxiety head on, tried to just rationalize it in your heads so you won't deal with it and maybe even tried cold approaches and forcing difficult situations. If you ask people what to do, they'll say just talk to people, no one cares about these things and no ones judging you. YOU KNOW NO ONES JUDGING YOU, YOU JUST CAN'T CONVINCE YOUR MIND OF THAT. YOU DO TRY TALKING TO PEOPLE BUT YOU ALWAYS EITHER CANT KEEP UP OR MESS UP AND SOMETIMES IT DOES FEEL LIKE OTHERS ARE JUDGING YOU. You might have ended up feeling helpless and just decided, I guess it is what it is. Except it isn't. nnAnxiety alone is sorta like a defence mechanism. When some things are worrying you too much and aren't addressed, anxiety comes in as a mask to try and distract you. You've lost control so you try gaining it in your thoughts, but that just means you're tryna work on the distraction, not the underlying issues. Social anxiety is similar, except the anxiety acts primarily on social situations. While talking to people, you care what they're thinking of you, and this develops a fear of judgement of any sort from those around you. Hence, you're always thinking, tryna see how others are reacting and analyzing their every move. You get into a state of fight or flight because you have pressure now not to mess up. What does that pressure do? Often makes you mess up. So that happens, you later think about it, and cringe. You question why you're like this, why aren't you good enough. Hold up though. Where did this assumption that youre not good enough start from. Surely you didn't just start thinking it one day. Isn't it probable that something or some things in the past reinforced this self limiting belief on you? And now you treat it just like a fact? Maybe your own self doubt is something worth addressing here. nnHence, two of the things that matter a lot in the road to recovery are hidden worries and self limiting beliefs. Think about what things in life you've lost control of and are making you upset. What's stopping you from gaining control of them. Is it true that you can't do anything at all in them? Or can you do little things to gain more control in them. If you can't do more than what you've done, haven't you done your part. Isn't it true that worrying about your lack of control won't change the situation at all and only adversely affect your mental health? Also, where'd this assumption come from? Who reinforced it? Is it truly accurate? If not, why not? nnThese are thinks worth thinking about. I believe they could give you a lot more direction and progress. I'm a person who's faced and overcome severe depression, anxiety, and social anxiety, these are some of the things that helped me. I'm not a licensed therapist, simply someone who's got life experience, and as a social anxiety coach I help people achieve similar results. I truly hope this posts helps some of you, Im genuinely passionate about helping others who are where I was. If you'd like some more value or help, shoot a comment below or better yet, feel free to dm me. I love helping as I said,  so don't hesitate!",0

Being anxious in social situations is not normal. Be sure you are treated for the right condition.nnIn the mental health institution I was forced to take meds. I was put on an antipsychotic called abilify. At first my anxiety skyrocketed and I nearly shitted myself literally which was a horrible experience. But after my dosis was dramatically reduced a wonder happened. My social anxiety disappeared. Completely. I don't have an ounce of social anxiety anymore. I don't know about you, but my anxiety did never respond to logic and reason. So here is my second tip for you: Don't neglect meds. They are completely neglected on this sub, but there might be something out there for you that you can take your whole life and make your social anxiety disappear. Especially if you don't have autism like me this might be a solution to all your suffering. nnI am definetly not doing well and I struggle a lot with social interaction. But that is not due to anxiety, but I just don't know what to say and I am very quiet. But please for you guys, if you are suffering, try out meds. I was afraid to take them for a long time, but they can really be your friend",1

6510,"ChinitoFlacito","post","I don’t know what I am.","Hello reddit. I’ve never ever been diagnosed by a professional but I’m 100% sure I have a problem. I don’t know what it is. I’ve searched and researched throughout the years and they all lead to social anxiety or general anxiety. I’m 17 about to enter my senior year of high school. As a kid I had no problem making friends or having conversations even if I was a bit weird. I’ve had a pretty good/bad childhood. I know where my anxiety stems from. I hate shifting the blame towards him but my father was extremely diminishing when it came to me as a child. I played soccer. My dad would always compare me to others. He would call me useless, curse at me, in front of the other parents and kids. He would often scream at me for simple things like dropping a grain of rice on the floor and telling me to eat it from the floor. My mom and him fought a lot because my mom knew that what he was doing and she wanted him to stop. Just yesterday I went to soccer practice after 3 months of the virus and I couldn’t stop trembling. I could feel my heart in my chest beating really fast as we got closer to the field. Also I have a really close relationship with my mom because she’s never made me feel insecure about myself and she’s very pure and innocent in my eyes. I work part time in the company she’s worked in for 11 years and she’s just the most hardworking woman I’ve ever seen. Thank you Mom. Another thing to mention is that my dad is an alcoholic and his friends are too. They’re not the type of friends I would have. Think of the typical cocky fuck boys in HS. All that went on for years until I reached adolescence. He stopped criticizing me in sports, etc. But he would still get easily irritable with small things. Over the years our relationship got worse and worse. Especially his relationship with my mom. It all started 8th grade when I started becoming self conscious about myself. I’m also very skinny so I received a lot of body shaming growing up to the point where I don’t even care what my body looks like anymore. But I would recognize that the music I listened to, or things I did past or present were “cringy” and not something the crowd would do. I left middle school with 4.0 GPA and I was pretty committed to my grades. Anyways freshman year of hs wasn’t bad but I began to realize that I get scared of talking to people sometimes, and that I get easily irritated or mad over small things. Sophomore year was a hell hole. I became close friends with a girl I liked. She gave me a ton of mixed feelings and I ended up embarrassing myself because of it. A lot of guys in the city try to hit up on her. I saw her differently than everybody else though. I felt like I could be myself with her. But anyways we’re no longer friends. From then on it went downhill. I started to become self conscious about little things. It was like the more I started to think the more self conscious I became. I became self conscious about the way I walked. Stupid I know. I even became self conscious about the way I ate, or held a spoon/fork/knife etc. I started to view the world differently. I started researching physiological reasons as to why people did the things they did or why people act the way they do. And that was for everything, from society, to their likes and dislikes, to the way their brain is wired. I started to lose my friends because I was weird, and I became self conscious about it. Freshman year my friend called me “annoying” really loud in the gym. I was embarrassed. I stopped talking and I started filtering everything I said to the point where I don’t talk to anybody anymore. I lost all my friends. My grades dropped. I now have a 2.7 GPA. I’m scared of doing simple things like going to the barbershop because I don’t know where to look, or how to make conversation and I’m scared of getting embarrassed or even using “barbershop” terms to let the barber know what I want. (Meanwhile everybody else is dreading to go) Plus most of the shops in my area are Spanish. Although it’s my 2nd language I get self conscious about not being able to speak it fluently. I spend most of my time in my room. I despise talking to people because it’s a chore for me. The only person I feel comfortable around talking is my mother. Also another thing I do is that I fixate on really embarrassing moments of my life even when they occurred months or even years in the past. And then my self esteem always lowers because of it. Some things I really enjoy are skating and story games. I managed to make like 2 friends recently and they’re really cool people just from skating! Anyways I usually see people as machines conforming to society with problems behind the curtain of school, parties, hangouts, etc. Nobody has invited me to parties, or hangouts since middle school. I probably wouldn’t even want to go because I wouldn’t know how to act or be like. Embarrassment is my biggest fear. Throughout my junior year I became self conscious about every minute detail of not only my life but the life of others. I’ve managed to figure out what I want to do when I’m older. I want to become an aerospace engineer but I really messed up high school and it’s going to take a lot of hard work in college. Sometimes I get really depressed and think about a life where I didn’t have anxiety or anything or anyone that would cause me anxiety. I hate the fact that our world has many different morals. It’s both a good and bad thing. A hoodlum from the “hood” would care less if a 5 year old got in the crossfire of a drive by shooting. Someone like myself can’t even see myself critiquing another human being. That’s also a thing I can’t do. I can’t criticize anybody or be critiqued because I get so self conscious. For them and for myself. Anyways I really don’t know who I am because I’m always conforming to society. I barely even know my own likes or dislikes. I hate myself and this unjust world. I don’t know what is wrong with me. I’m sorry I wrote so much. If you got through it all thank you. It means a lot. And I don’t know if this is something every teenager feels or if something is wrong with me. I just wish everyday wasn’t a constant struggle with my own head. I’m writing this tempting to delete it because I wrote too much and half of the stuff would just fly by over heads.",0

My thoughts are all over the place so I'd understand if some things I write arent that clear.nnWhen I was 10 I moved from Brazil to Germany with my parents. I had always been a shy child but after moving to another country it only got worse. Ive made a few friends during the last 6 years, but dont have contact with any of them anymore. 3 years ago, when I was 13, I moved to another school where certain things happened that lead me into developing social anxiety and depression. I barely went/go out apart of when I needed/need to go to school. I pretty much didnt/dont talk at all in school unless somebody asked/asks me something. Due to pretty much not raising my hand at all, my oral grades have been pretty bad. This lead to my parents eventually taking me to a therapist. I started seeing her last year and since 3 weeks ago Ive been taking antidepressants. nnLast year, a friend of mine from Brazil died. Although I felt sad and have been thinking about him pretty much every day since his death, I only cried once. I feel like im so emotionally detached from everyone around me and specially myself. A few weeks later I started cutting myself. It started like something small but yesterday I cut myself again. I It resulted in even larger cuts then before. Ive tried to hide them but today my mother found out about them. She promised me she wont tell it to my father because hes busy a lot of time with his work and he doesnt need more problems to deal with. She told me she wants me to tell it to my therapist though.nnI dont know exactly what would happen if I told her everything, but I suppose she wouldn't send me to a clinic right away.

I am a junior in high school and soon I will be 17. what if all my life ever equates to is failed attempts at social interactions? What if I never experience deep and meaningful friendships that I carry with me for a lifetime? I haven’t had a friend since I was 12. It‘s not that I get bullied. My peers treat me normally, but I have the hardest time being vulnerable. I know that friendship, when basically analyzed is a swapping of information. You share intimate details with someone else, and in that way your platonic relationship feels, and is different than the ones you share with random people or acquaintances. But, I can’t seem to commit myself to that. My lack of vulnerability with others leads them to get bored of me, and I completely understand. It is my fault, not theirs. nnI used to attend therapy a year ago, but stopped. After 3 sessions I quit. It’s not because I didn’t like my therapist. They were very kind and I actually liked them. But, the truth is I lied. I lied to save myself perceived embarrassment. I lied about how I want to kill myself. I downplayed my morbid thoughts about death. I downplayed my social anxiety, and how much it does interfere with my relationships and day to day life. Therapy became a game of, ""let’s show the therapist I am ""normal"" and don’t need therapy."" nnI have never had those hallmark teenage rites of passage. And I know it is stupid to get caught up in these, but I want it so badly. I want to feel normal. I would rather peak in Highschool knowing that I collected all the teenage rites of passage.

This message I sent to the guy from Tumblr was my first attempt at talking to a friend in years.   nMy wife doesn't have any friends either, mostly because she is also boring and for our young age all we do is stay at home and manage our monthly budget so nobody wants to spend time with us. She invited a friend over months ago for some board games at our place and when we invited her again she never came. She also left in a hurry and I do not believe her when she said she had to babysit ASAP.  nWe literally do not have anyone to list as an emergency contact. We have nobody. My wife's family doesn't care about her. I only have my mother who lives in Europe.   nWhen I was in uni I decided to try to better my situation and went to a psychologist, a psychiatrist and when those didn't help, I managed to find a group for social anxiety sufferers. I barely made it to each meeting and when I was there I was shaking and nauseated the whole time, didn't participate in most of the challenges like reading out loud.

They're really nice to me but I'm tired of their little comments that make me feel like I'm some weird creature that will never belong or fit in. I'm a really good person but some people just can't see past my social anxiety. My efforts go unnoticed because of my social anxiety. Sometimes I feel like I'll never be enough for people that crave physical/emotional connection/intimacy by basing it off words and actually being physically there.nnAlso, my mom's family tortured me as a kid at every family function. I wasn't affectionate. I could not stand hugs and kisses, yet they'd always chase me, hold me down, to kiss and hug me and then laugh at me and say I need to stop being like that and that they hope I grow out of it. I honestly think that's what made my social anxiety worse. And I always wondered would I have been any different had they not tortured me like that.nnI'm a mentally strong person so I'll be ok but I just wanted to get this off my chest in a place where I feel that I belong, and that I am accepted, and have people to relate to.",0

I live at the end of a street so if I drive I have to pass the houses all the way down to the end of the street. It’s crazy because my dad got me a truck just so I can try and leave . I JUST CANT .  If someone were to knock on the door I can’t answer it , if I get a phone call my heart drops and I can feel a panic attack .. over a phone call . And I never answer it .

Will be relaxed, reading something on my phone, or if waiting in line staring ahead while slowly shifting my gaze. Literally every time I'll either look up from phone or to the side and see someone staring at me. I'm not wearing anything provocative or doing anything offensive. And I know the person is judging me, analyzing my face, trying to figure out how smart I am, what I am thinking, what I do for my job, etc. I do not understand how normal people deal with this, it drives me insane. What makes me even more frustrated is reading online that people that do this enjoy making other people uncomfortable and even get off on it. I feel like there is literally no negotiating this via exposure therapy. The knowledge that this can happen to you will always be there, like a constant fear in the back of your mind. What do you guys think? Is there any way to avoid these thoughts?",0

My mother is diagnosed with depression and anxiety but you’d figure she would understand how I feel right? NO! she tells me to “grow up”, “stop acting like a child”, “get over it”, “Not a big deal”, “You have mental illness”.... I love my mother to death but it’s hard when she says these things and claim to know the real me. nMy anxiety is really bad, it has stopped so much opportunities for me, made situations more embarrassing than it has to be, and caused panic attacks.n— Here’s examples of what I have trouble with!n- Scared/nervous to cross the street by myself n- Nervous to talk on the phone n- Nervous at ordering my own foodn- I get anxiety just standing in crowds n- I get really anxious when I have to talk to people I don’t know n- I Hate public speaking n-Scared go in stores I’ve never been in by myself nn All these situations and more is just crushing me slowly. My brain just feels so exhausted because everyday I am being tested with my anxiety. I have to mentally and physically prepare myself for every situation! I had a zoom call today for my college and I had to speak.... my voice was so shaky, my hands were trembling, felt like I was gonna cry any moment. After that I had to legit get up and cool down and talk myself down from embarrassment. I’m 18 yet I can barely do things for myself and I have no support either... everyone around me doesn’t understand and just tells me to grow up. nn- Since I was 12 I’ve been dealing with this on my own and I’d cry every single night wondering if I could ever be normal.... well I’m about to start college and I just feel like dying! And not to be suicidal but I’ve had thoughts for years but that combined with anxiety, depression and everything is just really weighing down on me. nn[And I can’t talk about this to a therapist either because I just don’t trust them and it’s already hard for me to talk to people, let alone tell a complete stranger in person my problems. And like I said, I can’t tell my family because they’re gonna think I have mental issues and send me to a hospital! -.-] nn: So if anyone can relate or has any tips/advice on how you can treat your own anxiety then please let me know.

It started bad in school thru presentations but I’ve realized now I have progressed to be so bad that I’ve even lost a lot of interest literally hanging out with anyone, and feel as if I have no idea how to make any new friends. I used to be the super enthusiastic and happy “crackhead” energy kinda friend that everyone wanted to be around. Now I feel drained and I overthink social situations so much it is honestly exhausting. It’s why I don’t want to do anything anymore. Every small thing someone does (that may be innocent ig) , I will overthink and twist in my head to make the person be against me, like I’m extremely over sensitive or smth. Its to the point where I’ll be somewhere and genuinely don’t know what to say In a situation/conversation. Like I freeze out of fear , or do I just not care? I honestly can’t even tell. The most f’ed up part is after a lot of research I think I may have autism or aspergers. Social situations hav never been easy and I’ve always felt kinda “different” compared to others. Honestly I just don’t know tho. I’m wondering if anyone can possibly relate and lmk what they think of this?? It’s honestly ruined my life so far cause naturally I want to be social so bad but I constantly am thinking of how I’m weird to literally EVERYONE 24/7 (seriously). I was diagnosed w anxiety and depression and have been taking medication lately. It helps a little but still socially I feel like I literally am so off. Also side note: I tried taking adderall in college and it made me much more confident and ready to be social. I read that adderall works for ppl with autism, so this Is why I’m wondering if I have it.",1

6545,"ZookeepergameNo9674","post","Social Anxiety has affected every aspect of my life","Hi to whoever is reading this, I just want to rant because I feel so hopeless and emotionally exhausted. nnEver since I was little, my relationship with my family has always been distant. My relationship with my dad is super awkward that even small talk is intense, so we try to avoid each other in the house sometimes. It has always been like that all my life. With my mother, she doesn't understand boundaries and we have opposing views and beliefs. She's an extremist Christian while religion has no importance in my life. She always brings up religion, not only with me, but with my entire extended family and even strangers. Honestly, it just gets so annoying because you just want to have a normal conversation. She has this obsession to try to change people, and my family stopped visiting her because of that. Next, my sister (she's only a year younger than me) is a very toxic person. She is emotionally abusive to others (even my own mom), and she is very cold-hearted. Everytime you try to have a serious conversation with her, she takes EVERYTHING personally and tries to get revenge if she feel threatened. My relationship with my sister has never been great, her temper gets the best out of her. When we were in middle school all the way to graduation of high school, we wouldn't talk to each other in the house, and this went on for MANY MANY YEARS over the stupidest shit. Now, me and my sister talk because I decided to be the bigger person and apologize to her, but she is still one big bitch who says she christian but her actions and words contradict. Her best friend who she knew MANY MANY years realized how toxic she was and decided to leave the friendship (she's still my friend and we still keep in touch from time to time). My sister and my mom always criticize me and treat me different just because I am not a devoted christian like they are. I know they love me, but they really do think I'm really stupid or something by making me feel less of a person. I truly believe that I am the black sheep in my family. **Throughout my entire life, I've been living in solitude, and this has affected my ability to build friendships and romantic relationships.** nnI noticed that at my community college and part-time jobs, I really struggled to make friends with my classmates. I knew a lot of people, but they weren't really people who would invite me to hang out outside school or work. After I have finished community college and transferred to a 4-year university in 2018, I remember thinking to myself that this would be my only ticket to get out of my house and finally start a new chapter in my life. I thought I would make friends and finally have a great college experience since I was bullied from elementary school all the way to high school. After moving, the same thing keeps occuring while I'm working on campus and in my classes. I feel more alone than ever. I went to the psychiatric hospital three times. I remember I called off work because I was way too depressed to get out of bed. I had a panic attack when I was walking to my professor's office to get help on my homework. I feel that nobody likes me. I say this because people try to avoid me after meeting me and give me such awkward looks. For example, I remember I met a girl at a job on campus. I thought we were cool and we hit it off, but suddenly after 3 months, she started to avoid me at work. Another colleague I thought we were really cool with each other unfollowed me on IG, but he followed everyone else from work. It was super weird. I don't know what I did. I remember I would help him out in classes (we were in the same class) and sometimes give him rides to places. I remember I would check in to see how he was doing. I felt like I'm a super nice person and a great friend. Even during college, I would join clubs, but people would turn me down all the time. **There's this pattern that keeps happening that everytime I meet people, they just end up not liking me.** I don't know what I am doing wrong. People don't tell me, they just ghost me for no reason. As a result, my social anxiety has really skyrocketed. Now that I am only a few months from graduating, I getting anxious to find work and my self-esteem has hit rock bottom. I am disappointed that I had a such a shitty experience throughout my entire education and didn't get to live my life to the fullest. I was watching everyone else have the time of their lives. **I can't believe that I am 24 years old and I can't make friends. Social anxiety has affected every aspect of my life and have developed poor social skills.** I really do have abandonment and trust issues now. nnI have gone to individual therapy, MBT, a residential program and group therapy. I talk about this to my therapist all the time, but I feel like she's getting tired of it, so I stopped going to therapy. I just want to overcome this, but I don't know how to even begin practicing or know what the hell am I doing wrong. I feel so lost and hopeless. All I want in life is to have friends. I'm such a fucking loser. I really don't see the point of life anymore.",1
6546,"TheEmblaze","post","Extremely scared of my peers","Im 18 and i have social anxiety and selective mutism, I think in the past year I've pushed past a lot of the boundaries that come with my selective mutism but one remnant from my elementary/middle school days is my irrational fear of anyone who happens to be the same age as me, but more-so, people who, at a glance seem like they could be part of my social circle.nnI was biking yesterday and saw a 😎😎😎 group of teenagers, it was super hot and id just come from a pretty challenging route. No sweat. I was practically and calm dry, until I saw them. There was a 0% chance that they'd even come near me but I still reacted with such intense fear, I think it literally activates my flight or fight.nnI have pretty bad social anxiety in general but teens are where it fucks me up disproportionately nna little about my life: not really necessary to understand my point.nnI'm Nigerian but i grew up in Canada, lived here until 4th grade and my social life was pretty pleasant, even with a bad case of selective mutism while at school, had a decent amount of friends and I was treated pretty nicely. Outside of school, I was much more socially active, I had great relationships with my parents friends kids, who were other Nigerians in my city. my school friends were more like who you'd picture in suburban canada, though. I moved back to Canada last year for boarding school and I go back to nigeria for holidays. nnWhen I moved to Nigeria, it was really unexpected, no one in my family planned it, my mother has schizophrenia and on a whim, on the last day of our vacation there she decided to skip our return flight and settle down with my dad, who before that point lived there for working visited us in canada a few times a year, it was super hard being ripped away from my old life and friends without warning and it made my selective mutism a lot worse. I was 9 years old and I think at that time you're bound to be going through a lot of growing up. nnI don't want anyone to feel super sorry for me for moving to a third world country or whatever, I was lucky enough to live a lifestyle that shielded me from the whole ""third world"" aspect, I went to good schools and had a good time, if we ignore my school experiences. I was definitely scared of the idea of living there though lol nnMy selective mutism seemed to get a lot worse as I started fourth grade, on the first day of school I went through a huge wave of culture shock and cried my eyes out when I was asked to read aloud in class, so, that really gave everyone a shitty impression of me, I still remember it so vividly, 9 years  later. The kids in nigeria were a lot less receptive to ""different"" people like me and that vibe stretched all the way to the people I met in high school. I wouldn't say I was bullied (I was physically bigger than pretty much everyone) but I was singled out and made fun of a lot for being the guy who ""never talked"" because the culture over there is like, boys are supposed to be outgoing and loud, and the pushback for being anything else is pretty harsh. never really had anyone reach out and try to be my friend. By the time I left that school after 6th grade my impression of Nigerian kids was that they were just plain mean. back then I had hope that id move back home ""any moment now"" and it wouldn't have to be a big problem much longer.nnPeople were nicer in my new school, but I kept to myself and was very anti social for the first year because of the impression that the old school had on me. Later I started getting closer to people , I wouldn't say I had friends throughout secondary school but I began to see the good in a lot of people around me. My selective mutism made me unable to talk to people at school but that's a whole different story.nnWhen I moved back here last summer I went to an International school. before I moved to nigeria I identified as Canadian but living in nigeria for 8 years made me 180, so when I first got to my new school I only gravitated towards Nigerians. I thought i'd gotten so past my SM that id be able to act like I never had it, but when I tried to get myself into a group, or talk to one person I felt such crazy anxiety, I went to my therapist and I started taking medication for anxiety. I had a math class where me and three other Nigerians sat together and this one girl reminded me a lot of the people I was around in secondary school; a good, cool person, but what I went through really gave me what I can only call the opposite of a god complex, I really felt like I wasn't worth enough to even be around such a person, I could barely focus in that class. I never have panic attacks but every class was the closest thing I had to one. I didn't know. why I felt like this, though, until last December, when I went home for Christmas and I was having a conversation with an internet friend; I finally cracked one of my biggest mysteries: the title of this post. nnLmao im so sorry if these paragraphs felt unneeded I just really like to talk about my life :/nnMy fear of my peers isn't equal across the board; its much worse for nigerians who are whatever age I happen to be, online and in real life. its still bad with everyone else but that just makes it much worse. I guess im super scared that they'll ridicule me for my social ineptitude and niche interests or whatever. I felt so good when I discovered it but I really dont know what to do with this information, I've been struggling all year. I know it was caused by my elementary school experience but idk how to reconcile it or if I even have to. nnsorry if I wasn't clear im happy to clarify more",1

Don't worry.* nnOkay so let me start by saying that I haven't been diagnosed with social anxiety or even talked to any professional about it. There are different reasons behind that, partly that I have this fear that my problems aren't ""bad enough"" and people and professionals will judge and ridicule me in different ways and think I'm just making things up. I hope it's still okay that I post here, but if not I'll delete my post. I'll be explaining some of my ""problems"" at first but if it's too long to read I guess you can skip to the bold text further down. nn&amp;#x200B;nn*  I often ""freeze"" in social situations (mostly with strangers but occasionally with people I know too) to the point where I can barely talk. People often think I'm rude or hate them when they meet me. n*  I focus so much on how I'm perceived and what others think of me. It can be everything from how much eye contact I should be giving someone to what I'm wearing or how I'm performing a task. n* I struggled on my previous job because of this. I worked as a substitute teacher at different daycare centers in my area and got called in when a teacher was sick or so. Every time there was another adult in the same room as me, I could barely talk to the kids. Sometimes the kids were fighting and  screaming, but I was froze and couldn't do anything about it, so another adult had to handle it. This made me feel so embarrassed and worthless.. Whenever I was alone with the kids though, I could do the job pretty well. It was just that I was so afraid that the other adults looked at me and saw all the things I was doing wrong and thought I was doing my job poorly. I called  in sick a few times because I spent the whole night or morning before work crying uncontrollably because I knew what was waiting for me at work. nn**Now I'm gonna proceed to the thing that I wanted to ask about**. I'm 19 years old and currently trying to figure out what to study at university. I still feel very lost, but my brain keeps coming back to a few career paths that I find interesting. There's only one problem: All of them are pretty social professions that would require constant social contact. A few examples of them are: ,Nurse, doctor, psychologist, dentist and teacher. nnWhenever I read about different career paths, I always come back to these kind of jobs. I guess that means I'm interested in them, but I'm just so scared of things ending badly. What if I study for 4 years and start working just to realize that I get paralyzed with anxiety most days and can't do my job properly? I'm really scared. Is it possible to get over social anxiety (if that's what I have) or should I accept that these careers aren't suitable for me? :(",0

We were parked on top of a mountain looking over a city when a Blue Tesla suddenly parked next to us. We saw it before when we were driving around the mountain but we never saw the owner and my sister was saying how much she loved the car. I joked around and said “One of us should just go up and say ‘hey I like your car’” my sister took that as a chance to annoy me and started teasing me saying I should do it and that I would never. Me being the annoying little sibling took that as a challenge so I put on my mask and got out of the car (not going to lie I was walking back and forth between our two cars for ten minutes because I just realized what I got myself into).nnMy sister was recording as her and her friend were laughing so then I finally did it I walked up to the car and saw this really beautiful lady in the drivers side. I knocked on the window and said “hey my friends and I thought u had a really cool car and I also think you’re really cute and cool so uh yeah” (I get word vomit when trying to initiate a conversation which I rarely do). Turns out the lady actually WORKED for Tesla so she offered all three of us a little joy ride up and down the mountain, we even got to see some really cool stuff like how they have a “romance” setting where it shows a fireplace on the screen and the AC suddenly turns to heat as ur seat starts to warm up. It was just like sitting next to a fire! THEY ALSO HAD A WHOOPIE CUSHION SETTING THAT U COULD PASS AROUND TO EACH SEAT AND CHANGE WHAT FART SOUND COMES OUT OF IT. It was super cool and since I was the one who went up to her I got to ride in the front seat which I NEVER get to do because of my sisters friends and stuff. nnWe said we wouldn’t tell our parents (partly because we went from 0-60 MPH in 3 seconds and one simple turn of the wheel we would’ve literally fallen off of the mountain) but honestly this is such a big accomplishment for me! I mean I still to this day can’t order food for myself I tell my family what I want and they do it for me so the fact that I went up to her and then got to ride in a freaking TESLA is so so big for me!! I guess talking to people every now and then isn’t so bad and hopefully I can work up the courage in the future to do it.(I can’t wait to tell my therapist about this!!)",1
6556,"65madsquare","post","My desire to succeed is dwindling(long)","I am a 16 year old girl and an 11th year student(junior). Over the past years of Highschool I have become less motivated. I do maintain okay to good grades. My freshman year I had a 4.00, and my sophomore year I had a 3.8 gpa. But, with junior year about to begin my motivation isn’t there. At the start of Highschool I was already not motivated, and I kind of just went through the motions. Luckily, I am a people pleaser. So, even if I am not motivated in the slightest I think about how my teachers would perceive me. I want them to see me as a good student. The last time I genuinely did work just for myself was elementary school. nnI feel like I am incredibly inadequate. English is my only strong area, and I take college level courses for it. I also take journalism, and creative writing. I love writing. The thing is I absolutely dislike math. I am taking a normal level math class(algebra 2). It is a chore for me to study and pay attention in class when it comes to math. I have to exert so much self restraint to concentrate. Sometimes I get into such a negative state of mind that I can’t even hear the teacher explaining the math. I drown everything out, and then I quickly get lost. I really cannot understand how someone would enjoy math. But, the problem that I am starting to become aware of is that the stem field Majors earn the most. I can’t just become a journalist. It is not a viable career option. Journalism is a dying field. nnIt is all so disheartening. I am sub par at anything stem field related, and so I am destined to just have a terrible low paying job. I want more for myself, but I cannot do a stem field job.  I am always wondering what I envision for my future career. I am not that passionate about anything else. The only other thing that I might want to do is psychology. I have thought about becoming a clinical psychologist. But really, I don’t even have a vague sense of what my future could look like. In school we had to take a career analysis assessment. When my results came back it stated that based off of my interests no career areas were found. I don’t even know how that is possible. I was the only one in my class that that happened to.nnAnd to add on…nnI have not had any friends since I was 12 or 13 and in the 7th grade. And even when I did have ""friends"" they weren’t really friends. It was more so just people that I occasionally talked to, or hung out with during breaks. I have severe to moderate social anxiety. Online schooling and social distancing has not improved my anxiety in social situations. I can’t fathom school opening, and having to interact with others in person.nnAnd I want to make it clear that I am not a misanthrope. I do enjoy people, and the interesting qualities and experiences they hold. I like talking to others, but fear is what hinders me from doing so. My irrational fears have trapped me within a cycle of self isolation. And I know my fears are irrational, but It seems as if there is a roadblock that stops me from overcoming the power of my thoughts. I have no grip on how I want to feel, and even the tiniest intrusive thought can make me plummet into a full blown session of self deprecation. For the past 4 years I have been stuck. nnEvery time that I have tried to befriend someone it usually ends within a short period. We will hang out for a couple of weeks, and then they will become bored of me. I don’t know exactly why. I am quiet, so maybe they take this as a sign of being aloof. I can’t pinpoint why. nnAnd I do like being alone. I can enjoy being alone for longer periods of time than the average person. But, there comes a point in which being alone turns into loneliness. I start to think about cool things that I could be doing if I had friends. I start to think about all the friendships that I am missing out on. I have this irrational fear that when I talk to someone they will think I am an idiot. They will come to the same conclusions as I have; that I am in fact ugly, stupid, weird, and a slew of other negative qualities. nnAnd I have this worrying suspicion that maybe all of my irrational thoughts and feelings are true. What if all my life ever equates to is failed attempts at social interactions? What if I never experience deep and meaningful friendships that I carry with me for a lifetime? I haven’t had a friend since I was 12. It‘s not that I get bullied. My peers treat me normally, but I don’t enjoy being vulnerable. nnI know that friendship, when basically analyzed is a swapping of information. You share intimate details with someone else, and in that way your platonic relationship feels, and is different than the ones you share with random people or acquaintances. But, I can’t seem to commit myself to that. My lack of vulnerability with others leads them to get bored of me, and I completely understand. It is my fault, not theirs. nnI used to attend therapy a year ago, but stopped. After 3 sessions I quit. It’s not because I didn’t like my therapist. They were very kind and affable. But, the truth is I lied. I lied to save myself perceived embarrassment. I lied about how I want to kill myself. I downplayed my morbid thoughts about death. I downplayed my social anxiety, and how much it does interfere with my relationships, and day to day life. Therapy became a game of, ""let’s show the therapist I am normal and don’t need therapy."" nnI have never had those hallmark teenage rites of passage. And I know it is stupid to get caught up in these, but I want it so badly. I want to feel normal. I would rather peak in Highschool knowing that I collected all the teenage rites of passage. If I have peaked(which I believe is true) I am absolutely pathetic. nnI don’t know how to help myself at this point. This feeling of destiny is overwhelming. I feel doomed(which I know it is so pessimistic), but I can’t seem to help it. I know, that from a objective perspective these thoughts are irrational, but I still let it control me. I have so many intrusive thoughts. I am tired of getting the same worn out responses telling me that it will get better.nnI am so worn out by the everyday tasks of life. The normal things seem so daunting to me, and exhaust me. What truly scares me and keeps me up at night, is that my life hasn’t even really started. I am just at the precipice. How can I except to flourish in adulthood when I am already so tired, and on the verge of giving up? I don’t want to do this anymore, and I am trying so hard not to give up. I am trying not to hate myself, but I just can’t commit. Everything is out of reach.",1

But I’m pretty sure that my entire crew of coworkers is making fun of me and it’s starting to get really bad to the point where I like none of them respect me. Some backstory on why they might not except respect me is because I basically ask them for help and feedback when I’m actually not doing a bad job. But with this whole pandemic my anxiety is gotten like really bad and I’ve been kind of back spiraling or whatever. Also I have an abusive mother who I live with and I’ve been talking about a little bit on my close friends story on Instagram with a few coworkers that I trusted. One of them started like talking over me and being kind of aggressive and just like kind of being disrespectful to the point where eventually I got angry because she like whatever did some shit that pissed me off it was a little while ago but like I wasn’t really mad but I was just like Bro I’m sitting here trying to do my job and like people are talking over me and doing my job for me when I don’t need them to. It’s just annoying because I’m the type of person who like respects peoples shit but like aha. nI also have ADHD and like yeah I’ve just been forgetting more and more shit because like I’m really like paranoid about getting fired and like my coworkers just not liking or respecting me like I don’t care if they like me to be honest but I care if they respect me. Some thing that really got me was like the other day they were like repetitively saying the word actually like and I’m pretty sure they were making fun of me. When I was younger my grandparents who are now passed away used to mock me or like joke about how I would say the word actually and I think they were doing the same thing except not in the same way and I also might be on the spectrum like ass burgers but I haven’t really gotten diagnosed because it’s corona time and I just really don’t want to go to a psychiatrist right now and I don’t feel like it imperative that I get diagnosed immediately or whatever. But yeah I’m like low-key freaking the fuck out and spiraling and like that one person or like one of the people who I had on my close friends list where I would talk about my personal shit like I was like talking over me that one day who I got really mad at texting me that day being like hey like do we have a problem or some shit like because we can settle it like I don’t know she was being aggressive though and I was just like I’ve been supporting my coworkers who are a bunch of different races (which I don’t want like/ need cudos or whatever for) but like I think I just let them take advantage of me and yea. Not rlly sure what to do now.",0
6558,"CloutComputing","post","I feel like my lack of dating experience, anxiety, intimacy and privacy is hampering my dating prospects at 25","I hope someone can help me here because I need it. The past 2 weeks, I've gotten more experience with dating than I have in the past 2 decades. It is hard to believe that I just had my first kiss this past weekend, but when I was in middle and high school, I subconsciously had low self-esteem, which made me believe that I wasn't worthy of asking any girl out, despite the fact that I wasn't ugly. Maybe race had something to do with this, but then again it may have been my undiagnosed social anxiety. nnIn college (2014-2019), it was a similar story, except that's when I started to pay more attention to the fact that I was perpetually single. I first started posting to Reddit about all of this under the username u/fa9cmy6w34i6y98ctrqc, but I stopped posting with this account. Back then I was still somewhat reserved, but also had low self esteem. I was also at a tech college with an 80-20 male-to-female ratio, yet I lived on campus without a car. nnI transferred to a larger school near home 2 years later. Part of this was for academic reasons, the other part for the lack of dating opportunities. Over the next 3 years, I joined a club and a sports team, which became my primary social outlet and where my friend circle grew from. Yet I was still extroverted, but socially anxious. The thought of losing my virginity, being a virgin and having never kissed a girl grew prominent as the years went by. nnAfter graduation, I served in a national service program for about 6 months, traveling the country for disaster relief in a program with about 150 people, in the 18-24 age range. Again, I had a secondary goal of progressing with dating in all of this. Nothing came of it. nnThe pandemic hit. I went from age 23 to now 25 in this time, living at home with my parents and without social interactions. I tried using dating apps for 2 months, paid $70, and got nowhere. I deleted them to try and get my sanity back. I reinstalled them, had the same problem. In December, I did it again, but this time I used Facebook Dating, which was where I found the girl who I've been talking to and been on 2 dates with since Dec. 24. She lives an hour away. Prior to meeting her, I had only been on 4 dates in my life. I've had 6 now. nnShe knows that I'm inexperienced with dating, and to be honest, she's pretty isolated and shy too. Yet she's still been in a relationship or two since maybe 18-20 (she's 24). Which is expected. Still, I find myself having anxiety over our interactions. We text every day, maybe about 8-10 messages. I think things can progress well, but with the lack of privacy I mentioned in the title (we live with our parents), the only intimacy that we can have is likely in my car or a hotel room, two uncomfortable and awkward options. Yet physical intimacy is the skill that I lack. The 2 kisses we had were basic and juvenile, but then again, if I've never kissed how am I supposed to practice?nnI hope she isn't losing interest because she senses the lack of experience. I'm not sure where I should turn or how to think. My goal is to move out of the house by April regardless, but That can't come fast enough.",0

I feel this way even when someone just says hi to me. I usually get scared and run away without even saying hi back. I don't want to self diagnose at all. I just it makes interacting with others really hard, but I love talking to people when I'm not scared out of my mind. With quarantine still going on I've been the most comfortable I've ever been, but I'm starting to realize that I'm going to have to interact with some people eventually. One example of how severe it can get is when I met my best friend's dad for the first time I stood in his living room shaking, my heart was racing, blushing, sweating, and I felt like I was going to throw up. It made it really hard for me to talk and I know the only reason I even made it there is because it was for her birthday. I'm scared that I'm wrong and that I'll embarrass myself if I try to talk to a doctor about it. Thanks for everything in advance",0
6563,"happinessismine","post","Being an immigrant has made my social anxiety so much worse.","Hi everyone! So it's been a year since I (23F) moved to another country, I should note that the local language isn't my native language but I speak it pretty fluently as a second language (this is important to my post, you'll see why), and overall it's been great. Pretty crazy that I managed to move to another country alone considering my anxiety issues but it also makes sense in some ways. My home country is quite small and conservative and I had lived in the same city for over 20 years, almost my whole life, before I came here so I really enjoy the anonymity and freedom, also I'm queer and my new country is a lot safer for me in that sense. But the problem is that my social anxiety has gone THROUGH THE ROOF since I came here, like I was treated and medicated for anxiety in my teens so it's something I have a history of and thought I had at least somewhat under control, until maybe a few months after I came here.nnI guess I started experiencing culture shock and increasingly I became scared of situations that involved me having to talk to people, especially complete strangers but not exclusively, and much of this revolves around the fact that, while I speak the local language more than well enough to function in everyday situations, I have a pretty noticeably foreign accent. As in, people understand me most of the time, but they know basically straight away once I open my mouth that I'm not from here... and it sucks because this sort of judgment, while not (usually) ill-intentioned, bothers me and I'm not sure why. I think it's partly because I'm afraid of standing out in a negative way and being perceived as ""weird"" or ""different"" but, whatever the cause, it prevents me from living my life normally. I completely avoid going to shops that don't have self-service checkouts, when I go to bars I give my friends money to order drinks at the bar for me, I've put so many administrative tasks on hold if they don't have an online service that replaces going to their physical office and talking to someone, like I've wanted to join my city library for so long now but I've avoided doing it because there's no way to sign up online and you have to talk to someone in person, and perhaps worst of all I live with flatmates and avoid being in the common areas at the same time as them (including the kitchen, not ideal when you already suffer from an eating disorder). I work from home too, my job was in a small office but remote working came in back in March due to Covid-19 and we have stayed this way since, I'm going into the second year of my postgraduate degree in just over a month's time and that's also going to be mostly remote, all of which allows me to isolate myself even more than I would normally.nnHonestly the only times I'm truly comfortable are when I go outside in my city and walk through the crowds without talking to anyone, like in shopping centres or metro stations or markets where I can sort of just exist and blend into a crowd without being perceived by people. It's truly a sad way of living, I wish I was comfortable enough to be able to go into shops and cafés and talk to people and order things like a normal person but I just... can't get over my fear of being perceived and evaluated. It really sucks. Even in spite of everything I'd rather die living like this in this country than ever go back home but it would be nice if I could actually make the most of being here and the freedom I've gained. I don't know if anyone else here has a similar situation or has any advice for starting to overcome it, but honestly if you made it to the end of this long-ass post then thank you. &lt;3",1

6566,"WexArexInfinite","post","My inspiration story I guess?","I've been lurking in this sub Reddit for a bit, but I just wanted to make a post. I guess what I've been taking away from this sub is that everyone's social anxiety is different, everyone has different things that make them anxious even tho yes we can all relate in some aspect, it's kind of like being on a spectrum. Some people have it worse than others. I guess I just wanted to share my story. I'm 23F, I was officially diagnosed with social anxiety at 18, it made sense. I always just thought I was ""shy"" but when I got to learn more about what social anxiety was, WOW everything made sense. I was kind of relieved that there was a word for it and not just ""shy"" I felt more validated, and I love getting to talk to people who also have it. nnAnyways, I just wanted to share that YES I have social anxiety but I cope with it. After I found out I had it, I guess it made it easier for me to manage? I found out what triggered me, what to avoid, or if I knew I was going to go into a situation that would trigger my anxiety, at least I KNEW I was going into that situation so I could try and relax myself and not be as anxious. Yes, still try to avoid uncomfortable situations as much as possible, but if it's unavoidable, just go with it. nnI go to concerts by myself, I lived in Iceland by myself, I traveled around Europe by myself. I do EVERYTHING by myself. I didn't have siblings, I grew up always managing to entertain myself with just me. So these factors I feel like are the reason I can cope with my anxiety the way I do. The fact that my mom is my best friend and not a helicopter parent, she put me in pre-school which 3 year old me dreaded but in the long run, I think that social interaction was needed. I have 3 REALLY close best friends in my life, and they're all I need. nnI found out what works for me, and how to cope. I gave amazing presentations in highschool and went above and beyond for school projects. I joined the drama club for a bit. I don't drink alcohol or anything, I just learned to find my balance. And what really helped me honestly (don't worry I won't turn this into a religion post) was becoming a Buddhist. Learning about Buddhism almost made my anxiety disappear. I started practicing when I was 18 and it really changed my life. nnSo to sum this up in short, I still suffer from social anxiety, but it's manageable and it can get better as long as you work on yourself and find out what works for YOU. I have a customer service job for god's sakes 🤣 I HATE talking to people. But I answer phones for a living. I love my job, and my coworkers, and everyone's social anxiety is a bit different, I still get anxious at work and when I go to concerts alone, but I know how to relax myself now and try not to let it get to me anymore. I can still suffer from anxiety attacks every now and then if I'm not careful, but my social anxiety is manageable, and I think everyone here can learn to manage their's as well once they find that balance and how to cope.nnSorry for the TLDR, message me or comment if you wanna talk about anything or have any questions, I'd like to be more active here c:",1

She has bad anxiety because she got badly bullied in middle and high school. She sat alone at lunch everyday and was the person that nobody wanted to be partners with, and many more things. However, she graduated in 2016. Four years ago. She has not done anything with herself since. She won’t go to college because she has anxiety and thinks people won’t like her. Online classes she won’t do because she doesn’t want too or is scared too. I’ve tried helping her apply for FAFSA and also suggested maybe a trade school if university setting isn’t what she wants to do, she doesn’t want to do that either. nShe can’t hold a job because she’s has massive freak outs and gets fired. My parents continuously pay for her for anything and honestly baby her. She literally sits in this house everyday glued to her phone. She doesn’t have to pay any bills or have any type of responsibility.nnShe refuses to go to the grocery store to buy food for herself because a few people from high school work there. Yes she is 22 years old and has never gone to the store by herself or doctors appointments. When she goes to the store with me or my mom she never gets anything and starts having a break down and goes to the car. So she rarely goes. She’s very aggravating on that aspect mainly Because she whines and whines at home about how there’s nothing to eat but refuses to help herself. She won’t tell anybody what she wants to eat and it’s like a guessing game. She orders food for herself on door dash a lot but everyone in my house thinks it would be cheaper for her to just go to the store or write a list and have someone pick it up for you. Since She only makes money off of selling her old clothes off poshmark, that is currently her only source of income. Which isn’t much. She is also terrified of driving and refuses to drive anywhere. (I had to drive her to her job when she had one, because my parents made me, she refused to drive herself). nnI told my sister who cares who works at the store, they will get fired if they say anything to you, who cares what they think, they work at a grocery store and she’s like easy for you to say you weren’t the one bullied.  nnI told her you can’t live the rest of your life being afraid of going to the grocery store, or driving or going to college or even being out in public because of being bullied at school in the past.

6589,"professor_57","post","My SAD story","SAD is the most appropriate acronym for social anxiety disorder lolnnI have been meaning to make this post for a while now. I am an adult now, so its easier to talk about these things as if they happened to someone else. My disorder first flared up when I was in middle school. It manifested itself as a fear of people and judgement, and I absolutely refused to go to school.   It must have been really troublesome for my parents, but fortunately they took the right decision to take me to psychiatrists. Unfortunately, none of those people could help me. I was diagnosed with OCD, and given medication (which I did not take at that time). My parents decided that psychiatrists or therapy was a waste of time, and decided to cure it themselves by doling out corporal punishment. I did live with strict asian parents, so this was a natural thing in society. nnSoon afterwards, my ""condition"" got worse, and I chose to be punished rather than go to school. So that was my routine - wake up, get beat up, stay at home to enjoy my free time. When negotiation and the stick didn't work, I ultimately had to be transferred from one school to another. A new school means new people, therefore my fear of judgement subsided..for a while. I somehow managed to make it past middle school, even though the same problem happened again in the new school. I even got good grades because I was kind of smart(for a middle schooler) and studied.nnIn highschool, things got worse, much worse. This time I got a low grade in my physics exam. Due to being lonely, and always working on math problems in class (the only thing I enjoyed in school), this perception of ""bad with studies"" made me unable to go to school again. I remember those days where I would dress up as if I was going to school, and then return shortly later, overcome with fear. My father turned to alcoholism at this time point, and my mother (dealing with huge amount of stress thanks to my behavior and an absent husband) took out much of her anger on me. nnAnd therefore, I coped the only way I knew how - by shutting myself out. From middle school to high school, I had acquired a private room. And if things got worse, I would just shut myself inside. It didn't always work of course - since my parents could break down the door sometimes. Sometimes I had to move the bookshelf. Since my parents did not want me to die, they fed me from time to time. For me, high school was a time of total isolation. I only went out to get food. One day I found a cockroach inside my pants. Cute little thing, trying to keep me company.  nnThings weren't so bad for me though. I had books to keep me company - I would read anything I got my hands on. I had a PC, and eventually internet too. I got into video games, anime, novels. I became a part of online community where I ""felt"" accepted. They were my refuge, but I think they were also things that kept me inside the dark world. Porn eventually came into the picture too. It wasn't easy keeping these luxuries, so I started to fast when they took away my internet privilege. That's how I ruined my body. nnEventually, my parents decided that I was no longer fit to go to a proper school, so I became home schooled. This was a wise decision on their part. Thanks to that, I got to slack off from studying everything except maths (the only thing I was good at). My parents hired private tutors who would literally come to teach me and fall asleep on my desk. One of those teachers tried to molest me - he (an old creepy guy) wanted to see my penis. Good thing I refused. Occasionally my mother lost her shit and tried to burn down the house or fight me. Other than that, good times.nnAnd so I gave my exams. I expected to get good grades in maths and fail in everything else. What happened was that I failed in maths, and got a passing grade in everything else. LOL. Serves me right for slacking off.nnAnd so, there went my dreams of studying math in university.nnI did submit my answer for a regrade, and they decided to just barely make me pass math. So I was able to enroll in a shitty private college where all the failures went. At this point, something changed in me. May be it was the years of isolation, but I enjoyed class. I devoted myself to learning. I lived in a dorm about 2 hours away from home, and that was a great help since I was finally ""independent"" to a small extent. I experienced some growth.nnOf course, years of social isolation does not make you a star at getting along with others. So I was bullied in college too (and here I thought they were adults). I guess you could say that I tried to reach the ""Starting line"" that everyone else has already passed. Of course, no relationships, very few friends (huge improvement) - but I spent most of my time in my studies so I never had time for that either. And I goddam enjoyed it. I was nicknamed ""the professor"", and that's where this username comes from. nnThings got worse again though - and the pattern started to show itself. This happened as I started to question my professors on what they were teaching. Remember that this was a shitty private school that I attended, so the teachers were underqualified. At this point, I had caught up with them, and I learned mostly from online courses and textbooks. This completely destroyed my reputation in college - I was despised by the teachers as being the guy who thinks he's too smart. They would literally scream at me when I pointed out their mistake. At this point, I stopped asking questions and focused on my own studies. I stopped coming to class - not because of my disorder, but because it was a waste of time. The teachers capitalized on it, and did not let me take my practical exams. Thankfully, it was just plain bullying, since they didn't actually want me to fail.  Anyway, I passed with an average grade. That was the end of that.nn&amp;#x200B;nnUgh, I think I've typed enough. I go to a great university thanks to part luck and part hard work, I find few friends with whom I can actually connect intellectually and emotionally (sometimes). I am able to graduate with great grades. The problem manifests again, and this time it happens AFTER I finish my masters (I underestimated my own development). \*sigh\*. Stuff(coronavirus) happens, and I get two offers for PhD program - and that's where I am at now. I look forward to being slave #4 at my research institute!  Ah , may be this time I can finally experience ""relationship"" and ""dating"" that young people always keep talking about. Or may be I'll fuck it all up and isolate myself again! Whatever the case, I will move forward and find out. nnI hope you have learned something from my story. Or at least may be it is a comfort to know that someone else is a bigger moron than you are. To those who actually read the entire thing - I apologize for taking so much of your time. I wanted to be honest, once. I don't think I can live with myself, since a lot of time I just end up distracting myself from myself. But I'll do my best. I know my limitations now. The pattern is clear to me, although my ability to deal with it is still a work in progress. I haven't seen a therapist, but I want to do it once I have some money and stability. nn&amp;#x200B;nnAs I see it, the problem with SAD, and people who suffer trauma and certain mental illness, is a psychological deficiency. They don't know how to live normally. And so, the resources of society are locked to them. Shunned by their peers, and by themselves (especially if they don't understand what they are going through), they fall into an even darker hole. People talk all the time about ""accepting"" people with mental illness, but that actually requires the mentally ill to come out as mentally ill. I would never do that, I fear judgement, why in the world would I tell anyone this stupid story. Accept your limitations for what they are, and move forward knowing that even the passing breeze can make you fall down on your face. Even if you are alone, live life to the fullest. nnAmor Fati",0

6594,"myzteriious","post","Social anxiety - my story","Just using this space to rant and tell you how I felt/feel. nnPretty sure I've had anxiety my whole entire life but it got worse around the ages of 11/12. I was always the 'quiet kid' at school and could never get out of that title. Breakfast before school was a meal I always struggled with. My mum constantly took me to the doctors for my tummy aches/ nausea but they never found anything. Before the ages of 11-12, I was able to make a few friends and I was pretty content with life. I didn't really talk to anyone at school apart from my own friend group. They always questioned why I was so loud around them but quiet around others. But I wasn't too bothered about it as much as my mum was. She had to deal with me tagging along behind her when we'd visit relatives/friends that happened to have kids around my age. And although I found it harder to make friends than most, as I got to know others I'd get comfortable pretty quick. I was very close with all my cousins and would frequently have sleepovers.nnHowever, fast forward to 11-12, that changed. A lot of changes had occurred. My grandma had passed away from cancer. My mum had a falling out with her siblings so we lost connection to her side of the family. I was really close to her side of the family but lost contact so that hurt. This was also the time I started secondary school. I was heartbroken going to a school without my best friends. But I had many aspirations. I wanted to re brand myself. Make many friends. Be popular. Confident. Happy. I wanted to work on my goal of singing. nnAnd honestly, I started off really well. I made two best friends instantly. I performed in a small play. I started to put up my hand in class to answer.nnHowever, this 'luck' didn't last. I suddenly started to feel more insecure. I fell back on my usual habits. Not talking to anyone but my close friends. These two new friends were my friends for the rest of my 5 years at secondary school. I couldn't communicate to anyone else but these two friends. nnA girl then started a rumour about me, that I had cheated on my school work by looking at others' work. I did glance at a girls work but it was because I needed glasses as couldn't see the white board. Andddd I was scared to ask what the work on the board was. I was also too scared to tell my mum that I might need glasses. The girl that started the rumour, then started bullying me. She would constantly mutter profanities and mean things about my appearance. She whispered things about me to other girls at school. With my luck, I was paired up with her for P.E, where she'd chuck the netball at my stomach and face, really hard, when we were meant to just pass the ball to each other. She would purposely trip me up so that I'd fall. I didn't even tell anyone because I was embarrassed and she was popular. Not even my mum knew. She just knew that I suddenly hated and dreaded going to school. I cried every night and nobody knew. Hearing the alarm sound I used then still brings up the feeling of anxiety and fear that I felt that year. nnAfter a few months of bullying, she apologised. She had gone through so much trauma at home and placed it on me. I do forgive her but her torment really affected me. The little confidence I had was completely gone. I no longer trusted anyone. I couldn't open up to anyone else. nnI started to distance myself from my cousins. I didn't have anything to say. I felt like a burden. Around everyone. I felt like they hated me. I became less social. I spoke less to people I was close to. I became quiet to everyone. I stopped going to sleepovers. I stopped going out with them. I stopped speaking to them.nnSame with my close friends. I was in a friend group of three. The other two friends were much closer. They always had inside jokes and would always speak outside of school. I was never part of it. I stayed in that situation because they could make me laugh, I had quite a few things in common and because I had no one else. I couldn't communicate in the way that I did before being bullied. Never did I ever feel like I belonged. I still felt like a burden. I'm sure I wouldn't be so left out if I could open up but I couldn't. The fear always crept in.nnSo there I was, constantly feeling like I didn't matter. That no one wanted me around. Feeling like I'm a waste of space. I don't add anything to a conversation, so why should I still be around. I was thirteen and all I wanted to do was die. I didn't know there was something wrong with me but it was confusing seeing how my peers could carry conversation so well when I just sat quietly in the corner. I searched up my feelings into google. Social anxiety. I read all the symptoms. Did various quizzes. Watched videos. Did a lot of research. I know it's not good self diagnose but I ticked every single symptom and more. And although I felt understood, I hated that there was something wrong. And this something had to be fixed, by no one else but me. nnI slowly plucked up the courage to tell my mum. I'm Asian so mental health isn't really spoken about and of course, she thought I was being ridiculous.'You'll grow out of it' she said. I wanted to be properly diagnosed so I could get help but I couldn't. I could be a whole different person today if I got the help then.nnAnd fast forward to now. I'm 18, nearly 19, and still stuck in this stupid cycle. But it's worse. I started sixth form in 2018, leaving my two friends behind. I thought about the friendship and realised the toxicity of it. One of the friends would always question every time I achieved something or got good grades. She'd make me feel unworthy and say that she deserved it more. What's ridiculous, is that I would comfort her and make her feel like she deserved it more. It hurt a lot as I loved her so much but I didn't want to go through another two years of that. We left on a good note and kept in contact.nnI wanted to re brand again and make new friends. This time I was so confident and ready. I started off well for 2 weeks and then I just couldn't. I had so many potential friends but I just couldn't communicate and open up. I still kept in touch with my two, old friends as much as I could. It felt like I was making the effort and they weren't. It made feel like trash. The toxic friend would always say we should meet up but the plans would never happen. We made plans to meet near her house and then she wouldn't respond to my messages. I had traveled on the bus for an hour to see her, only for her to not show up. She did this twice and it left me even more broken. She would then make plans with my other friend and put it all over snapchat without telling me. I'm sure she knew I'd want to come. Seeing my only two close friends hang out without me and having no friends at college broke me down. nnOctober 2018. I wanted to end it. I was so done. I felt so lonely. So useless. So broken. I was praying that harm would just come my way so that I wouldn't hurt my family on purpose. I wished and wished for death. I had started therapy at this point for my social anxiety, it was only a few weeks. My mum had finally come around to the idea because throughout the years she had heard more about anxiety and depression. She realised how common it was but didn't understand why I had it because she gave me everything and didn't 'hit me' like other Asian parents. She thought good grades=happiness. I was in so much unexplainable pain during this time so I just lied through some of the therapy session. They'd give me questionnaires to fill out. Something along the lines of 'Have you ever thought of dying?' and I ticked yes. When the therapist asked me about it, I denied it but really I didn't want to explain and I was scared of the consequences of admitting something like that. She referred me somewhere else because my social anxiety wasn't improving but I didn't go because therapy felt so physically and mentally draining. I felt so unmotivated when I got back from a session because I had let a lot out. nnMy birthday wish was to die. nnI mean.....it still hasn't happened yet, so I guess for some strange reason, maybe I'm meant to be here.nnI'm still lonely. I'm still in pain. I still think about dying sometimes. But I know I wouldn't do it because I couldn't do that to my younger brother, let alone my mum and dad. They don't know it but they mean the world to me. I'm only here because of them and....the fact that I'm scared of hell.nnRight now, I'm in a weird place. My A-level exams got cancelled and we got given grades according to the progress we've made at school. My poor mental health caused a decline in these grades so now I can't go uni. I cried for a good few days. My parents were pretty disappointed but they know these grades don't reflect me. Maybe I needed a gap year but I'm going to be alone to myself for a whole year and I'm really scared about it. I don't know how I'm going to handle it.nnAlthough quarantine felt good as I didn't have to interact with people, I felt so alone. I only had my parents and brother to talk to. Sometimes I didn't even have them. I still had multiple panic attacks. I get a lot of those randomly. nnSo that's where I am as of now. Still an anxious, socially awkward, ball of energy. I want to get out. I really do. I just wish I knew how. nnHow do I get out of this cycle? How do I reconnect with my cousins? What do I even say....""I'm sorry I've been socially isolating myself for the past 7 years but hi this is me...."" ????? How do people always know what to say at the right time?

I have since been on a downwards spiral and I deeply regret this decision, the guilt is killing me but the idea of being out interacting with others still terrifies me","Back then while studying and working at an internship I remember how dealing with people all day left me exhausted. From the moment I took a bus from college to work I would only have bad thoughts about myself to the point that, at the end of the week, I felt physically tired of my own negativity. I didn't had friends at college, and while the environment and the people at the internship were great my social anxiety never let me get close to any of them, which I deeply regret. Being a closeted transgender always added to the stress, its not other people's fault I'm like this, but to know everyone around me saw me as a man disgusted me. Besides work and college I did nothing, it was just work, college and home.nnBack then it wasn't on my mind to become a hermit, I actually had a lot of plans. When there wasn't much work to be done I would look at this website of a prestigious office from my field that has headquarters in Europe and dreamed of working there. I thought I could continue my education abroad, I actually even stupidly mentioned that to an uncle when he asked me about post-college plans. Despite my parents being against me being trans it I thought maybe once I was done with college they would finally agree to help me transition. I figured one year would be enough, I would graduate, stop working, and transition in the safety of home without having to leave while I didn't felt comfortable. My parents wanted me to start a postgraduate course or another course in a different area right away, but I said no because I had all of these plans in my head.nnIt never happened, and this year turned into 4 in a blink of an eye. I didn't lived these years and they just passed me by, and I'm never getting them back. I literally did nothing with my life, just hid at home. At first it felt so good not having deadlines, not having to interact with anyone, it almost made me forget I am different. But 2 years ago I started waking up to reality, that I can't go on this way forever and that I wasted my early 20s. I feel so guilty that I wasted my life, that I make my parents stress about my future. I've seen a therapist for a little over a year (stopped because of the pandemic) but it didn't helped at all. nnLooking back I miss the feeling of doing something. To feel like you're part of something, to go to class, attend seminars of professionals who did amazing work. But at the same time the idea of waking up early and going to home when its getting dark while still not being able to be myself, not having friends and no social life just seem miserable to me. And even then, who would even hire me? I'm ok at best, and my resume is awful with just one employment from 4 years ago and terrible social skills. I would never get accepted in a mediocre place, let alone that office of my dreams. It's like I'm at a crossroads and every option is as bad as the next. nnI don't know what I want with this post, I just need to vent because I've been crying nonstop for days and I don't know how to deal with the stress and the guilt anymore. I'm only 24 and I feel so old, I have eye bags from my messed up sleep schedule and I'm going bald due to genetics. I feel like I'm 70 looking back at all of my life regrets and its killing me.",1

I was also diagnosed with a panic disorder, as well as a tic disorder and BFRB that both stemmed from my anxiety. When asked what route I would like to take for  treatment, I independently agreed with my therapist that a mix of therapy and medication would be the best. The plan was that with therapy I would be able to learn strategies to help me cope with my overwhelming social anxiety as well as panic attacks that may pop up, and the medication (I was prescribed the starter dose of Zoloft, which I would only take for a year or a year and a half) would help me better function by simply suppressing my social anxiety a bit. However, my parents refuse to fill out my Zoloft prescription or let me take any medication. They believe that I will become “dependent” on it and are scared of side effects, and insist these views even after my psychiatrist consistently reassures them that Zoloft is harmless and non addictive and that someone my age can be easily weened off of it. Furthermore— my stepdad thinks my mental health will instantly improve if I just make some “lifestyle changes.” So for the past months have been going to therapy (or, rather, teletherapy)— there I HAVE learned coping techniques, which I practice regularly, and do help me control my social anxiety— however, there are moments, especially now with school starting, that I feel that I need medication to help curb my anxiety some so that I can function normally. There are times where my anxiety becomes overwhelming or I’m simply unprepared/unable to perform a grounding strategy where I really wish my parents had filled out my Zoloft prescription. Any advice?",1

6608,"dgreenmissile","post","First time here. This is a brief summary of my life pre and with social anxiety","I’m 23 yrs old, graduated High School in 2015, had a tragic childhood. Dad was, and still is an alcoholic. He would beat up my mom infront of my sisters and me. Had to endure that life since I could remember until I turned 8. That’s when my mom moved to the US. 2 years later my sisters and I moved as well. Went to a party and participated on a dancing game. They played a Spanish line dancing song that I had never heard. People laughed at me for not knowing the moves and had to go home crying. Since then I rejected going to parties, and when I would go, I would seat by myself. Got bullied in High School for not knowing how to speak English. That caused me to not talk at school a lot. I would do presentations, I would get nervous, but nothing out of the ordinary. I learned English in 1 year. I would still get anxiety when speaking to other students though, so I would seat in the spanish table. I had to transfer school during the last 2 years of high school. There was no spanish table so I sat alone during lunch for those 2 years. I graduated with honors. Went to college for an easy accounting course. Finished it in a year. Worked at a car insurance office. (No interview needed) but had to take phone calls and that wrecked me. Only worked at the office for 3 days. I would vomit, sweat at night, peed on the bed, and had nightmares. Took Therapy, anti depressants, Attempted suicide. Took therapy again, more anti depressants. Went to 4 more interviews, bombed all 4 of them. I blanked out, got all sweaty, got pale, almost cried. They told me to go back when I was ready. Never went back. Visited my grandparents after 11 years. Came back, and everything is the same. nnnThere’s another personal side of me which I don’t know if I can discuss. I am a JW, but don’t feel like I belong. Stopped going to the meetings for almost 1 year now. The brothers never shunned me. I actually felt really good there. But I felt like I wasn’t giving my all so I got discouraged and stopped attending the meetings. They teach us how to do public talks. Tried it once and I regret ever accepting to do a public talk. The audience were friends. I felt comfortable around them but I just blanked out and forgot everything. Had to read from my notes. I got drunk after leaving, I stopped praying for almost 6 months now. And now I have huge feeling of guilt on top of my anxiety. I was just remembering some of my old friends which most likely moved already. nnnI am unhappy with myself. Both of my sisters are fully functional human beings, but I am the one who has this struggle. Never asked anything from anyone. Always tried to do anything for the interest of others. I feel like I’ll never be happy. If anyone understands me I would really appreciate some words of advice. Lately I’ve been feeling really distressed. I am trying to cry but I can’t anymore. I guess what I’m going through is anxiety mixed with depression. One of the most awful feelings I’ve experienced.",1

I have been diagnosed with social anxiety at 9 but never got any treatment and now that I’m on my own it’d be even more difficult to afford. I’m a 17 year old student living in London and since my budget is very low I have only been able to rent a room at a flat share and it’s been an absolute nightmare for me. I can go weeks without showering just because I’m basically unable to do it when there are other people in the house. There is obviously a lock so it’s completely irrational and I can’t even explain my own reasoning. It’s the same thing with using the kitchen. I usually go without eating till around midnight/1am when I’m sure people are asleep and I have been living on only ready meals because actually cooking anything else would be too loud and long enough that I can actually meet someone. People here are nice and I’ve never had any negative experiences with them yet I still can’t get rid of those irrational fears. The only place I feel safe is my room and even here whenever I hear anyone walking by I get stressed.

While I had some struggles with my disabilities when I was younger, they’re not the primary thing that’s held me back in my life. The main reason is simply because of opportunity, I went to an all boys school for my first two years of high school and transferred to this very small boarding school that my parents forced me to attend for my junior and senior years where the girls were absolutely hideous. I’m currently a student a Arizona State University but I’m online for the first-semester due to COVID-19 and I’m not even sure if I’m even going bank for the Spring-Semester this year. Because of all of this I’ve been pretty isolated at times from girls during my teenage years. nnAnyways, I went through Chick-fil-A today and I ended up having a friendly chat with Emily, the girl who took my order at the drive-through. She was really nice and I found her to be pretty attractive long brown hair, blue eyes, beautiful smile, etc. Towards the end of our conversation I debated whether I should ask her for her snapchat/phone number, but I kinda panicked and decided not to, even though she was really nice to me. This all happened about 4 hours ago and I’m kinda regretting not finding a way to stay in touch with her. I figured I’d ask what you guys would have done in this scenario?

I know my life sucked big time but I was wondering if anyone here had similar experiences with a toxic parent. I just wanted to vent as almost none knows about my life truly. I was an extrovert as a child. My mother however was hating me for being weird. I was talking everything I was thinking. I was unusual because I talked to grass and other weird stuff.  I had good perspective even as a public speaker. I was never shy. I had quite bad ADHD and was always in trouble which made my kindergarten teacher say I should receive better education. My brother was born with severe Down Syndrome and he needed help with everything. Eventually my mom became mentally ill. However even before, my mom tried to control me and shut me down and eventually when I was bad in school or I disagreed with her (I was always speaking my mind and I wasn't into school as a kid). She started beating me eventually. She was so furious with me. She didn't like me as a kid. Apparently there are lots of parents who expect their kid to be perfect. She told me many times that I shouldn't have been born. She limited my carrier dreams to stupid random stuff because I was average to bad in middle school. My dad was supporting me but he got ill with MS and he started to have mental and physical problems too. Luckily his disease didn't progress much. But he beat my mom and was hating her I guess for having a disabled kid but also other reasons. We were isolated mostly from family friends and family in general. We became poor and couldn't afford many basics although I always had food on the table. I'm from a second world country so not much help from the government was possible. I was mostly at school and at my grandparents in the summer. I rarely interacted with kids my age. I met my bestfriend when I was 8. She also had a disabled sister and she understood what I was going through. She's in another country now and me too. I still talk to her a lot, but she's far away. Without her in my life I would have killed my self long time ago. I have a boyfriend that I live with that understands me but it's still difficult when he's actually an extrovert. My anxiety got 1000 times worse here in Netherlands. I know it's my social anxiety too, but this country also isn't happy with strangers. I work in a fast food restaurant and I hate being watched by costumers all day. This kind of job drives me insane. I study so luckily I will be able to find a nice desk job in a few years. Until then my life seems a nightmare. I speak sometimes to a few people but I don't really have friends here. I don't have with anyone to go out just weekly or something. I wish I could talk easily to people. In my country at least people were nice to me. They understood more mental illnesses, traumas, being an introvert or just shy. Here everyone treats me like a weirdo. I guess I'll move countries and jobs all the time. Maybe a desk job will be cool someday.",0

I got out of it, but the sentiment creeps back every now and then. nnI always struggled with being told I was ""too old' for something as a kid, to the point when I was between 9-12 I desperately wanted to be 5 again, which was probably the happiest of my life. But most importantly, ever since I was 16 or 17 I've been completely obsessed with aging and the feeling of time passing. The years go by so fast, it's like I'm not even experiencing it, but rather it's like I'm already old in the future looking back to everything as if they were memories, not real experiences. nnThe idea of entering my 20s terrified me. When I read about a historical figure I always check what were they doing in their 20s, because those are supposed to be the best years of your life, and I would loose interest in reading about their later life. While I was a teen my 20s seemed so far away, but as I turned 18 or 19 I realized how close they were, and how each year I was further away from my goals.nnI remember being 21 and seething reading comments about teens,  I wanted to go back so badly. Now I'll soon turn 25 and all I want is to be 21 again. I wasted the last 4 years of my life, they passed by in the blink of an eye and I didn't even felt it. When reading about those historical figures I was younger than them, now I'm older and it stings. I can't go back and ""re-read"" my youth as I did to them. nnOnly when I was 23 that for almost the whole year I snapped out of this. I was in therapy, but it only helped me hide everything even more, though by doing that I stopped to think about the future and felt comfortable in my age for the first time in my life. Though around november it dawned on me I would be turning 24 and thus I would no longer be in my early 20s, and in just another year I'd be 25. I panicked, its been a year and since then I just lay in bed for over 3 hours some nights, unable to sleep properly. This worry consumes all of my thoughts, I can barely concentrate on anything, even things I enjoy like movies, because this is always on my mind.nnThere are more silly things too, like I can't believe Jennifer Lawrence turned 30 this year. I can vividly remember all the buzz around her winning an oscar at such a young age, it's like I watched her speech last night when she was an up and coming early 20s actress, and now she's 30. I can't comprehend it. nnWhen I see things happening is like I'm not even there, but rather I'm my old self in the future looking back to these memories. I know it sounds crazy, sometimes I think I'm actually loosing my mind. But if time passes so fast, are we ever in the present? nnI think what bothers me is that youth is all I have. I've been miserable and thinking of suicide daily since I was about 14, my teens sucked and I completely wasted my early 20s by hiding from the world, doing literally nothing with my life. I never lived, I just kept waiting for my life to start but it never did, and now it's too late to do anything to fix it. I don't have memories to look back fondly at, I never been anywhere, I never traveled, I didn't had friends to hang out with and do fun things with. nnIt's like I ruined my life in the blink of an eye, the shame and regret are killing me.",1

So even though I’ve been the person to try to hold onto him on the past, nowadays I just let it go to voicemail, especially because he went MIA for a couple of years when I had just become socially anxious. So talking to him is basically like talking to a stranger, and you can imagine how hard that is. That doesn’t help much for me feeling guilty though when his calls roll around and he leaves yet another voicemail. So, a few months ago, in the middle of the night I texted him a looong paragraph telling him how I don’t ignore him out of spite and anger (although I’m slowly realizing that I am probably due some anger and animosity, though that makes me want to gag). But I basically described to him how I’m not comfortable talking on the phone etc w/o directly telling him I have SA because I’m not comfortable talking about it yet. He responded saying he respects it and looks forward to forming a relationship with me. It was one of the hardest things I ever had to do. Fast forward to now, I had to visit the ER over the summer and had a couple of standard checkups that I suppose had a copay. My mom still has my sister and I using his insurance, which if it were up to me wouldn’t be the case because I understand how ridiculous it is to use his insurance but not even answer the phone for him, but I guess my mom feels that’s it’s the least he can do (he left my mom w/ a house and 2 children that she couldn’t provide on her own and he’s now only paying child support because she took him to court but he willingly  wanted to give her full custody [which is a huge slap in the face] but she insisted on him having weekends although he hasn’t made an attempt to be in our lives until like last year) so I understand my mom cus she struggles to get us our own insurance but I’d just rather not have any obligations to him. After the ER bill was sent to him, my mom basically forced me to call him to settle it which I understand. I called him solely to discuss the bill because talking to him is hard for me but he wanted to talk talk and he didn’t even respond to about the bill as if he was going to handle it which I thought would be decent of him. But then he continues to call for a couple of days then texts me saying he received a bill from me and we need to talk about it. I simply texted him I can pay it and asked how he wanted me to send it but he didn’t respond. He continues to blow my phone up for the next two months and I of course didn’t answer and I beat myself up for it a lot bc I just started college and stuff and I thought he wanted to be a part of it but I just wasn’t ready for that. He left so many voicemails saying how that’s what he was calling for and he wanted to check on me. I felt guilty about just that even though I already told him my situation with the phone and wanting space to get my head together (and this is why I’m finally getting angry bc SA and depression are the hardest things I’ve ever had to deal with and have limited me so much and he caused it yet he can’t respect it. I always try to not hold anything against him or attack him bc in all honesty I feel bad for the guy, he has to live with the reality of him being a deadbeat who ruined his relationship with his kids. But by trying to consider him, in turn I feel guilty). But then today he texts me saying he knows our relationship is broken but he shouldn’t be disrespected with these medical bills that I let accrue on top of being ignored and he disabled the insurance card. I texted him reminding that I can pay for it and said that I have anxiety that disallows me to answer the phone. I feel like it was forced out of me. He was the first person I really ever told that and I feel so called out and shitty like there’s something wrong with me. From him of all people. I get he didn’t exactly know before so I don’t know how to feel. I’ve been crying all morning. funnily enough I was supposed to go to the eye doctor today (lol). I had to beef myself up for it bc it’d be my first time going w/o my mom and I had a totally shitty night bc of it but I guess it’s not happening. After a while he texted back saying thanks for responding (as if I were just deliberately ignoring him) and he said it was the communication for him and I could’ve texted (I of course did) and that he’s sorry to hear that and to take care of myself and take it slow. Even the ending of that just is totally eating me up inside like he’s the last person I want to hear that from and I feel totally minimized and useless and I feel like that often, but I try to keep my distance from him and make it my business to not let him make me feel that way because he’s the reason I’m like this. I told myself that I’ll confront him when I’m well enough to defend myself and uphold my boundaries. That’s not right now and yet I’m here with these obligations. I’m 18 now and I take full responsibility of my life and my mental health and I’m getting better in my own time. I plan to go get help when I’m well off enough to provide it for myself and rn I’m feeling so exposed and for some reason and kinda like I’m holding onto my illness as something to hold against him and an excuse. Idk. The plan was always to confront our relationship once I’m well so that I can state my expectations and keep them in check, but rn I’m wondering if he even deserves that and do I even want a relationship with him ???? Or am I overreacting?? Am I wrong here??? I know this was a big build-up to what seems like a minuscule problem but this has been so hard for me for so long. It feels like ever since he left, the theme of my life had been “since dad left...” “daddy issues,” even like 7 years later. I hate him having that power in my life then to just feel responsible for this now. It’s just fucked up to me. Idk what I’m even talking about anymore or what the conclusion of this is. I don’t expect anyone to read this and I should probs be sending this to a therapist but she’s got no money or insurance so yeah (not that’d I’d go anyway, still very much avoidant :)))))",0

Every Friday I have to have a 15 minute private meeting with one of my teachers to check in and see how things are going for me in my classes. And every other Thursday, I have a speech session that lasts for over an hour with a teacher that I am not very comfortable talking to. I go to speech for my lisp and social anxiety and I just really don't like talking to teachers or people I'm not comfortable with about that stuff, but I can talk about it with my friends. I have my speech session in about 20 minutes and I am really nervous. I've gone to it two weeks ago and it was so awkward and embarrassing for me. Unfortunately it's part of my IEP so it's required.

I went to see a psychiatrist because i had been having lots of anxiety about returning to school since I had been at home and felt safe for about 6 months.

I never knew other people didn’t feel their heart beating so fast or sweating and dreading being around people until I told my best friend and she said I was weird.nnI play softball and I’m in speech and debate (basically I’m in acting) and I love it but it’s so hard with social anxiety. My psychiatrist told me that since I do these things most people with social anxiety wouldn’t do is what’s been keeping me sane. That doing those things we’re getting me through the tough days and choosing to not give up. That I had gotten used to that feeling of anxiousness. I thought this was normal. I cried so many nights wondering why I couldn’t make friends, and why I was so worried to go to school the next day, and why I would get scared 2 weeks earlier about going to a party. nnI’m asking how other people cope with it or even your experience with social anxiety or someone you know who has it. I need answers because I’m so confused on why I have this disorder and how I got it. I want to be able to go and do things teenagers do. This is my last chance at being a kid.

6623,"RDC47-11","post","Worst Psychiatrist EVER.","I am about to see a new psychiatrist but my last visit to one has got me beyoond nervous. nnAbout six months ago my LICENSED THERAPIST agreed with me that medication for social anxiety would be a good idea. My parents thought otherwise but my mom finally agreed to take me in for a consultation. nnThis guy was not on the referral list that my therapist gave to my mom. Instead, a friend of hers had recommended him. (I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same friend who recommended the new Dr. Doolittle 🤢). nnSo I show up and first impressions are not great. As we are walking into his office he asks me what I assume to be routine questions. Such as: have you ever experienced gender dysphoria. nnAnd I replied no. Because I hadn't. nnHe says something along the lines of ""thank God you would not believe how many of those we get. What a crazy messed up world we are living in now"" and laughs to himself a little.nnAnd Im just thinking to myself.. Im not transgender but I am bisexual? Probably shouldn't tell him that because he is clearly an unprofessional bigot. nnHe asks me what I am there for -and at this point I am almost visibly shaking and sweating. My anxiety goes through the roof when I am talking to an authority such as a psychiatrist. I was sure he could already see what was wrong because after all he was a medical expert- I tell him social anxiety. He asked me why I think I have it and my mind goes blank. I tell him in my hoarse, trying-not-to-cry-because-Im-stressed voice ""I have trouble talking to people. Social settings and school always stress me out.""nnThen he hands me a paper and tells me to check off whatever applies to me. The list was hardly any different from any online self test for anxiety I've ever taken. I mark some stuff off and hand it back to him.nnHe takes one look at it and has an ""ahh I see"" moment. Then he flips it on its back and draws a circle. He puts a triangle in it and says ""do you know what this is?""nnAnd Im staring at his stupid little circle all confused. And he says ""its a pie chart."" nnImmediately I feel a little dumber.nnHe points to the tiny triangle he drew in it and says ""this is how much of your problems are due to anxiety"" then he points at the rest of the circle and says ""this is how much of your problems are due to the regular wear and tear of life and adolescence.""nnAt this point Im sure he's speaking a different language. My anxiety is at dangerous levels and he is making zero sense.nnHe begins to talk down to me about how all of my problems are because Im a teenager. And every teenager has my problems. Then he looks to my mom and asks if there are any other teenagers in the house. She responds with my 13 year old brother. nnHe tells her to bring us both back in so we can all have a chat that will be really good for us teenagers. nnThis person spent almost no time talking to me about my problems. Then de-diagnosed me with a checklist. nnLittle does he know: I've had anxiety since I was 8 and ten years later my 18 year old self STILL has anxiety. So funny. Thought I would've outgrown it by this point ""Doc.""",1

I am not passionate about public health and only took it because I was lost and my parents were forcing me to do something. I suffer from social anxiety due to some negative life experiences I had. I haven't had friends in over 7 years at least and talk to no one except my parents and younger brother. Also I have never been in a relationship, I'm a virgin (makes me feel like a kid). I have never had any type of job, internship or even volunteer experience ever. I am super socially awkward. Like it's really bad. Sometimes I say things that make no sense If I ever do have a conversation with someone and regret it and think it over and over, which is why I just avoid people completely and honestly I am much more happier now. I want to eventually get into the coding and stuff so I will go for a masters in computer science but before that I want to take a year or maybe more off and just work a basic regular job and save money, gain confidence, so I don't rely on my parents all the time.

6627,"ksilenced-kid","post","Sudden Onset and Hindsight","Mostly just talking here but also welcome the thoughts of whoever can relate somehow. I don’t know if anyone remembers a distinct beginning to their anxiety; the funny thing is I do: I was a straight A honor student. Then in eighth grade I sat at the breakfast table, doing my homework - and all of a sudden I wondered, why bother. Why finish this assignment, and why keep trying to make friends or be happy.nnSo I just stopped- well, I couldn’t continue. It was seriously that sudden- I had energy and in a second I didn’t. It never returned; I mostly flunked eighth grade to sophomore year, because none of it seemed to matter. For so long I wondered: What caused that change?nnYet honestly? Looking back now it’s obvious. I was extroverted but had no friends because everyone thought I was a jerk. We also moved constantly. My family didn’t help things by telling me to focus on academics - but I had no social rewards to reap as a result of doing that, apart from a distant chance at wealth.nnMy parents wanted me to stay a kid, and to be ‘theirs,’ free from the poisonous influence of outsiders. They pretty much encouraged me to be a dick, telling me all other kids were assholes and I was better than them. So I treated others like shit while craving their promised acceptance. I was socially feral, not happy, and no one gave me a choice or permission to be happy or socialize, outside flinging insults and telling me my inherent ‘superiority’ would someday win and I would be justified.nnBut as ‘smart’ as everyone told me I was? I couldn’t see or understand that those stresses were probably the reason I shut down, until -decades- later. I blamed myself for the ‘eighth grade moment’ and got confused; or I blamed nothing, and got angry. But it continued; from that moment I stopped being able to verbalize, or socialize with others outright- alongside a number of other depression and anxiety related issues.nnI wish I could go back in time, back to when I still had the energy I had before eighth grade (which I never got back- and I’m 35 now.) I wish I could tell myself: figure out what makes you happy, while you can. Don’t just try to be what your parents want- And don’t listen to them when they tell you how much better you are than everyone. Listen to people; share joy with them, and stop doing things that make you miserable just because you’re told.nnMaybe then I would have avoided the trigger event- what was always a possibility from my chemistry/genes, but I could perhaps have staved off by being better taken care of when I was too young to know better. Or - maybe it was inevitable anyway and I wouldn’t listen. But 22 years later I feel the lost chance. I sought therapy/medical help and it never worked. No friends, no desire to make them despite longing for the idea. I had a few ‘good’ years but they were brief and ended very poorly, long ago. No family, no kids- Ugh.",1

I immediately panicked but I had to keep trying to park the car properly so I spent a good 5 minutes trying to get the car out again without making another dent. The dent popped back out. I finally backed out of the space enough to maneuver my car back in (but backwards) but this woman immediately came up to my car and started yelling at me all angrily which made me freak out even more. She wasn’t even the car owner. I had to force myself to calm down and not cry as I tried to park again in the same spot (no other spaces were open) and she kept yelling at me. And then ANOTHER random old lady started telling me I hit that car like I wasn’t clearly in the middle of backing into the parking space (to avoid the same predicament). nnI decided to just wait for the car owner to come out because I’ve never done this before and I wanted to ask the other car’s owner how this kind of situation works, and as I did so, the angry woman came back a few minutes later and started taking pictures of me and my car, saying that it was her friend’s car. She then went away again and came back in her car, stopping to take pictures of me and my car and the other car AGAIN as if she hadn’t just gotten it the first time. I was CLEARLY sitting there waiting for the car owner for a while. If I had planned to drive away, I would’ve done it way earlier, no??nnThe car owner was taking too long so I had to go inside a local store to borrow a pen and leave a note. I got a call later and the car owner was so much nicer &amp; perfectly polite about the whole thing. I’ve already paid for the repair and figured the whole thing out. Not once did she get angry with me, she just wanted the dent taken care of.nnI took care of the whole situation within 2 hours of it happening, but I still feel really shitty about the whole thing. I get triggered by people yelling at me, especially older adults, I got really scared because I didn’t want to get in trouble with my mother (who’s verbally abusive), and I got scared of how the car’s owner would react if her “friend” was that angry with me. I feel bad about how she treated me like a criminal and immediately assumed I was going to run off. I really hate the feeling of being photographed by some stranger because they think I’m a criminal.

I thought I was always being spied on 24/7. nnMost of the time it’s just a thought at the back of my head, don’t even notice it half the time. But that thought grows stronger when I’m left alone. I never feel like I’m alone, ever. I’m never alone. I feel like there’s always someone watching me. nnI either think the government is watching me from my phone, TV, laptop. I believe there are security cameras all around my house. I believe ghosts are around the house watching me, like the spirit of my dead grandmother judging everything I do. Sometimes I believe my neighbours are watching me so I make sure to keep quiet and make sure all the blinds are closed. I even believed that my friend’s cat that I took care of while she was on vacation was bugged and was watching/listening to everything I do while she was gone. Or I sometimes thought that my thoughts were being broadcasted or something so I made sure not to think anything bad or embarrassing. nnLike none of the mic/camera delusions are because I think people are out to get me or something. It’s always just like, security reasons. Bugging the cat so they know I’m not abusing it, cameras in the house in case there’s a break-in, government spying on me so they know I’m not a serial killer. I mainly feel like I have no privacy ever. nnIs this common for social anxiety or do I need to seek medical help? 🤪",1

People at work always seem to know each other better than I know them. They chat to each other on mobile, and outside of work. But I have no idea how to break into that bubble.nnI almost had my first ever date this Sunday. But the girl bailed, even after I spent a fair bit of money on train tickets. It has caused quite a severe bout of depression, which makes me wonder whether I should address my depression before dating.nnI also think my depression is steadily getting worse. I’m starting to lose interest in practically everything, even gaming, which is pretty much the only thing I do these days. I just sit in my room, and do nothing. No matter what I do or not do, it makes me depressed. nnI’ve had CBT for social anxiety, and it didn’t help.

Later on that week I decide with my money I would put myself in a situation that I didn't understand; buying food...I didn't say it was impressive, but just going to the chip shop was one of the most anxiety provoking things I've done in a while, hands sweaty an all. nnSo as I approached I walked in and even now I don't know how it exactly works but I just knew I had about £7 and had to quickly scan the board and order something while someone was staring at me, after ordering it I take it and leave, forgetting the change in a classic me fashion. nnIn hind sight though I keep ruminating that I walked past one of the people that's suppose to take the order at the counter since there was two people and I moved past the first as I just panicked and moved towards the one I could see staring into my soul. I've been back once again, it went better than the first time as there was much more people before me, and I was slightly more prepared. nnI know these all seem very basic but for me walking past someone on the street is awkward and hard, I'm very socially inept and anxious, this is about as much as I can talk to anyone, since I think I talk to slow in person and can't really verbalise my thoughts into words well, so my biggest fear right now is going to the doctors now or in the future by myself, anyone had this same anxiety, I get it cause of course I can't verbalise even menial things in person, let alone something personal to someone I don't know, any advice for this also was anything I've done good in terms of social progress for anxiety, I'm 16 by the way if that helps judge me.nnP.S, Definitely didn't post on the social skills reddit, nope could not have!...okay maybe.",0

A therapist a while ago recommended that I start taking anti anxiety medication and at the time I said no even though she kept trying to push it on me because I was and still am worried about how a general anxiety medication would affect me. But now about 2 years later I'm wonder if it's the necessary step in improving my social skills and getting me to a place where I can actually connect with people. My main fear is that taking an anxiety medication will lull me out all the time, so while I may be able to function better in social situations, my energy or alertness will also be sacrificed for all other situations where I don't really experience anxiety and my personality will change. I expect that the medication isn't just going to turn on when I have to socialize, it's gonna be ""on"" all the time even in situations where I'm not anxious. nnSo I'm just wondering if anyone had this issue, if they did find that taking medication was helpful or unhelpful, and how severe your anxiety was before taking medication and after.

I was wondering if anyone here can do activities that other people without social anxiety would think that someone with it could not do yet you can do it? For example, while at university or work, I have no problem asking a girl to go to coffee or lunch, however, if they asked after if I would like to go to a bar sometime or dinner or on a date my anxiety would swell up so much that I would just make up an excuse and avoid it totally.

Still, at other times I tip the other way severely. nnI met someone interesting at work recently who happens to attend the same university I go to. I was thinking of asking her to coffee on campus sometime, but I feel like there is this invisible wall in front of me stopping me from going past coffee or lunch.

6666,"Rip_Inevitable","post","Fearing it's too late","So I'm a 23M, and I've just had something of a quarter-life crisis. nnI've always been reclusive and socially anxious. I had bad experiences with other children when younger (fights, being chased, laughed at etc.) but through high school I had a good circle of friends, we were always doing things or playing online, people thought of me as funny and charismatic. Somehow I even came close to a relationship with a girl, but I was too scared to push further. nnHowever, when I was 17 I was diagnosed with Chron's Disease, and it really fucked me up. I was in pain a lot, tired and couldn't control my weight. Numerous embarassing symptoms emerged, medication made me sick and I became riddled with health anxiety. This was also the age where my friends wanted to go abroad, move out or go out partying, and although they asked me I was always too scared to go with them because of my condition. I didn't even think about moving away to university, and stayed at home with my parents and commuted to the uni in my hometown. nnI became a total shut-in. Alienated most of my friends, pushed away people who tried to become my friends and just worried constantly about my health. I remember visiting Pompeii with my parents, somewhere I'd dreamed of seeing, and *all* I could think about was 'what if this weird mouth ulcer is cancerous?' I was too scared to keep a job, too scared to pass my driving test, and too scared to attend the diminishing number of social gatherings I was invited to. I made one friend at university in the final year, it was 90% his effort and now he's moved away and joined the Navy. nnI got help for the health anxiety. I found a good therapist, got the Chron's under control and I've finally stopped worrying. In-fact I couldn't even see the word 'cancer' or any variation thereof without performing some weird OCD ritual. But with the fog clearing, so to speak, I've looked at my life and realised I've basically wasted 6 whole years of it; I have 1 friend left, who I rarely ever speak to, and who I think is tiring of trying to invite me places. I have never had a girlfriend or any sexual experience whatsoever. I have no hobbies. I'm overweight. I'm unattractive. I haven't had any adventures. I have no anecdotes to tell. I've been abroad without my parents once (school trip). I can't drive. I've had one job for a grand total of two weeks. I can't stomach the thought of moving out. I have no idea how to talk to the opposite sex. I can't even play online games because of the anxiety. nnI'm a fucking failure and I'm so, so, *so* lonely. nnI'm watching all my friends getting relationship experience, settling down, marrying, buying houses, starting families etc. I'm terrified I'll end up alone forever, and it's looking increasingly likely. Everywhere I look, from movies to books to songs to adverts to reddit to those strolling down the beach holding hands, people are happy in relationships together, and it's hard not to feel like the hunchback in the belltower. I have fantasies about being in a relationship; not even concerning sex but just cuddling with someone, laughing together, comforting eachother when we're struggling, and when they dissipate I find myself inconsolable. I just want to know I'm not totally worthless and that I can be loved. nn^(God, how fucking pathetic does this read?) nnI tried downloading dating apps and managed one date, which quickly went nowhere. Likely she saw how fat I was compared to my picture and told her friends she was catfished. Everyone on these apps has pictures of them socialising, visiting exotic places or working in exciting careers, and they're so many leagues apart from me I feel like Captain Nemo in the fucking *Nautilus*. Why would they be stupid enough to swipe right on a loser like me? Even if we do match I have no idea what to say, how to impress someone or make them laugh. And how do I take them for dates when I've hardly ever left the house and can't even drive? The only reason I was ever close enough to the girl in high school is because it was high school, we were literally forced to see eachother for six hours every day, where else can I replicate that now that university is finished and I don't have a job? nnReading dating advice I'm told to join clubs, go volunteering and make friends first, but it seems an equal number of users on forums tell me that they've still failed to meet anyone doing these things. Fixing my myriad problems would take years of effort, which I'm prepared to do, but even still the odds look so disparate it doesn't seem worth it. Even if I can become an attractive, well-travelled social butterfly at somepoint in the future, what woman is honestly going to shack up with someone completely inexperienced at that age? It already looks weird now. Besides, my anxiety would only mean I'd fuck up any intimate relations we did have.  nnIf you're still reading and haven't cringed yourself into oblivion, I don't know what this was for. More of a vent, but if you have any advice, or you can relate I'd really appreciate it.

I went to my local university for a major I thought I felt passionate towards, and only ended up finishing the first two years. I withdrew two years ago. I have never worked other than summer job programs that allowed me to work in places friendly towards my extreme anxiety (the animal shelter in my town). That's what I did this summer. It took all of my courage, but I worked at the animal shelter and made a bit of money. It felt good to get out of my negative, soul-draining home and be in that environment. Animals are one of the only things that relieve my pain.nn**Last year, my older brother took his own life** after battling anxiety, depression, and towards the end of his life, schizophrenia. He received no support throughout his teenage years as his struggles intensified. He completed high school online because he couldn't handle socializing. He lost his only friend after my family moved after the divorce. I watched him decline as his younger brother, but was not educated on mental health and completely unable to help him. My parents should have been there for him, instead, they pressured him about making more money and moving out. He was abandoned like I am now. He had nobody. He was pushed to the brink, and couldn't keep fighting. I failed him too. I carry this guilt and pain with my every day. On top of my issues, my brother's loss nearly broke me. I have kept going only because I know he'd want me to. But I'm growing weary, and not having family or friends who care has weakened my resolve.nnI've come to a crossroads in life now. My narcissistic abusive mother has decided that in order to ""cure"" me, she's moving into a smaller apartment to screw me over and cross me out. This apartment has no bedroom for me, and short of being homeless, I would be forced to live under her thumb at this place, with no privacy, no basic rights, no quiet. I am hypersensitive to noise and light, and having my own quiet bedroom allows me peace and security.nnOne of my major anxiety triggers is my father, who doesn't live with us, and I went no contact with. He visits every day, so for years I've had to live in my room with a lock to avoid him and not talk to him. My mother does not understand my suffering. She doesn't understand my anxiety or inner pain. She keeps deflecting when I beg her not to move, and tells me to get a therapist. She won't answer the FUCKING QUESTION of why she is moving and taking EVERYTHING from me. She is taking away my sanity, my peace, my only escape and coping mechanism for my crippling anxiety.nnShe is taking my way of life away, and being the narcissist she is, wants me to thank her for it. I believe her therapist told her to move to force me out, to force me into intense anxiety. What this move has done is force me to closer to the abyss. To the end of the road. I can't go on. I can't bear this anxiety, this pain, this grief any more. My family has abandoned me. I can't do this. I can't make it in life. There is no way for a failed person like me at 22 who has no job, didn't finish my college education, and doesn't even have a license or car to ever make it out. **I live in my room, and need a bedroom to be sane.**nnMy mother has taken away my options, my entire life. Up until now, my life has been online. I work online making a fair amount of money (not comparable to an actual job, but enough) to buy things, and was planning to continue my education online, which I always excelled in and preferred. Part of what led me to leave college was fear of my abilities in the harder subjects. I could have a perfectionist mentality that contributed to this too. I always wanted to do my best in classes and I was struggling.nnShe wants me out of the way. I don't open up about my inner struggles with anybody in my family, and have no friends. I have no support structure at all. Up until recently, my support was mainly my mother, who has turned her back on me. She's moving to a small apartment and if I move with her, I will be relegated to a corner without privacy or security. I forgot to mention that my father and mother have both in the past stolen from my siblings and I, gone through our possessions and violated our privacy. **This is also why I cannot live without a bedroom and a locking door.**nnI'm scared, everyone. There is no path ahead for me. In addition to my intense anxiety and depression, I could also have OCD and I'm not sure what else. What I do know for certain is that I can't make it on my own. I'm jobless with no prospects. I live in a state where you NEED a car to get anywhere, and I don't have the means to own or drive one. My mother has started laughing at me when I have gone to her almost in tears about my fear of her moving, and tearing my life apart.nnMy mother is moving in 2 days. I have been dependent on her for dear life, and now that is being torn from me. Without a home and a bedroom where I can work and live, I'm going to self destruct. I can't handle it. I'm going to break. I depend on my bedroom for stability and peace. I am so scared. For the first time in my life, I feel completely and utterly lost. I will have no escape from my father. I am so terrified of this new reality that I have had dark thoughts.nnPlease, somebody help me. Tell me how I can possibly survive this nightmare. I have nobody left in the world who understands. Even my brother, who I tried to reach out to, won't listen. They have all turned their backs on me and their only reply to my begging them to not do this are: ""Get help"" or ""You'll be fine."" I am lost and terrified. I am begging for your advice. nnI don't know how I can possibly find housing or work with my mental state. I don't know if my university (if I return) offers reduced/emergency housing. I don't know who to contact in the state to ask about affordable housing or help for someone like me who has nothing.",0

Each time was because my mom found out I was self harming. She only took me to the first session each time because they were free and then never did anything else. As time went on I got better at hiding all my problems. I think my family just assumes everything was “just a phase” and that I grew out of it. nnThe problem is I didn’t (obviously) but I don’t know how to get help.

6685,"Acwfxx","post","I’ve come a long way this year, here are some tips that are actually working.","Things I’ve changed that have shown improvement:nnHey guys, I’ve [20M] been trying to work on my social anxiety for a while now and I have finally worked at it enough to realise what is actually working for me. I used to spend a lot of time in this sub but drifted away to actually go and put the ideas to use. Despite having only moderate SA (shaky hands in public, couldn’t approach people, couldn’t talk to girls) I’ve made a lot of progress. I feel 10x more confident than I did at the beginning of the year which is a big achievement for me - I thought I was always going to be that way. Hopefully these tips help you guys.nn1. MeditationnnI’ve been meditating inconsistently for about 3 months now. Usually at least 4-5times per week if it isn’t everyday. I do it for about 10-30mins depending on the day and how busy I am. I highly recommend meditation just for general mental health but it definitely helps with social anxiety. For me it just allows me to step back and see my emotions/thoughts/feelings for what they actually are and stops them from consuming me. It isn’t a cure-all but it is a great tool when used in conjunction with my other tips. Focus on your breath and immerse yourself in the present moment.nn2. Similar to meditation. Mindfulness.nnLook it up and work on it. You can practise virtually anywhere and having it in your arsenal is a superpower that not many people have. Basically it will help you stay out of your head and keep you in you surroundings which is key to beating social anxiety. nn3. Reduced the time I spent in headphones or on my phone.nnThis ties into the idea of point 2. I was addicted to listening to music, not healthy 100% of the time. nn4. I stopped smoking so much weed.nnWeed basically trapped me in my own head and made me very self conscious every time i smoked it. This wasn’t a direct choice relating to my SA, but ever since I stopped I’ve been far less anxious is general. I’m not saying weed is bad by any means, I used to smoke a lot and my friends still all smoke, but for me it made me paranoid and anxious so I stopped. I only smoke very rarely now, its not for everyone. Don’t do things that make you feel like shit. nn5. JournalingnnAgain, not a choice directly related to beating SA but I think it has been one of my contributing factors. I do it every day now. I just jot down any thoughts/ideas or anything that would otherwise keep me up at night. This allows you for a clean slate when you go to bed and wake up. I feel like I worry less now. Also, at the start of every entry I write something that I’m grateful for, its just a small positive thing so you have a bit of gratitude for something every day. Also I feel like I’m practicing the skill of writing everyday which makes me feel better about myself. nn6. A controversial one, but I was microdosing LSD for the best part of 2 months. nnI wouldn’t recommend it for everyone but if you are familiar with psychs (like I was) and have done research it doesn’t hurt to try it. I would recommend Psilocybin though. Microdosing helped give me a different perspective on my thoughts and emotions as-well as making my days a little brighter and more engaging. nn7. There is no substitute for exposure therapy.nnExpose yourself to uncomfortable situations. I went from being one of the quietest kids in the lecture room to the one that the lecturer calls on when no one else is putting their hand up. It was simple. I asked questions. A lot of them. At first it was really fucking scary but you soon realise that those thoughts are completely irrational and 99% of the time the consequence is only positive. No one is thinking about you as much as you’re thinking about you, don’t place so much emphasis on social interactions. Do small steps everyday. I started saying hello and goodbye to my bus drivers to and from uni, small but goes a long way. I strike up small talk with shopkeepers when I can. Always be polite and genuine. To me Exposure therapy is all about showing your brain that these situations have less negative consequence than it thinks. Don’t believe everything your brain tells you. nn8. Act like the person you are striving to be.nnStart telling yourself that you’re that “social guy/girl”. Tell people that you’re quite social and outgoing (don’t blatantly make up stories or lie though). You’ll be surprised how this affirmation to yourself and others actually translates to reality. Become that social person.nnAnyways these are just worked for me but I’m sure others can benefit. There can be a lot of unnecessary stuff in this sub but I know these tips can get results because I’ve experienced them. Have a good day everyone.",0

I would be happy if you'd take a moment to give your oppinion.nn&amp;#x200B;nnIm 25 years old and have always been in a stable environment, be it family, job, friends and relationsships and in general i am a happy person. What has been haunting me for the last 10ish years though was a medical condition that (i suppose is the reason that) made me worry about how others perceive me. I didnt notice it, because it didnt interrupt my daily life. In December i had a sort of breakdown because of that condition and felt so stressed and constantly agitated that i once again went to the doctor beause of it. this was also the first time that i realized that there may be something wrong with how stressed out i get over holding a meeting etc. but i blamed it on my general state of mind at that time and forgot it soon after.nn&amp;#x200B;nnShortly thereafter, finally a solution was found and my condition that plagued me so was cured. so theoretically i should have nothing to worry about anymore.nnBut somehow my brain/body seems to have it imprinted that i still feel nervous/anxious when speaking in a meeting, meeting a bunch of strangers or holding a presentation to a point where i feel almost numb.

It doesn't matter whether we have been friends for years, I still can't make myself feel comfortable in their company. It's driven me to a point where I can't see a ny meaning in life because I can't form meaningful relationships or truly connect with anyone. I feel like I'm stuck in a bubble and I don't know how to get out. CBT and medications haven't worked for me (I still see a therapist every week since 2 years back, but with no progress whatsoever. I might add that I'm also diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder, and possibly have undiagnosed PTSD. A traumatic event at age 13 spurred me into a vicious cycle of endless mental issues and I still, 8 years later, suffer from it). nnI still live with my parents (can't get a job with the virus raging and I dropped out of school years ago). My family are really the only people in the whole world I can be completely relaxed with. Everyone else, including relatives, make me tense up. I do my best to mask my insecurities and I've been told I come off as pleasant, and sometimes even funny, despite being a little quiet. I do realize the issue is mostly in my own head and most often people don't even realize how anxious I feel on the inside, but that sensation of pure dread whenever I'm put in a social environment is absolutely awful. I feel so lost and inadequate compared to others. Socializing makes me so anxious that I get overwhelmed by it and end up breaking off relationships because I just can't stand being so close to anyone. Intimacy scares the hell out of me, so romantic relationships always end abruptly with me ditching the other person to get out of the situation. Sex is a mechanic act that for me involves no bonding or emotions of any kind. Hell, I'm starting to think I don't even have emotions. If I do, they're so deeply buried under my anxiety that I can't feel them. There is only room for shame and self doubt. I am so sick of feeling this way. And nothing seems to help. God, I'm so lonely. nnI do have people in my life, including a loving family, at least one ""close"" friend and a band, but I just can't enjoy the latter two.

My only understanding or view of mental illness (until I was 18?!) was the word ""crazy"" and the image that is often portrayed by Hollywood - people screaming and being violent etc, often in an asylum setting.nnI remember none of this, but as a child, apparently my teachers have always pointed out to my parents that I seemed pretty ""anti-social"" and quiet. My kindergarten teacher once asked my mother if I had autism, and my 5th grade elementary school teacher also spoke to my mum about my unusual quietness and ""anti-social"" personality. Also growing up unaware of mental illnesses other than the classic TV portrayal, my mum thought nothing of it and chalked it up to me being a shy child.nnI've always experienced pretty bad anxiety (mainly social anxiety), especially when I had to go for school camps, or school orientations where we'd be grouped with strangers and generally expected to be active and excited etc. I'd always experience the dread, the choking feeling in my throat, the heavy weight on my chest, the nausea, withdrawing into my own head, and feeling as if I'm underwater. Of course I never thought of this as anxiety, I just knew I was scared and that I wanted to run away no matter what. I never knew how (still don't) to make friends properly, or how to approach people. And whenever I do approach someone and make some sort of conversation with them, if I see them approach another person without me, I'd always think ""oh they prefer to talk to each other, I'm gonna have no friends"". It's obviously irrational and stupid, but I always ended up feeling awkward, antisocial and friendless, and worse - like I was viewed as such.nnTo that end, when it comes to things like orientations or camps, my extreme anxiety often led to terrible nausea, and I'd ultimately just end up going to the doctors, getting a medical certificate and skipping those few days. This is despite the fact that I knew I was only going to the doctor's in order to be able to skip school for those few days, but the nausea made it easier for me to convince the dr. nnBut most importantly, because I was afraid of being viewed negatively, I never told anyone about how I felt, what went through my head, or what I experienced. So no one ever knew about my anxiety.nnForwarding to the present, I now live in Australia, and having been exposed to a society that (more) freely talked about mental health, I was able to identify my experiences as unusual, and only recently managed to get myself diagnosed(?)* by a clinical psychologist as having social anxiety disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and depression. Under my psychologist, I went through about a year of monthly/bimonthly CBT and mindfulness-based therapy. And more recently, I have also taken up medication.nnI have tried citalopram (Celexa), mirtazapine, and now venlafaxine (Effexor). The former 2 was only taken short-term (a month each) as they were changed by my GPs, plus mirtazapine made me too groggy to function. Effexor was the only one I've tried long-term (a year).nnn#####nnNow, the problem here is, I've always coped with my anxiety by avoiding situations that causes it where I can. My first clear memory of myself experiencing anxiety was when I was in 4th grade, although I'm sure I've had it since I was a lot younger, and even then, my first instinct was to avoid and get out of the situation. After more than 10 years of avoidant coping techniques, it seems to be ingrained in me right now.nnCBT and mindfulness doesn't seem to help because I always know that my ""logic"" was irrational, and I knew that for e.g. it's fine if I don't do super well at work especially when I jsut started, but the point is, despite knowing these, I still felt the dread anyway. So when CBT is used to challenge my thoughts, it doesn't seem to work for me because I already know the correct logic, I just still feel anxious.nnI also haven't been able to see any change since I started taking Effexor and am now doubting its effectiveness. Granted, my external situation's been pretty stressful and uncertain, so my depression's gotten worse and I've been avoiding social contact for a while now. So if it was in fact effective, the accompanying regression in my current situation would probably have negated any progress made.nnSo my question is, to anyone who has experienced social anxiety since childhood and has ingrained negative coping mechanisms, how did you overcome it? Did CBT work for you? Another question would be - should I request to get on a different medication?nnI've been reflecting a lot and realised that I had regressed pretty heavily, and am hence seeking advice from the community. Hope you guys don't mind the text wall! Stay safe ❤️nn##### nn*Not sure if I was ""diagnosed"" as she only mentioned that it seemed like I had these disorders, and while I know for sure that I do have those disorders, I'm still unsure if that counts as an offical diagnosis.nnn_________________________nnTLDR: to anyone who has experienced social anxiety since childhood and has ingrained negative coping mechanisms, how did you overcome it? Did CBT work for you? If not, what did?nShould I request to get on a different medication if I don't think my medication helped at all (even after 1 year of taking it)?",1

6710,"Talarurus","post","I (23M) recently reached some sort of breaking point and went on my first spontaneous date/hookup and it went surprisingly well","Really long story ahead but it covers a bunch of issues I struggle with (SAD, AvPD, insecurity about looks,  maybe even body dysmorphia, not dressing how or doing what I want out of some subconscious fear of ""expections"" others have, alcohol, loneliness, craving deep connections with people, body contact, not seeing yourself in a relationship...) so maybe others can relate. I guess I also just like writing long posts lmao. The middle section has a TLDR at the end.nnI’ve never dated, had a boyfriend or been intimate with a man (or other person in general), I basically also had no friends for most of my life post-childhood. I was bullied a lot as kid and I’ve had social anxiety since I was about 12 and probably have avoidant personality disorder too (r/avpd), though I don’t care much about the labels. I didn’t know about AvPD until recently and reading some of the experiences of others the past few weeks has been eye-opening and incredibly helpful at identifying what’s wrong with my life. I've basically been living in a self-made prison half my life (as I've seen somebody write) and ""social anxiety"" only covers some of the experiences and issues I have, I feel. Perhaps this story fits better into r/avpd because I feel like folks over here actually often turn out to have partners and be married and such, which always baffled me (before learning I probably have more than SAD). But then I also don’t want to minimize having a personality disorder, guess I’m overthinking things again.nnNot sure why I'm even sharing this story - I guess to share something positive, to show that most of our worries and insecurities are totally made-up, and that we are actually capable of doing the same things as most people? My life has been a complete mess up until now (because of SAD/AvPD) with no sign of improvement until recently, so if it seems like I managed to do this because I only have “mild” SA or something, that’s totally wrong and I wouldn’t mind sharing more about my life and experiences in the comments. I basically spent my entire teenage years and then my student years alone in my bedroom with zero human interaction outside of school hours, no exaggeration.nnI guess I’ll get to the story. Again, there's a TLDR at the end of the middle section.nn____________________nnI've been studying in this city for almost 3 years, because of covid I haven't been there often -  I've basically been homebound since March 2020, except for some lab work and exams. It's not like I would have done much anyway because of my SA (and likely AvPD), so I would have regretted not doing anything during this period regardless of the pandemic. Last week my last exam took place and after finishing it I realised this would officially be the last ""relaxed"" night in the city and in my studio before packing and leaving, which hit me kinda hard - I basically regret my entire life, I regret not doing anything, I regret turning down invitations, I regret not meeting people or not getting closer to the people I met, and this also applies to the last 3 years. So many missed opportunities to do things or become friends with people I feel I’d get along with. This regret has only been growing with the years (fueled by 2 years of near-total isolation because of covid and losing some loved ones), and the last few weeks I've been thinking *a lot* about my life (and I've started doing therapy again). I went my entire life believing I’m an extreme introvert but the last few months/years I’ve started to seriously question that (and many other things about my life). Anyway, I prepared a nice meal after my last exam, picked a good movie and opened up the bottle of wine I had bought a couple of weeks earlier, I guess for this occasion.nnWhen I'm a bit tipsy/drunk (2-3 glasses of wine and I only do this once every few months, don't worry) all my anxieties and insecurities go away and I feel mostly happy, it's as if this self-made prison in which I otherwise live just vanishes. I think this was actually part of the process of realising I'm not who I've fooled myself into thinking I am. I only drink by myself though and I did it for the first time rather recently, I think out of some kind of fear of what I would say/do around people that I otherwise wouldn’t. I’m sure that if I drank around others I’d just be a “normal”, social person. nnAs I had done often before (just to look around with an empty profile) I downloaded Grindr. I got chatting with this normal looking guy who texted me first, and he eventually convinced me to sent a photo of myself. That might not sound like a big deal, but I hate being in photos and how I look and as a result basically no photos of me exist after the age of 13 or so - I have never uploaded a photo of myself to facebook or something either. It was a selfie I took a couple weeks earlier in a new outfit I haven't dared to wear yet, because it’s not what I usually wear or some other stupid reason - my wardrobe if full of things I like but have never worn. I actually thought I looked decent in the photo (at least conscious/rational me thinks so if that makes sense). He said I was cute, had nice eyes and had no reason to be so insecure/anxious (which I again consciously believe, I jus't don't *feel* that way). Despite my lackluster social skills I'm pretty good at reading people and I felt this guy was ""safe"", and I was just so lonely and deprived of affection (or just human interaction in general, I'm not very close with my family and hadn't seen my only two friends in weeks), that I asked him if it was OK if I came over just to talk/cuddle. He said that sounded great and that he was too tired for more anyway, which I assured him wasn't a problem as I wasn't interested in anything sexual (for real, I was just looking for company).nnI still can't believe I did this but I brushed my teeth, got dressed, hopped on my bike and went over to his place. By this point I was actually fully sober again - the biggest and hardest steps (sending the photo, putting myself out there, setting a date) had already been taken. He was waiting at the entrance of his dorm and we went to his room. I immediately felt comfortable and at ease around him which is fairly exceptional, he just had that vibe I guess. I feel inferior or intimated (not sure what the best word is) around maybe 95% of men around my age so I guess I had some luck there. Perhaps I also just reached some kind of breaking point where the regret and loneliness got bigger than the anxiety and things holding me back, or maybe it was still the wine.nnWe talked for about an hour, I actually opened up about my anxiety, how this was my first time meeting a guy and so on. Though he couldn’t believe why a guy like me would be anxious he could actually relate because he was like that as a teenager (or so he said), and he was extremely supportive - he also complimented my eyes, hair, body and some other features and he was totally genuine about it (again, I consciously believe these things and tell myself them, I just don't *feel* it). I'm actually mostly good at one-on-one conversations I think, it's when more people are involved that I completely freeze up. Eventually he asked if it was OK if he me gave me a hug (which I hadn't dared to ask yet), I said yes and oooh boy.nnA couple days prior I actually wrote in my diary that I could never see myself having a relationship or being sexual/intimate with someone, and that because I’ve been single my entire life everyone just “knows” me as the single guy so I’m “supposed” to be single or something I guess. It just didn’t seem like something for me or that I could see myself doing or initiating. The rare times I’m out in public by myself and I see others with friends, a partner or family, everything seems to come so “naturally” to them and it seems like they don’t care at all about what’s happening around them and that *hurts* and always gives me an overwhelming negative feeling. But I’ll continue now…nnWhat followed was a whole lot of firsts over the course of two hours (though we stayed fully dressed) and I'm honestly shocked I did the things I did. From basic hugging to gently touching and kissing each other, to staring in each other's eyes uninterruptedly for minutes, to tickling each other and eventually french kissing, then the same things but laying down facing each other. It was wild and honestly felt like a dream afterwards, I genuinely have never felt as good as that night and the hormones that got released had me smiling for days. Mind you, I’ve never been physical with people like this, even my family was/isn’t really big on hugs or anything (though they're good people). He never did anything without asking or me making clear it was OK and I felt like we actually got some chemistry going on, so I have zero regrets this happened with him (and not with a first actual boyfriend). I was extremely awkward and passive at first (and couldn’t maintain eye contact for more than 10 seconds or so at the start) but by the end was doing most of the things he did. Eventually it got really late (or early), we hugged each other goodbye and I went home. For me this was a one-time thing (I’m leaving the city anyway) and for him this was a casual thing he does regularly with different dudes (as he had already told me at the start), so that was it.nn**TLDR**: I've been extremely lonely and isolated my entire life, especially the last two years. It was my last day in a city as a student, I had huge regrets about never doing anything, never meeting anyone and never getting close to people (this had been going on for months/years), and had a nice relaxed evening by myself with some wine. I also mentioned some of my avoidant behaviour, insecurities and other thoughts I sometimes have. I downloaded Grindr, sent someone a photo of myself for the first time ever after chatting for a while, met up and we talked and were physically intimate for hours. nn______________nnI feel kinda bad about writing these things because I don’t want to make anyone jealous or feel bad about themselves, nor do I want to brag lol. But I guess my point is that I had never done anything with another guy for 23 years, was convinced I’d die alone never having even touched a guy and then this just… happened, in the moment, going with the flow. And it was a totally memorable night and not a catastrophic failure. Maybe most people are actually nice, and maybe I’m not as weird, special or incapable as I subconsciously think I am? Perhaps behind that layer of anxiety, insecurity and restraint, there is actually a “normal”, loving person waiting to break free? When looking in the mirror I guess I also *feel* a tiny bit of self-esteem for the first time now, since that night I’ve noticed I just look a bit “different” when looking at myself. I guess I also see myself having a relationship in the not too distant future. Really weird how one experience can change how you feel about yourself, in a positive way for once. It actually really messed with my head for a while, I felt totally attached to him already (which I guess is a normal physical reaction) though I realise now that I’m just so deprived of affection that I got attached to the first person that gave me some - I don’t really get hugs from family either, and then the entire covid situation the past 2 years took away daily interaction with fellow students as well, though that was superficial.nnI largely still ""feel"" the same internally as before but I actually see myself dating or just meeting new people in general now, which I guess is a huge step forward. I’m not sure how actual dating, having a serious relationship and sharing everything with someone will turn out though, this was just a fun night with no strings attached. My issues haven't just vanished overnight.nnI guess “just doing things” isn’t going to work as advice for most people (it doesn’t for me either and reading positive experiences here always seems so alien) but I guess I reached some sort of breaking point and I managed to turn it into something positive rather than something negative through a series of fortunate coincidences.nnI contemplated posting this for a while and might delete it later, but fuck it. I've been thinking a lot about life lately and writing things down is nice.",1

6712,"Necessary_Number","post","weed therapeutic effects","some of you should give weed a try. Its really what **helped me the most**. This tip is directed to people who have weak sa but still feel like they are not living life to the fullest. Be aware of the risks, some people get **psychosis** for life when smoking for the first time, some people smoke and are stoned for weeks before they get back to normal. To clarify, thats something that happens to very few unfortunate people but since its very scary I feel like I should tell you right away (do your own research tho!!). Something that happens to many people though is that your anxiety **might get worse** when smoking and I know some people personally in which this is the case. nnBut I still think you should also know the **chances** that can come with it. Personally I smoked daily for many years now and it has a huge therapeutic effect for me. I really want to underline how it just was the missing part for me. nnNow, if you have decided to give this a try, I recommend a few rules: At first, consume very small amounts. It is common that you might not feel anything at all when smoking the first few times; dont smoke more, really start with only **2,3 tokes** inhaling right into your lungs. Also make sure you are in a relaxed state to begin with. Again: If you dont feel anything, DONT smoke more, maybe add one toke the next time. Now, if you feel it and it helps, keep in mind that you still have those problems, go to therapy, its not a long time solution. Last, but not least, **limit** it to an amount where it makes your life better, but doesnt have huge negative effects on your life. For me, I smoke multiple times daily-you should not do that. Since it has nothing less than unbelievable effects on me, I am addicted. Be aware of this possibility as well. The **addiction** is not super bad, its a joke compared to cigarettes. Which gets me to the last risk; Smoking is the form of application which I recommend, because you can estimate how much you consume way better. This should not be a trial and error game.nn&amp;#x200B;nnAfter reading this you might be asking yourself why you should even do it if there are that many risks and disatvantages. What I really want you to take away is that there is a fair chance that your **sa might be completly away** when stoned, you are just relaxed. Not the same as alcohol at all - its therapeutic, really, for me. Kinda emotional how much it has helped me. nn&amp;#x200B;nnAny **questions** related to weed, hit me up!",0

I believe it's because of my anxiety disorder. nMy therapist doesn't seem to believe that I'm burnt out, and he's known me for only 4 hours (4 sessions) and says that I'm tired because of my anxiety and fear of failure. I agree with the anxiety part but I don't like him dismissing the idea that I'm burnt out. I know that he's a professional but I also know what I'm feeling. nNeedless to say, I feel drained. Like the lemon skin after you've pressed the juice out of it. I'm so tired all the time. I also looked into having a slow thyroid, and I also suspect that I may have this. Of course, the symptoms for this medical condition can be applied to a lot of other diseases as well, and only a blood test can verify the suspicions. nEither way, I'm not in a good place. One of the lowest of my life. nThis whole ordeal basically resulted in me not being able to perfom well at school. I know what laziness feels like and this isn't it.

I mean, my therapist didn't really help and I don't know what the cause of my burn out is, and now if I really even have one. What if I'm making this up? What if I'm just pretending?nBecause this project is so sternly assessed, people only get extra time when they have a GOOD reason. I have nothing to support my claim. I also feel bad for the teacher because she is very nice and I don't want to disappoint her and burden her by coming with this issue 2 weeks before the deadline.

I’m also so anxious that I’m having a lot of trouble meeting and talking to women, and I’m a 21 year old with a severe lack of sexual experience because of that. I think it’s because my confidence is non-existent and I don’t know how or where to get it. I also think I’ve been desensitized because I’ve watched too much porn/masturbated for the dopamine and happiness that I never feel anyone. To add to that, huge nicotine smoker (vaping) and smoke weed every day. I’ve been in therapy for about a year and a half now, I know it’s a super long process, but I feel like I’m getting worse :( I feel like it’s really interrupting me from functioning normally in life right now more than it ever has. Thanks for listening",1

I’ve always been a anxious person however at the age of 15 I was officially diagnosed with major depressive disorder as well as general and social anxiety, my anxiety was at the point that it was hard to leave the house without crying and having a major panic attack because of this while other teenagers were getting their first jobs and becoming financially stable I was going to therapy and trying to learn how to cope with my anxiety. At age 19 I found out that I also have bpd, however I really wanted to try and get my life together and found a job and was hired as a assistant manager at a family dollar. Daily I was having mental breakdowns and panic attacks so after two weeks I quit because it was just too much for me. I came to the conclusion that anything working in retail or having to interact with the public was just not going to work for me at least at this point in my life. Recently I tried again as I’m 24 and really need to get my shit together so I was hired at amazon however I had the same problem again and also quit there. I feel ashamed of myself as I want to be a contributing member of society but I just have no idea what to do and feel stuck. nn*TL;DR* I need suggestions on what kind of job a very anxious person can do with almost no previous experience. nnThank you in advance for anyone willing to help.",1

I actually think it’s beneficial to do presentations since it’s forces me out of my comfort zone and to confront some of my anxiety, but getting points taken off because of my presentation performance just seems... wrong. nnFor my final presentation in my sociology class that’s worth almost 20% of my grade, I’m penalized for using filler word like um, ah, etc..., going over the time limit by just a couple seconds, stuttering, etc... nnI have diagnosed social anxiety and I literally can’t control my throat feeling like it’s closing up, me starting to hyperventilate, or using filler words.

6731,"DoerThinker","post","2021 12 Month Challenge!","Since the new year is approaching, I figured I'd create a challenge for you all! Sometimes self-improvement can really help when it comes to social anxiety. nnI'm already in a very similar process at the moment (I post a progress post on my profile every day if you want to check it out). The reason I say this is to say that the purpose of this post is simply to give you all some ideas on ways you can improve yourselves in 2021. The power of incremental improvement is amazing.nn**January: Setting a Wake-Up Time**nn* The four pillars of health are sleep, fitness, healthy eating, and having a good social life. Let's work on fixing your sleep first. Before focusing on a consistent sleep-time, it is key to work on waking up at the same time every day. You get to pick a time, but make sure that it is relatively early. 8 am is an excellent choice, for example.nn**February: Setting up a Seep Time**nn* Now that you are consistently waking up at the same time every day, you might have noticed that you might be tired some days. This is because your sleep time might not be consistent. 8 hours of sleep is a good target, but if you feel that it is too much or too little you can change it. Your goal here is to be in bed at the same time every night. It might help to also set a time for when you need to get ready for bed. A night routine might take time and shouldn't be rushed.nn**March: Performing Deep Work**nn* Now that your sleep is fixed, you might notice that you have plenty of extra time during the day. You will use this time to indulge in at least 1 hour of deep work per day. Deep work is defined as an activity performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. Writing, studying, and coding are some examples. You can also spend your time producing your own content. The book ""Deep Work"" talks in detail about deep work, and the difference between deep work and shallow work.nn**April: Hitting the Gym**nn* Now that your sleep is fixed and you're working on your brain muscles, it's time to start working on your actual muscles. The goal here is to go to the gym 3-5 days per week and perform strength training. The book ""Bigger Leaner Stronger"" is a great book that talks about this and provides a workout routine. Also, don't forget to stretch after your workouts! We don't want you getting injured.nn**May: Doing Cardio**nn* Now that you've successfully worked on creating the habit of working on your muscles 3-5 days a week, the next goal is to add cardio into the mix. You can do this after your workouts or you can do it during your rest days. Cardio can include running, swimming, hiking or even walking. The goal is to have 2 sessions per week. HIIT is also a good example of cardio. A good idea might be to do HIIT one day and to do low intensity cardio another day.nn**June: Eating Healthy**nn* Wow, look at all your progress. You're going to bed at the same time every night, you're waking up early every day, and you're working on your brain and on your physical muscles. Now it's time to focus on what you're putting into your body. You will start eating healthy every day. Less carbs, more fruits and vegetables, no deep fried food, no unnatural foods, no unhealthy preservatives, no soft drinks, lots of protein... the list goes on. Furthermore, you are to drink at least 2 litters of water per day, as water is also a big part of nutrition. There is a lot of information online about what constitutes as healthy eating. The book mentioned above is a good example. You can still eat food that tastes good. Chipotle, for example, tastes amazing. Another example is dark chocolate. You can by all means have a couple pieces of dark chocolate with your tea. The more proper research you do, the more you'll understand what is healthy and what isn't. The goal for this month is to implement a healthy lifestyle.nn**July: Taking Social Risks**nn* The first three pillars of health have already been talked about. Now it's time to do something about your social life. Your goal here is to take 1 social ""risk"" per day. This can be something as simple as texting an old friend and asking if they would like to have a phone call to catch up. This can be something like asking a cute girl/guy if they would like to get coffee with you. This can be something like sending an email to an old professor and asking how they've been. This can be something like asking your friends if they'd like to hang out during the weekend and setting up a plan. The goal here is to get busy socially and to get in contact with more people.nn**August: Teeth Care**nn* Wow congrats! You are a healthy person now. You are working on strength training and cardio every week. You are eating healthy. You have an amazing sleep schedule. You have an awesome social life. You are performing deep work every day on projects you find interesting. Next up, it's time to work on preventing future health problems. The best way to start this is by working on your teeth. The goal here is to brush your teeth properly twice a day and to floss once per day. You can watch videos on YouTube if you'd like or you can set up an appointment with your dentist. You are to no longer half-ass your teeth care. I want you to have the cleanest set of teeth out of everyone.nn**September: Skin Care**nn* There is a great subreddit on the topic of skin care on reddit. The three pillars of a beginner routine are to have a good moisturizer, to have a good cleanser and to have a good suncream. You are to go to that subreddit and learn how to create your beginners' routine with those three products. Then you are to purchase those products and apply them every day in the manner that is set out in your routine.nn**October: Meditating**nn* Wow look at you! 9 amazing habits so far. You have transformed into a better version of yourself. But you're not done yet. Next, we will work on calming your brain by meditating every day. There are some great meditation apps, such as Headspace and Calm available. The goal is to divide the month into 4 parts. The first week, you do 5 minutes of meditation per day. The second week, 10 minutes. Third week, 15 minutes. Finally, on the last week of the month you do 20 minutes per day. After the month is over you can return back to doing at least 5 minutes per day moving forward.nn**November: Limiting Phone Use**nn* The next goal is to limit instant gratification. We live in a world where we are constantly plugged into the internet and into our smartphones. The best way to tackle this issue is by starting with what that is often most used, and most unhealthy - your smart phone. You are to set a 1 hour limit for each day (unless of course you absolutely need to use it for work or for an emergency or something). The point is to limit the use of apps such as YouTube, Instagram and things of that nature on the smartphone. You can spend your new time on things like reading or other hobbies.nn**December: Helping People**nn* Look at you! You have become a healthy individual. Now it's time to help others! You are to perform one act of ""helping"" per day. This can be something as simple as giving money to a homeless person. You could also go on subreddits that talk about depression and suicide, for example, and direct message a user who is going through a hard time. There are numerous ways we can be kind and help others. Your help and kindness must be genuine here. You goal is to take a little bit of time every day to be kind and to help someone.nn**Final thoughts:**nn* It's amazing how much progress can be made in one year simply by focusing on one habit per month and then by adding a new habit the following month. There are many other habits that I wish I could have fit into this 12-month plan, but I believe these 12 are the most important for people just starting out. There is, however, one habit that needs to be mentioned. This is the habit of taking care of your finances. During the year, when you are focusing on the 12 habits mentioned above, make sure to keep this one in mind. Make sure that you are being smart about your purchases and that you are learning about money management, and things like investing and saving. With that being said, I wish you all all the best in this journey! Remember that you don't need to use this exact plan laid out. You can make your own changes. I can't wait to see you come out the other end of 2021 as improved individuals!",0
6732,"DawDP","post","Aniracetam completely eliminated my social anxiety! Where has this been my whole life!?","I must mention upfront that this IS NOT AN ADVERTISEMENT.  I made a somewhat similar post in r/socialskills and the only reaction was that it was an advertisement...  It was not.  I'm 21 years old and I've been suffering from social anxiety, ADHD, and PTSD for years.  The other 2 conditions only make the social anxiety worse, and the social anxiety makes the PTSD worse so it's like a big neverending circle.  I've already been prescribed Wellbutrin and Hydroxyzine which definitely help a lot more with my mood/temper rather than my social anxiety.  Anyway, I stumbled upon this nootropic called Aniracetam a couple weeks ago.  I took my first dose of 750 mg with 300 mg of alpha gpc(needed to prevent choline depletion) and went to work about half an hour later.  Oh my!  I suddenly didn't care what people thought.  It's like a light switch!  I felt more assertive and powerful, and didn't have to think hard about what I was going to say mid conversation.  Words just flow naturally without too much forethought.  Not only that, my jitters and word stumbling from ADHD were gone and ALL MY SYMPTOMS of PTSD were gone.  I felt like I wasn't even remotely the same person.  Someone even jokingly asked me if I had a ""brain transplant"".  My confidence was so through the roof I was almost cocky.  I'm hesitant to call something a miracle drug, but if I had to, this would be the one.  I'll never recommend a substance or drug to someone without doing the research and asking your psychiatrist, but this one is it for me.  Ive already noticed mild permanent effects already, as I went to work without it recently and the confidence/flow of words were still there; but the jitters, mild word stumbling, and PTSD/irritability were also still there unfortunately.  I'd honestly say it's completely changed my life.  Has me wondering, where has this miracle drug been my whole life?  I wish I found it years ago!",1

Fast forward I called school and told them I was sick. So today my teacher approaches me and tells me that she is very disappointed of me that I didn't tell her anything beforehand and wants proof that I visited the doctor, otherwise she will make me fail that presentation. Now, I didn't visit the doctor since I was not actually sick and neither am I officially diagnosed with SA, so I basically already failed. But that's not what I really worry about. I have been trying to put together an excuse E-Mail full of lies (I was too sick to visit the doctor; I actually told her the day before that I am sick but I missspelled her E-Mail Address and that's why she didnt see that I told her...), but at this point I am simply sick of lying all the time in regards of SA. Maybe I should just tell her that I was simply too afraid? Since I already failed that presentation I might as well be honest, right? I just worry that she might think even worse of me as a student and that I simply ""came up with that shit"", and that ""you can't have that as a 17 year old, like just grow up already"". So what do you guys think? Would you tell her the truth?",0

The term SA is also kind of thrown around casually these days which definitely waters down the seriousness of more severe cases that people face",0

6742,"Necessary_Number","post","toolbox for social anxiety","I've been to therapy for a couple months now and my sa is by no means gone, but I think I can give you some tips which help. The good thing is that some you can apply immediately after reading this. You don't need a year of training or so to use them. nn1. Breathe: When you are scared you tend to cramp up and you can kinda work against that by having one or a few deeper breaths through your stomach. This one is really good before social interactions, because your voice will sound stronger. Also, it really is the start of a conversation that sets the tone for the rest of it. n2. Drop your shoulders: Speaking of cramping up, there are many things that happen to your body when you get scared. You should definetly research muscle relaxation techniques. I picked this one because for me, it is the most effective. The big advantage compared to the first tip is that you don't have to think actively about it all the time. You can keep it in the back of your head. Having your body in a more relaxed state generally is a good thing, because it releases positive hormones which makes your thoughts more positive and also your anxiety becomes less obvious which of course is great.n3. Thoughts: Now I come to the cognitive part of anxiety. A thought that really helps me, because it is true, is that nobody really cares about your mistakes, they mostly just care about what they are doing right or wrong. Takes a lot of pressure. n4. Try not to hold a grudge against people: Since you have social anxiety, other people will try to take advantage of it. Holding a grudge at someone is like drinking poison and expecting the other person will get killed. Try to find peace with idiots.n5. The most effective tip I have is to look at people. Only then you know what people are thinking. Don't be a weirdo about it, but just try looking at people more than usual for you. It really works against these thoughts about yourself which can be pretty harmful.nn&amp;#x200B;nnSo, when I get anxiety, I really decide out of my stomach which techniques I am going to use. No technique for itself will work every time. You can combine techniques. These tips probably won't change your life, but they at least gave me options to fight social anxiety.",1
6743,"meippon","post","I have severe work anxiety.","Hi. Like the title says, I (20F Korean-Canadian) have severe work anxiety. To give you some background info to understand my situation a bit better: nnI moved to London, UK, at the beginning of this year for work. I graduated culinary school in Baking and Pastry Arts, got recruited by a famous 5 star hotel company, and moved to London at 19 alone. In the beginning I was excited. But as soon as I moved there things were very difficult for me. Turns out the UK is more different from Canada than I expected. I was culture shocked and formed agoraphobia. nI worked for around 2.5 months and then this pandemic hit, so I was in lockdown/quarantine for 5 months. All alone in my one room. I guess that’s where my fear started growing. I constantly thought about my skills and how I worked. I always felt like I was the only one that lacked skill in both baking and in being social and active at work. I never got to become close with my colleagues because of the short time, but also because I am very introverted. Everyone in the kitchen seemed so professional, passionate, and friendly with each other except me because I’m very new. I constantly compared myself to them. I felt left out the more I thought of it, not because of them, but because I felt alienated. Like (literally) I was really a foreigner. I’m the only asian person and also the youngest, everyone else is older than me by 10+ years, so the cultural and generational gap felt so big. I was alone in the world with no family nor friends to come back home to after a hard day. I was so homesick. nnSo because of all this, I basically spent my whole time in lockdown torturing myself and my mental health by thinking of all the things I lack, the things people at work would say/said to me that probably meant nothing but I overthought, I would think that everyone hates working with me because I just suck, and most importantly thinking about what the main executive chef thinks of me. If you know anything about the food industry, you would know it’s one of the most stressful and pressuring type of work for all physical, mental, and emotional health. Because of these self deprecating thoughts, I thought I was going crazy. I cried everyday and night. nnThen later on, the chef called me and said I would have to come back in for reopening work soon. I had a major anxiety attack thinking of going back to work and being in that pressuring situation again. nThe day of the reopening came and I was at work. I could feel my brain going haywire. I went to work for a week during reopening and I cried every morning and night going and coming from work. I dreaded going to work and I was so stressed and anxious constantly that at one point I threw up near the time I was supposed to close. I left early that day and just sat in the train and started bawling my eyes out without a care if there were other passengers or not. I finally decided to get help. I talked to my doctor, got diagnosed with GAD, depression, and OCD. I called my mom to tell her what happened and she immediately said to take a holiday and come back home. I decided to contact the main chef while crying and he said to take a couple days thinking of what I want to do. I got a doctors note saying I am not suitable for work and to take 12 weeks off. So I did and also booked my holidays, and came back home to Canada. nnPresently, today is my last day here in Canada. I was supposed to return to London December 23rd, because that’s when my holiday ends. But no. The hotel management contacted me and told me I need to be in for work on Christmas. I told them I would be returning the 23rd, and will have to quarantine for two weeks when I arrive. They said I can’t and need to be at work for Christmas, so to rebook my flights so I can go back to London, quarantine, and be at work on Christmas. I was so shocked because I already got approval for my holidays before I came here, and they all know that we need to quarantine when we come back. I already dreaded going back to London because I was so happy finally after long days of mental exhaustion from work, seeing my family and friends and stress free. But when they said I need to come back ASAP I felt my heart literally shatter. Told my mom about it and started to cry and rebooked my tickets. Even as Im writing this post, I am anxious thinking that today is the last day and I will be on the plane back to work tomorrow. nnYou may be thinking, if it’s that bad then just quit. But for me, quitting is something I don’t want to do. I was the one who begged my parents to let me go and I am the one on this career path. This hotel is a very well known name in this industry and can get me anywhere and more opportunities in the future. My pride is too high and also I don’t want to disappoint my parents because they told me to just bare for the last year (my contract for work is two years), which I do agree on. nI just think that if I have some less working time, I will be able to manage myself better. Which is why I’m thinking if I should ask to reduce my hours in half, instead of working full time everyday. But I also don’t want my pay to change because I don’t want my parents to find out I am working less after taking 12 weeks off from work, and also I would not be able to afford rent. But at the same time I’m not sure if it would change because my contract and payment states I am receiving money salary wise, not hourly. Does that mean no matter how little or how long I work, I still get paid the same? All these thoughts are in my head and I don’t know what to do. I want to go half hours but if the pay is less then I would have to continue full time. But then I would not be able to manage my mental health. nnI really feel alone in this because nobody around me my age is working, and are having fun with each other in university, partying, eating out, having money from their rich parents. It makes me feel as if I am alone dealing with “adulthood” while my friends can, obviously not relax (because I know uni is also hell), but can at least be here with each other :(  nnThis was long, thank you so much for those who read until the end. Please let me know what you think I should do.",0

6745,"Necessary_Number","post","how to actually battle social anxiety","I've been to therapy for a while now and it's kinda eye-opening how much you can actually do to battle sa even in the short-term. nnShort term: Breathe, keep an open stance, look at people, if you start thinking about yourself you can get out of this by thinking about the other person. These things mastered which might take you only about a month make a huge difference. I often hear that there are no shortcuts, absolute bs.nnLong-term: Go to therapy, try to find out about your social problems which often come with sa, for me it was being kinda rude and stuff. Use drugs the smart way, I would not recommend not using them at all, bc you need your positive experiences. Learn to master more simple things like talking to an employee while staying relaxed or not getting scared in public before thinking about more complex topics. Keep a journal where you write down your positive experiences, I would not recommend including negatives since you tend to focus on them a lot more anyways. nnEverything sounds impossible before you make it. But I think most people would be surprised how fast and major improvements you and I believe everybody can make if you just stop feeling sorry about yourself.

Every time I try to explain my mom why I isolate myself when people come over, she brings up the fact that I have social anxiety and that I hate people, even though I did not say that whatsoever. Anything I say is wrong in her eyes, I feel like she has this stigmatizing notion of people with mental illness, including SA, that anything they say is completely wrong. It is extremely frustrating talking to her about my SA, anytime I list my reasons for not talking with people(which is a fear of rejection/embarrassment), she continually says that its because I hate them. I had situations in the past where I thought certain people hated me/thought ill of me, so I think that's where she got this from.  Ive overhead my parents one night talk about my issues, and they agreed that it was because of bullying. I find this ridiculous and untrue simply because 1. I have not been bullied(save for few experiences), and 2. They wouldnt have known anyway.

6750,"Aromatic-Bridge-4046","post","[M24]My struggles since early teens! (must read)","Hey everyone!nnI will write informally like I always do talking to friends! I have suffered with BDD since around the age of 15 and has been horrible the last 2.5 years. I am now 24. Miraculously, I am getting much better since I had started a new therapy 8 months ago. I just need to work on my thoughts and if that works out I will finally be cured! My thoughts are my worst nightmare, they cause intense anxiety. I personally call my anxious thoughts as past or daily traumas that feed from the major traumas in the past. Thankfully I got my first appointment in a few days at this psych I really wanted to go because I really beleive that will help put an end to all this curse. Lets jump in to the cause of the anxious thinking. I have an intense fear or being laughed at or humiliated therefore I have isolated myself! One of the few places I visit is a barbershop and that is like asking me to go to the warzone xD. My family and friends always tell me that it is almost impossible for me to be laughed at espescially because of looks. They say I am way too handsome. It is not just them, I do get so many compliments when I go out. I believed I was so hedious looking which made me the ""ugliest"" ""funny looking"" in every crowd. But so many cant be lying to me, I have very honest people in my life who do advise me on some other flaws. I always days where Id see myself so ugly and after a couple hours Id see myself as handsome, this happens to this day. That is why I am not sure what is wrong with me that causes people to laugh! I got to the point where I started to also believe that I have some major brain damage such as low IQ and such which led to taking an IQ test where I scored 115. When I talk to people that know me about these stuff they think Im insane.nnNow you did get some idea of my struggles and thank you so much for reading this far! I am now going to talk what my thoughts and past traumas are that hold me back.nnI was bullied in junior school and only had a couple friends. Outside school I was very sociable and had many friends and honesty an awesome childhood! In high schools early years I was stil bullied but 2 months after I was first in high school I had lost my mother from cancer, myself being almost 13 at the time. After I got through that hardship I became sociable and pretty confident. I had more friends but still had ""haters"" for some reason. I would almost go out with friend and class every weekend from the ages 15 till i had graduated high school. After I graduated high school I started many different online businesses which had made me a couple millions in numbers but since then my motivation has been a dowhill and havent started anything else the lasy 3 years. I will explain the reasons why, it is very paingul for me! I had met wannabe gangsters and got so badly influenced by them. They were doing drugs including cocaine. The innocent me got into it and messed up! I always say I was at the wrong place at the wrong time :(. The last time I did drugs was with this people about 2 years ago and I had seen them mocking me and secretly laughing at me which has truly killed me. Since then I think everyone is and was laughing at me since I was a child. I have seen people laugh and point at me, I have seen others stare at me in funny ways for example when I drive and someone drives from the opposite direction. Could most this really be in my imagination? I could keep writing and writing but that would take forever haha.  nnSo my main question is why would someone laugh at me? It is out of jealousy or what? Am I actually ugly? (I have a post at the sub ""amiugly"" go check out how I look like at my profiles post)nnPlease ask anything if that helps you understand my situation better. nnThanks so much for reading friend! XnnP.S  My apoligies for any mistakes, I had a long day lol 😊",1

I had met Y before, and he seemed like someone I would keep as a Snapchat pen-pal, or distant friend type. So, “Sounds good to me, I’m sitting in the corner.”nnI wait at this bar away from most of the patrons. I wanted to distance myself due to the state of the world. Alongside, the fact I was just hoping to have one my normal rendezvous with X.nnThey get there, I’m reminded of Y’s name, he pretends to be a dick as a tactic to make friends. Yada yada. I’m a drink in at this point, and despite me being a lightweight I’m not feeling it. I order another, and X starts to keep an eye on my drink count. I begin to vibe with the music and tune out. Y begins to flirt with the waitress, and ask me if that made me uncomfortable. He thinks its funny that I’m a nerdy type. I tell Y that I don’t understand how that could make me uncomfortable, in fact, if he wants to turn the conversation over to me I’d take over the flirting. I wasn’t born yesterday. However, flirting always cause my social anxiety to flair a bit, as I monitor my tone and speed of speech.nn**Having Y there meant I couldn’t be so deep and personal with X. X knows this, so he says, “I keep telling OP here to take notes on you flirting, he still hasn’t gotten over his first girlfriend.” I was sipping on a Jagerbomb and almost choked on the Jager as a bomb went off in my head.**nn*Did he just say what I think he said? I don’t want to know what comes next.* My brain’s internal monologue screams. *WHY? I just wanted a drink, not a therapy session. Definitely not to be reminded of one of the few people I’ve loved.*nnI am now locked into this conversation. I want to escape. X can feel the 12 ft barrier I just put up. I noticed my own change in body language as I crumpled inward. Using my jacket as armor, my arms as supports, and my more relaxed persona as a shield. I could tell this was going to force me to become close with Y wether I liked it or not.nnY goes into a rant about how his first cheated on him with a whole sports team. How she laughed at him for loving her, etc...nn**X assuring me “you don’t have to if you don’t want to.” My secret comes out. Something that destroys me through embarrassment. I wanted to get up and leave. I wanted to go to my car and cry. I thought I could trust X. I thought he understood how my emotions worked... (I’m tearing up writing this.) This time my wall goes to 20 ft, I break all eye contact with everyone, lean back to get farther away. If X didn’t know he crossed a big fucking boundary, he certainly did now. I slowed my speech to a crawl to avoid showing emotion best I could.**nnY plays it off, and goes into how he wouldn’t be embarrassed. Yada yada. *Typical human relating technique.*nnMy attitude for the rest of the night was so distant X was getting worried he just killed our years of friendship. I just wanted to leave. I regretted my choice to come in the first place. I stopped at drink 3 and was not inebriated at any point. X insist he can drive me home, while I just refuse to leave with him, and I can make the 30 minute drive back to my flat.nn**Y leaves, and X begins to apologize profusely. I assure him I would have stayed quiet if I wanted too, but in the back of my mind what X just did, broke my greatest tenant of friendship, trust. My most embarrassing secret came out. I had an emotional reaction that I did not think still remained. More importantly I now have no choice, but to see X differently forever.**nn**I guess, I just need some opinions, some guidance on how to get over what X did to me.

I honestly don’t remember anything up until 5th grade when i moved schools and i spent everyday hoping the library was open because it was my safe space where i felt like i wasnt being judged for not being able to make any friends. Talking to people and being able to connect felt so hard, just living began to feel hard. Half way into the year we moved across the state because my mom was sick of my dad and this time i told myself i would make friends no matter what, and i did, i never connected but i made “friends” until 8th grade i was fine but this year in particular hurt the most i felt like everyone knew how much of a loser i felt like. All of my friends were online so when i went to school i had no one and i didnt know how to initiate conversation with someone or become friends. No matter how hard i tried to talk to people and connect with them it never happened. My life felt so meaningless. High school was a bit better with its occasional bumps but college broke me entirely. nnThis year especially is when i learned that everything i experienced wasn’t normal. Its not normal being afraid of walking on the sidewalk alone. Being afraid of people thinking that your a loser for literally going out for a walk/ jog isn’t normal. Being afraid of ordering food or paying at a cashier because you might embarrass yourself isnt normal. Literally panicking at thanksgiving and crying to yourself because your not sitting next to a family member youre not comfortable with is not normal. Getting angry at the people you love because you cant do these simple tasks you know they could easily do isnt normal. Theres so many things i see now that i do that have just become the way i live and learned to accept because i thought everyone had to just push through and do it no matter how much distress it caused them. I just thought everyone was way better at coping than i was until i finally broke and couldnt even try to cope anymore and tried to figure out what was wrong with me so i could start to look for the help i needed to make sure i didnt lose anymore relationships/ life experiences because of this. nnThis year i have to seriously consider dropping out because i could no longer handle the stress that came with it, a lot if things other than SAD had to do with this but the fact that i couldnt join my classes because of the thought of embarrassing myself in front of everyone in my online classes was too overwhelming and i got too behind for me to even keep trying. I thought that everyone was going to know how many classes i already missed and tell me how irresponsible i am and that i need to be trying harder and i dont belong in that university. I know not a single student in any of my classes cares or even knows who i am but i had so many thought keeping me from the classes i wanted to pass so badly. And it didnt help that in my almost two years being there i made a total of 1 friend that i dont even talk to anymore the whole experience was just the most depressing thing of my life.nnI mean till this day i still havent been diagnosed because i dont even know how to approach that ive never been to a physician or whatever and im too afraid and scared idk i just hate always feeling like a child even though im 19 years old. Idk how relatable this is but i just needed to vent this out i just feel like my life is constantly spiraling and stagnant at the same time if that makes sense and im so tired of it all i just wish i could think and act like someone who isnt anxious about every little thing and can just act and not think about it or regret it and just keep moving forward without a care in the world. I just feel like im drowning constantly because i never make the right choices and idk how i can correct the wrong ones. Dhchfudbdj",0

As extroverts, they don't understand how someone would rather stay inside than go out and socialise.

(which they don't want to accept because they are the type of Christians who believe that the devil causes mental illness.) So the fact that I am 'giving into the SA' by staying in instead of socialising means I am giving in to the devil.

Until late October were my bestfriend met with a girl we both went to school a few years back. On Halloween I also met her again and really liked her. Because my Friend only wrote with her on Snapchat I thought I could do the same. So one day after Halloween I downloaded Snapchat and began to write with her. I still don't know how I had the courage and strength to do that. But it went really well and at the end of November I told her that I had feelings for her. And surprisingly she said she also liked me and wants to get me to know better. So we had 1 Date and the very next day we had our second date were we watched a movie and cuddled (I usually don't like when people touch me or body contact, but when she was in my arms it was the best feeling ever). So after that we began to write with hearts and we wrote every day with each other. nnSo last Wednesday one day before Christmas we had our 3. Date. I gave her my Christmas present and she had also a small gift for me. Then I asked her if she wants to be my girlfriend. And she said yes. Then at the end we tried to kiss but we both never kissed someone so it was kinda a mess and we both said we will try the next time again. It all seemed to good to be true. And it was...nnAt Christmas it began to become kinda weird. We hardly wrote. And she stopped using hearts. So with my anxiety I immediately thought something was going wrong and asked her if everything was okay between us, she said yes. We wanted to meet on Saturday but the girlfriend of her father got Covid so she had to go to quarantine for the next five days. So we talked on the phone for 2 hours and everything seemed fine. The next day she called me again and said that she never had any feelings for me and hoped to develop some but it didn't happened. She said that it could be panic because of the divorce of her parents she is with love and feelings very careful. And she thinks about everything and we talk again today. But I think it's over. nnI never felt this shitty. My anxiety was never that bad. I don't know what to do and what to say. I can't eat anything. I can't listen to music anymore because it's sounds like nothing. Every 10 minutes I start to cry. I had the hope that now everything gets better. Early December I started to go to therapy. I was so ready to give her all my love and affection that I never got in my life. But to lose his girlfriend after just 5 days is just so pathetic. I really dont deserve true love.

It’s just sad.nnIn 2021 I’m realizing how long it’s been since highschool. How long I’ve been trying to impress people and act how they want.nnSo I need to switch my focus this year. Instead I’m going all in with exercise and developing a cash savings, and dropping my obsession with having a social life.nnI’ll hop into a voice chat every now and then with that online group and talk to coworkers, but I’m not going to put a lot of energy into it. I’ll focus on getting myself situated and let socializing come naturally. When I’m in a better spot then I’ll start reaching out to people again.",0
6773,"MattLP2001","post","Why I have no friends","Hello. Im going to take you back nearly 20 years to 2001. 2nd March 2001. The day I was born. The day I, a simple, pure, unpainted canvas was put on to the world. A baby, someone who needed love, care, attention and guidence. Paitenece and understanding. But a baby who would never recieve these things. nnSince I was a very young child, my older sister, born August 1999, was always my parents favourite child. She got everyones attention. I took the blame for anything wrong she did, and she always felt the need to hit me, to make me do shit because she couldnt be bothered. And dare I say no, or defend myself.nnMeanwhile, In school, I was the odd child out. I didnt like sports, I never understood the other kids, I always so sensative. So I never had many friends. My sister had all the attention and she loved it. She had the strength to do it I guess. Primary school was the easiest it ever got for me. Easiest it would ever get for me. nn2012. I was 11 years old, I started high school. And since the day I did, the kids saw me as an easy target. Bullied each day because they knew no one would stand up for me, and I didnt have the guts to stand up for myself. So I'd sit there and take it. Trying to impress my father back home, but he would tell me what a bad son i was, that I was useless. nnOctober 2012 my mum moved out and my parents split. I discovered the most of my childhood my mum was an alcoholic and my dad was a physical abuser. My mum used drink to get over it. My dad lost his punchbag, and who was left to take the punishment? Me. But he was never physical. His punishments came mental:nn""You're pathetic"" ""You're ugly"" ""No one will ever want a family with you"" ""No girl will ever love you"" ""No girl will ever want to look pretty and impress you"" ""You're a mistake"" ""You're not my son"" ""I'd chuck you through the window, except it means something to me"" ""If you dont find your coat, dont bother coming back at all""nnWords I will carry like scars for the rest of my life. I was still getting hit by my sister, and she seemed to find it funny that kids bullied me in school, as she was popular she ahd influence and would spread things about me, people would bully me for shit that wasnt even true. It was hell, I was awake until I passed out each night to have a few hours in which I could be me, or at least try. I had tried to kill myself a few times at this point.nn16th December 2014 I decided to run away from my dads and live with my mum. The 17th 2 am, I did just that. I remember the cold concreate and the muffled sounds of my tears as I sat on the pavement free. At 4 am and a police ride home I got to mums. The morning came and I awoke, he and her were on the phone. He didnt believe I was scared, I gripped that phone and told him. nnMy dad was always perfect to my sister, so she never understood why I ran away. So the bullying got worse at school, I started to self harm and she cut contact from me and my mum the following Feburary. A few months after that he started shouting abuse at me from his car whilst I waited for the school bus, in the end we got a police restraining order against him.nn2017 came. I stopped cutting, focused on my college. Discovered the band Blue October, realised I wasn't the only person feeling these things. That you could get help, medication to feel normal and happy. Went and told my mum, who told me I was copying the lead singer, and that I was fine and normal. Something that she sticks with to this day. nn2019 I started my uni course. That November my mum tells me shes back in contact with my sister, which lasted a week, it threw me off the rails and I fell into a deep, deep depression. I failed my first year as a result. July 2020 I had a breakdown, told my mum I failed and the reasons why. She shouted at me, one of my biggest triggers. But she says she cant help, its just who she is. Yeah, sure. nnI was allowed, at last, to get help from the doctors, diagnosed with depression and anxiety, given medication. My mum still told me I was making it up. That September I moved out. I realised this was my chance to sort everything as much as possible thats broken with me. That inclsued the hallucinations. Of course my mum hated it.nnThis breakaway due to Covid and the added independence of battling these conditions lead me to want to be more alone. And my mum didnt like it and tried controlling me. It was adding pressure and making me feel suicidal as hell. So I chose that I wanted December just gone to heal myself. To get better. My mum hated this, she couldnt possibly not talk to me for a single month and influence my every decision. She always tries to convince me not to get recorded help. I clearly need it. nnMy nan, her mum, decided to get invloved. We agreed my mum wont contact me unless its responding or an emergancy. Inreturn I send 2 weekly texts so she knows Im okay. Fair deal. This lasted on her end for 2 whole days. very frustrating, it then worked for about one week. Then I had my psychiatrist appointment. nnI was told I have mild schizophrenia likely brought on by childhood trauma and isolation. The psychiatrist prescribed me antipsychotics, as our deal I tell my mum.Who ignored me for an hour and ahlaf and told me the meds were gonna kill me, make my head blow up and make me fat. She yet again tried to convince me to not take the meds, after trying to convince me to cancel the appointment. nnI told my nan, grandad and aunt, my only other family left. They're even fed up with my mums bullshit behaviour towards me. I feel so alone, unloved, unwanted and unworthy. I just want friends, a place to belong, a place to be me. A girlfriend to love, cherish and protect, and her do the same to me. But maybe I'm not worthy. Maybe lifes not for everyone.",1

Also, wondering how the pandemic has affected people who've come far with social anxiety? nn**Here's my story of overcoming social anxiety for those who might be interested:**nnI've had social anxiety for as long as I can remember. Although, I didn't know that my troubles with socializing had a name until I was in university. Until this point, I believed that everyone hated me and I struggled to make friends and have normal conversations. I deeply loathed myself and felt like I would never be able to chase my dreams. The negative brain chatter ruled my life until several years ago (I'm 25 now). nnI started to improve when I started mindfulness meditation. It allowed me to distance myself from negative thoughts and gave me a sense of calm in social situations. Shortly after I started meditating, I did a 3-month exposure therapy program. IT CHANGED MY LIFE. I went on to travel the world and pursue my dream of becoming a wildlife biologist. I felt freer than I could have ever imagined. I connected with people easily. I could talk to anyone. I felt on top of the world! It really felt like I had finally overcome my anxiety. I mean I still felt the anxiety but it didn't hold me back. I loved myself and allowed people to love me for the first time in my life. nnI did all of this while in university and for the most part without medication. I did eventually start taking medication a couple of years ago after being properly diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD. The meds helped me feel even more calm and confident. Over time, I had become so chatty and good at small talk that I was utterly shocked at how far I had come. nnAll was good until about a year ago. I had been out of uni for about a year and was working a part-time job for lack of finding a job in my field. I started feeling so depressed that I couldn't take care of myself or get out of bed. I was able to function pretty well socially but I derived no joy from being around people. Shortly after the pandemic started, I quit my job and moved in with my parents. Shortly after that, I quit all of my meds cold turkey. The social anxiety has slowly gotten worse since then. It actually got to the point where I just felt stunned and paralyzed around people. It was like my brain stopped working. Meditation didn't help me anymore and I couldn't hear my thoughts even if I tried. I tried doing exposure therapy again and it didn't help either. nnI'm back on meds now but it doesn't seem to be helping much. I feel as though I'm back to square one with my anxiety. I can't talk to people anymore and I feel so awkward. It is making me want to retreat into a dark hole so that no one has to see me this way. I hate myself again and it's devastating to feel this way after having come so far. I feel stuck and hopeless. nnI guess I'm wondering if anyone else has had an experience like this where they've made a lot of progress with overcoming social anxiety only to be knocked back to square one? I'm also wondering if this relapse is not also largely due to being limited by the pandemic? Or tied to being unemployed? I'm just really looking to relate to someone because I really feel alone in this.",1

6794,"Fabulous-Advantage","post","My social anxiety","I have bad social anxiety, but how can I address it? I saw several therapists, one said I have it, the other suggested meds and exposure, but later dropped it. nnI don't have any friends, just acquaintances every now and then. I tend to offend people I feel like too. Never had a girlfriend, too unconfident/kinda lonely to put effort. I get nervous around people because I feel like they'll see me as awkward, or like a guy that doesn't socialize, or whatever, and I don't want them to feel uncomfortable. I get really nervous before meeting someone, or before talking about something but I do fine in the meeting.nnOnce I went around complimenting people, it was received well, though I may have come on too strong for some people. Started feeling unconfident later since people were out with friends/family and I felt lonely and I didn't have anyone, but didn't want anyone to know, since if they knew they would get close to me and find out who I really am, just a lonely person who doesn't hang with people and doesn't do that many interesting things but likes to think and write, listen to music, read self-improvement. I am interesting, just not socially. nnI lived in a house with 5 others I didn't know and I forced myself. I was too scared to go downstairs so I would spend an hour or two distracting myself before I was like ok, you're going to go downstairs and no matter what they think just know what you're doing. I was overthinking things like oh if I go down and cook something, what if they are in the kitchen and I have to not make it uncomfortable otherwise they would feel pressured to let me cook. Or if I bring food down, they're going to judge me for eating the same thing, or wonder why I have it in my room. Also I had a table there and I was worried they would judge where I put it, or take it apart, or judge me when I eat, and I would rather eat in my room, but I was worried they would see me take it up and judge me for being weird, or then start bothering me. Or I was worried we would small talk and I would have to tell them I wasn't doing anything except just reading, thinking, working a bit, etc. To not seem like I was in the house for too long, I would go outside and just take walks and sit outside for hours. When I got back I would hope noone ask me where I was, since I wasn't anywhere. I didn't want them to think I was alone all the time. I got through almost 2 months of this. nnI also got a position as a resident assistant on campus and it bothers me a lot, since I don't want to be seen as awkward, scared, or have people realize that I actually couldn't support them socially since I struggle more there. I do send the info out but it feels really contrived, since I don't want to be seen in more detail. I also don't want to put that I want to meet them because I don't think I can handle that.            One time I force myself to greet everyone I met in the hall but I felt like it made some uncomfortable or it came out wrong. One time I met one in the bathroom and I forced myself to ask him questions but I feel like it came too strong. And it was awkward too but I felt like he, who's couple years younger, was the one trying to compliment me since he said I got a nice haircut. nnI had wanted to quit and did tell my supervisor, but then I figured if I do just the requirements it's ok...but then I do feel like my residents can be kind of annoyed, or see me as a boring person who can't make things exciting for them (since I struggled myself throughout) like other people. I do try to let them know some of the events but I feel like they can tell I don't care. I don't think they are oblivious to the fact that I avoid letting myself be known more and stay in my room. I just hope they think it's cuz I'm busy, not interested, rather than cuz I'm scared, I am a couple years older than most of them. Tired of being different.nnSo yeah, I've got along fine, I guess.",1
6797,"Big_Shift5101","post","I (24M) have become a social outcast of my own making","I (24M popular kid) fucked up four years ago, deleting my social medias at a low point in my life (I was duped into the fantasy of the whole ""living off the grid"" meme, that it would increase my productivity, that it was a total waste of time, that I didn't need anyone's approval etc.).nnI was 20, had been very popular in school, high school, music school, scouts, my community and now early college, even throwing house parties, but paranoia from mixing adderall (for ADHD) and marijuana, being kicked out of university for bad grades/depression and a failed romantic relationship (and unfortunately being brainwashed by the redpill) led me to sadness/paranoia/suspicion about everyone around me. I especially started seeing all women as the enemy, and I felt the need to isolate from everyone for a while, making the fatal decision of committing 'social suicide' by deleting my medias.nnI cannot retrieve the accounts as they were hard-deleted (twitter, instagram, snapchat). It's been four years and I don't know how to return/ if that's even a good decision. I had a following of about 600 people on instagram alone that had grown organically over the years.nnHow do I recover from this? I no longer feel seen, no longer feel like I belong to a community, and feel like a ghost of my former bubbly self. I have objectively faded into obscurity. I know I am still physically here, just I don't exist on the internet, and thus in some sense I don't exist at all.nnI've basically disappeared and ghosted 90% of the people I knew. I did my own thing, stopped using adderall, got fit for a while, and was in therapy for two years which seemed to help.nnThen my therapist died a month into the pandemic, which was very traumatic on top of these other traumas.nnI am still continuing my education while in therapy (I am thinking of becoming a therapist myself), but now that it's a pandemic I feel more isolated than ever without at least the superficial connections of social media. My mental health is at an all-time low I must confess. Loneliness and a feeling of being a total anti-social outcast is slowly killing me.nnI still have 5-10 close friends that I did not alienate.nnBut I fear over the years I have lost relevance (99.9% of people I know uses social media), and I don't know if I will ever/could ever recover from this. I basically failed at ""maintaining appearances"" and feel like a fraud; I have to start over, as it were. And given my tanked status, I fear people will not want to associate with me/this could be a red flag when it comes to finding a relationship.nnFor the time being I have been reaching out to people from my high school and college individually, even meeting up, in order to rebuild trust and understanding. This has helped somewhat with giving me a sense of self again.nnI appreciate any advice.nnMy idea for remaking an Instagram at least is to begin with an art channel (I draw and make music as hobbies) and then turn it into a personal one as it grows. But just the thought of everyone having to watch me return and that it won't be the same makes me feel so much anxiety. I also have a physical disability which makes things harder as I have body-image issues.nnPerhaps I will never be on social media again, and I am trying to cope with this new reality of mine.",1
6800,"dawnfire05","post","Is this social anxiety? Misanthropy, a trauma response, or even paranoia?","I consider myself as having a fear of judgement and embarrassment, which I've read that's what social anxiety is. I'm terrified to let my mask down and be myself. Every second around people, even family and people I'm close to, it's like I'm putting on an act. I'm the person *they* want me to be, because in my mind they will become dangerous and hostile and abandon me if I show any sort of authenticity. It's just I don't know if viewing others as a *threat* is social anxiety. I've grown to hate other humans out of fear, of social interactions and being around them, pretty much everyone, because constantly in my mind they're judging me and their judgement leads to emotional abuse and abandonment of me. I hate people because they hate me first. At least my fear brings me to that conclusion. But I've also read that a hatred of other people isn't social anxiety and just misanthropy. I mean I want friendships and to be close with others but I just can't let down the feeling that everyone is a potential threat to me. Even people who generally agree with me, the moment there's a sliver of disagreement my guard goes up 100% and I shut them out of my life because in that moment they become dangerous to me. nnI don't know if I can ever ""just stop"" viewing people as a threat. My emotions are so extreme. Even if, in a way, logically I can tell myself ""they're family they love me"" (or insert friendly relationship) I just don't emotionally feel that way. I guess I want to stop feeling this way because I want a meaningful relationship with someone, but at the same time I just can't stop thinking they're going to be a threat to me and emotionally hurt me so it just doesn't even feel like it's worth trying to stop hating other people and social interactions. It feels like if I do that I'll be lying to myself, making myself vulnerable, opening myself up to their danger and then they will take advantage of me and use me and hurt me. To me anyone is capable of being a threat so that makes everyone a threat. It's just impossible for me to see any other way. I know that there's a mental illness clouding my judgement but it feels like even if I get therapy and medication that won't stop everyone else from wanting to hurt me, judgement and opinions of me are just objectively going to happen. And to me a judgement is a threat. So I guess I don't want to be this way, but then I'd feel like I'm living in a fantasy world. nnI feel like the people around me are constantly surveying me, paying attention to me to find things to judge me for so they can hurt me. Every tiny action of mine, every little sound I make in the house, I feel like the other people are paying attention to it and judging me even for creaks on the floor or flushing the toilet, and their judgement is hostile to me because then they have power and control over me and can use anything I do as fodder for emotional abuse and manipulation. I stay up late at night to avoid social interactions and even in the middle of the night when everyone is asleep I'm terrified that they're secretly awake and listening to me and judging me and growing hostile emotions towards me. nnI don't know if this actually is social anxiety, and if it's *not* I don't know what it *is*. It's a fear of judgement, embarrassment, of a supposed emotional threat, and of abandonment that drives me to feel this way. I don't know how social anxiety comes about in others, or how it presents or progresses in others. I'm just completely lost on what it is for me and what I'm supposed to do, other than seek professional help (which is still months away for me. And honestly I don't even know if I could actually take my mask off and open up to a therapist, they're still flawed opinionated threatening humans too). I guess I'm wondering if at this point I've become paranoid. It's just, I don't feel like I'm any ""one kind"" of documented paranoia, that I'm just intensely anxious of critisism and very sensitive to any form of rejection. Has social anxiety lead to misanthropy and paranoia for me? Is it just a trauma response? Maybe it's just my anxiety making me question this. I think I'm misunderstanding exactly what social anxiety, trauma responses, paranoia, and misanthropy are.nnI guess even though I feel as if people are constantly listening to me to judge me to form violent thoughts about me, I don't think most people will actually be violent towards me because logically I can work out that's sorta irrational. I know my family is just trying to help me, so when they criticize me it comes from a place of love and concern, even if I emotionally feel like they're rejecting me and being hostile. I do tho feel as if anyone in my life can turn on a dime and it's impossible to ever know who's my ally and who's my enemy, so everyone becomes my enemy. nnI'm 22 and have always struggled with social relationships, I've only ever had four friends. I come from a background of emotional abuse and mentally ill parents and was emotionally abused and betrayed by my ex too, one of my only four friends. All other friends I've tried to make have been emotional abusers too, even unintentionally. nnI'm just all alone, terrified and hateful of other people. I just want peace of mind.",0

When i moved schools in 5th grade i wasnt able to make a single friend or at least i thought i didnt have friends i just thought so poorly of myself and would roam the halls trying to hide my tears if the library was closed, everyday felt like torture, like everyone knew about me the girl who was always alone hanging in the library, the girl whos only friend was the librarian. Midway through the year we moved across the state into one of my aunts rooms to get away from my father, i think this triggered my depression because ever since i just havent been the same. Every day just feels a battle against myself constantly belittling myself for not being able to talk to someone or being too noticeable at the same time and constant thoughts of wanting to just die. Luckily i didn’t actually do anything rash because my mind was also flooded by thoughts about what people would think, what would people think if i killed my self or if they found out i ever harmed myself, my only way of coping was finding solace with people online and playing video games. Im 20 now and after all those years of small victories i thought maybe i was fine and normal and that everyone felt like this, but during the pandemic i somehow lost all of my coping strategies and can no longer feel normal. Ive asked my mom for help in the past when shit really got bad but told me to just keep trying we all feel like this sometimes that just reinforced my fears, that maybe i was making this all up and was convincing myself my problems werent worth helping. And recently things got really bad, and even though im 20 i still have to reach out and try to get her to help because i cant do it myself, no matter how many hours i spend looking for ways to get myself help i cant actually do it, theres something stopping me knowing ill have to face this. Its been more than three months that i told her i was unwell and it was hard to even join a zoom class or do homework because i was scared of what my class mates/ teachers would think of me and i still havent gotten the help i need just constant belittling saying im lazy or i dont want to be productive, saying she understands and she knows it’s serious and that i need to be responsible for getting help, even after telling her i physically feel like i cant, after she saw how bad i panic just calling someone to ask if they were open. Its just so soul crushing because i know i need help and ive asked for help but i cant actually get it, i just feel trapped. nnUm idk if anyone is going to read this because its just a vent but if u do i guess are you getting help and if so how did u actually get it.

6856,"koshka09","post","A suit caused 18 years (and going) of social anxiety/facial blushing","TLDR: Your negative interactions/behavior towards someone may cause them to develop crippling anxiety, ruining their lives. Even the slightest outburst of being an asshole can do damage.  Be kind to others.nn&amp;#x200B;nnAs I got off the phone with the court this morning, I am reminded of what started this all. nnEighteen years ago I was working my very first job as a little bagger at a grocery store when one day I was bagging the items of a guy in a suit, 40+ years in age. He had requested I put two one gallon milks in a single brown paper bag together, then put that paper bag into a plastic bag. I hesitated for a moment as I was thinking of how heavy that was going to be and how easily our bags ripped. If I could fit them both in one single paper bag without it ripping, the corners of the paper bag were definitely going to tear the plastic. I didn't say anything to him, but he immediately caught my hesitation. He proceeded to yell at me, a 16 year old girl, in front of all of my coworkers and customers (it was rush hour time). He called me stupid and said it didn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out. EVERYONE was staring at me, my face went bright red and I was extremely embarrassed. I angrily told him ""screw this, do it yourself"" then walked away and went to the break room. Surprisingly I didn't get in trouble for that.nnFrom then on out I started only blushing whenever a customer would talk to me, then I started to blush whenever a coworker did. I started blushing whenever I would get called on in class or when any attention was on me for that matter. Over the years it got worse and I developed a fear of blushing as well. When I would speak to a close friend or a family member I wouldn't blush immediately, but then the fear of blushing would kick in and I'd go bright red. This had a huge negative impact on my life. I developed social anxiety, I couldn't talk to anyone, I had a hard time going through job interviews. I ended up in call centers for the next 10 years as it was easier than dealing with the public and the staffing companies hired anyone so the interviews weren't as excruciating. nnI was working on my Bachelors in Homeland Security and Computer Science because I wanted to join the FBI, a life long dream, but knew I couldn't get through their interview process once I graduated. I saw a couple of doctors regarding this and both suggested I take Xanax. I didn't want to take it because I wouldn't be able to join the FBI, but since I wasn't going to graduate for 4 years, I figured if I could start managing it, eventually I can find a permanent solution that wasn't medication. I got on it and it only slightly helped, but not much and the following years proved to be not worth it. I was taking it on a daily basis at the same time every day, never abused it, drove hours later after taking it so I wasn't even slightly impaired. nn\*Side story: Long story short- At the time when I just got put on xanax, I sold my car to get my fiance's car out of repo since mine was a beater.. his was in repo because his ex took out a loan and used the car as collateral that was still both under their names as they hadn't settled their affairs apparently. After I took care of him while he was going through medical issues and he was back to a better health, he was cheating on me while I was at work. I found out and was trying to move out, but had no car to get to work, there were no bus routes and we lived too far away for me to walk\*nnAny way, I borrowed my step-dad's car for a couple of days while I figured out my situation. He failed to mention to me that the tie-rod on it was bad and not to drive at high speeds. One night I met up with a friend to discuss buying one of his motorcycles he was selling for cheap and offered to allow payment plans since I couldn't qualify anywhere due to my credit taking a dive trying to take care of my fiance. It would soon be spring so this would work for me until I could afford a car.nnOn the way there I got a flat tire down the road form the coffee shop, so I pulled into a lot next to a police department. I decided to just walk there to not keep my friend waiting. After our meeting, I went back to the car to change the tire, but one of the lug nuts was different and the tire iron wouldn't fit. An officer came out to help me, but once he realized his tire iron wouldn't work he called over a couple more officers to try to help. Finally, I called one of my coworkers who was down the road patrolling (security) and he came to the rescue. The freeway entrance was 30 seconds away. When I started driving onto the onramp, I heard a loud clank. I thought my tire had fallen off, but the tie rod ended up breaking. When I tried breaking to pull off on the side, the car spun out of control and hit the cement barrier 4 lanes over. Luckily it was late enough where there was only one person on the road and they avoided my car. They pulled over to the side, didn't approach me to see what was wrong, they just called the cops saying there was a drunk driver. I called the police because I didn't know the protocol, I just let them know I got into an accident, but was okay. They sent paramedics out to check me out as I hit my head a little and the police got my statement. I asked if I could just drive home, but one of the officers informed me my tire was folded under my car and they were going to call a tow truck for me. They had me call someone to come pick me up, so I did. When my ride got there, I started to put my belongings into his car (laptop, backpack, etc). When we were getting ready to leave, an officer that hadn't checked me out came out of nowhere and said he felt I was under the influence of something because I was ""slurring"" and pupils were dilated. Again, I had zero interaction with him and didn't even see him on scene. I'm assuming he heard from someone else or read the report that I take prescription medication (I was too honest at the time as I didn't like to lie). nnIt was February in Utah and I was in a skirt and high heels with no jacket. I tried telling him I was just cold and my face was frozen, but he made me take the field sobriety test. I passed everything but I was still slightly slurring, again due to a frozen face, but the walk the line was difficult because I kept putting my arms up to keep my balance. It was very ironic because I'm a very clumsy person and my family always joked that I'd fail a sobriety test if I ever had to take one. And I did. After that, they arrested me and took me to the station to do a blood test. I asked if I could take it again because it was warmer in the building, but they said no. They booked me and the mugshot website was right on it for posting my picture the next day. The owner of the company saw it because they usually look at it every day making fun of everyone in it and I was immediately fired. They didn't allow me to explain the situation, nor wait to see the outcome, all they said was ""classy"" sarcastically in a text.nnI had a terrible, lazy lawyer who immediately tried to ""relate"" to me by saying he understands me as he used to be a party person back in his day and used to do drugs all the time. I had never done drugs. I was stuck with him because I had already paid the retainer fee and couldn't afford another attorney. nnI compiled everything to help my case: a statement from the mechanic saying the tie rod broke and my car accident wouldn't have caused it to break, but it was instead the cause of my accident. I had the police officer statements who were helping me change my tire right before the accident, stating I didn't have the demeanor of an impaired person, I had a doctor statement saying the levels of xanax in my blood were consistent of me properly taking the prescribed dose every day in the morning, I had a statement from my eye doctor I've had for years stating my pupils have always been larger than normal because I have what is called the ""belladonna effect"". Even the police report diagram where it shows my accident. I would have literally had to stop my car on the free way, put it in reverse and do some kind of weird maneuver which still wouldn't have been possible because the wheels wouldn't have been able to turn unless the tie rod was broken. One of the charges for this was ""improper lane change"". Really? Yeah, sorry I didn't signal the lane change as my car was spinning out of control. nnMy attorney didn't use any of this and told me to plead guilty of a lesser charge. He said I would for sure lose my case and if they found me guilty, I would face a more serious charge. I found out later this to be completely false. I recently learned he is no longer practicing and all of his reviews over the years since were him screwing people over.nnI had a hard time finding a job because of my DUI, but finally found one a couple years later. I had been homeless for 3 years since my conviction and relied on showering at the gym. Finally I got back on my feet and started going to school again, this time at a community college for Criminal Justice and EMT because it was fairly cheap and I was paying out of pocket since I still owed on loans from the other school working on my bachelors and had to pay off $20k before going back to working on that degree. Towards the end when we had a final test to get certified as an EMT, the instructor went over the disqualifications, one which included misdemeanors. I didn't know that was a thing and wondered why they didn't go over that prior to enrolling. I asked him if my DUI was a disqualifier and he said yes. I ended up dropping that class before the final test which hurt me bad. School is a whole 'nother thing with father's death, etc, so won't get into that.nnAt my job, after 2 years of working in the call center, I moved into a non-call center role at the company managing a team of security analysts company wide for the next 5 years. I had to conduct meetings with other managers, investigations, deal with employee medical issues where I've had to apply medical training and have actually saved lives, etc at every US based office we had. It was literally a thankless job, but I still loved working there. I struggled with my blushing as bad as 16 years ago and needed to figure out something. I read about therapy where it gets to the root problem, but I knew what caused it and didn't think it would help. I read up on a couple of other things, surgery - which meant I could develop excess sweating problems instead of blushing, or beta-blockers. I gave beta-blockers a go and those have definitely made a drastic positive impact. I still blushed sometimes, but definitely not as much and it was getting better over time. nnFast forward to the pandemic. Masks are required and I felt this would be a good opportunity to wean myself off of the medication and force myself to deal with the blushing head on and get over it. After all, no one could see me blush. It started working, but then shortly after they closed our department and laid us off. So here I am today. It has been 4 months since I was laid off and my blushing is back in full swing as I don't interact with anyone ever now. Every job I apply for that pays decently in my field requires a background check/fingerprinting and I am getting denied STILL because of the DUI. Today I requested a hearing with a judge to hopefully have an early dismissal to have it expunged since in Utah the waiting period is 10 years and it has been 9. nnMy goals, dreams, life has been ruined all because of this asshole who wanted to belittle a 16 year old girl. The cut off for the FBI is 36 years of age, but you have to have a bachelors. I am 34, 35 this year and no way could get that in time. nnThanks guy.",1

I used to hide food, eat in the bathroom, avoid eating with people growing up. I managed to cope and everything was fine. Trust me I sat with people all throughout pre-college and nothing changed.nnThere's so much shame with it too. It just doesn't work, I tried so many times too, therapy several times, no again. It feels I'm going nowhere. I can't worry about eating if I'm about to fail out, etc.nnBut everytime I get food in college I'm about to cry. There is so much pain and anger/frustration just not being able to sit with a friend and eat. I was getting food today and was feeling all this shame and insecurity and the lady giving me food said ""i saw you earlier"" since I was probably getting food earlier, and that honestly was it, I sat at an empty table and was just shaking from anger, loneliness, shame. Why was I still eating alone? Fuck eating then, there was a few times where I had enough I just didn't even get food, if it was going to be so painful. When I have food, and I'm walking to my room, or eating alone, all those feelings come again, I see someone else and I look at the ground, I feel like such a disgrace, food everywhere and I never share it with anyone. There is so much hatred. The way it comes out in my voice, how people avoid me. I let out this rage within and people avoid me, they don't choose shifts with me, they put my name last (my therapist says that I could be picking out negative things, unless there is very clear evidence so) but I swear I see patterns. They do things different to differentiate from me, they can sense it, and that makes me so much more angry, I didn't do anything wrong and everyone is trying to isolate me. There is so much pain. How do you connect on this, normal people, with friends. 'I can't eat with people'. I'm shaking right now. I'm so insecure. Everyone hates me since I'm so so angry. Oh, it's not like I didn't have friends for a couple weeks, or I'm new in town, no I didn't have friends for like years. They can sense my hatred and anger. I can't describe how immensely hurt I am. Don't you understand I had to eat alone. Do you not see me for who I am. And the worst thing is I have to be normal, I can stop school and be normal, or continue it, walking around like I'm about to fall apart. I can heal, or continue to fucking work. I can take care of myself, or have to take care of others. And the saddest thing is I continue to work myself to a fucking dust since there wasn't an alternative. As lovable and kind and nice as I was society did not leave anything for me. Those nice greetings were playing with me. People don't want to be my partner since I can't execute at the level they are, I literally put everything into it and I can't be enough. The more I try the more the anger comes out, the hatred, the cruelty, and the more people push me to the bottom. If only you can understand-- why I am so angry. It was so painful, and I'm fighting for the future now, and have been for months on months. I'm there for you when there is nothing actually there. I keep fighting for something, anything so I can move forward. I keep doing, showing up, losing everything.",1

6943,"cyanide444","post","I am 25M and have treatment-resistant depression and social anxiety disorder; does this mean I will never have female friends or partners?","Hey all,nnSo from my previous post in askwomenadvice subreddit (from which I have been banned because apparently you can't contact the mods about why your posts are removed or they mute you, so if you keep reposting a thread with edits based on what you THINK is the problem, you get banned; you may look at my user profile if you would like a link to the thread), I found that based on a sample of 3 female individuals (poor sample size but the thread got closed), 33% have an aversion towards mentally ill individuals (especially men) that borders on contempt. Approximately 67% of respondents said they wouldn't date anyone with a mental illness, treated or not. So it seems that, based on the sample I obtained, women in this subreddit overwhelmingly hold depressed individuals in contempt or at the least they view them as ""damaged goods"" or ""burdens."" Clearly, no woman in my life, no matter how long I have known them can know about my mental illness. It is a defect. It makes me subhuman.nnHow does TRD manifest in me?: The depression part is contingent on whether I am in a relationship or not. When I am in a good relationship, I am not nearly as depressed. The fatigue, appetite loss, and bouts of sadness are minimal. I still occasionally get suicidal thoughts, but I reach out to whomever is willing to listen when I do (i.e. primarily my partner). I see purpose in the world, because my partner gives me purpose in the world. My drug use is dramatically reduced and porn consumption is essentially zero. However, when I am in isolation and not in a relationship (as I am now), I am chronically suicidal, have low mood, low self-esteem, high fatigue, and engage in self-destructive tendencies (reckless use of heroin, cutting, excessive drinking, etc). This can range in severity from moderate depression to severe, hospitalization-requiring depression. Sometimes ketamine and LSD can help pull me out of this hole, however (conventional antidepressants do not work). Do I hate myself? The answer is yes, but only without external input. The echo chamber of one's mind can amplify self-loathing, but if I have a partner or a good friend, I am less prone to spiraling. I know that some may call me out for wanting a codependency, but I must clarify that is not what I want. I have my own opinions. I am my own person. I don't bend to other peoples' will. However, I do have ""therapy dog syndrome."" This is a situation in which I become essentially a therapist for a few of the women to whom I am talking to (usually online). They usually unload their emotional burdens on me, I listen, give advice, and then they leave. I like being there for people, but sometimes I forget about the burden that is being placed on me and get lost, dragging my own mental health down too. I very rarely reach out to my friends for emotional support. I do not want to burden them. So I don't typically engage in such behavior in real life. Online is another story because I can be anonymous. I am going to emphasize this again: I DO NOT DUMP MY EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS ON OTHERS UNLESS IT IS A VERY SPECIFIC PROBLEM WITH A CLEAR SOLUTION. I don't know how many times I need to say this. It doesn't seem to get through to people on Reddit.nnHow does SAD manifest in me? It used to be quite bad, resulting in long bouts of isolation. These days, I am okay at talking to male friends and female coworkers (in a work context), but I am deathly terrified of talking to women in a social/nonprofessional setting. This has led to a pattern of avoidant behavior. If I do, by some unfortunate accident, do end up getting engaged socially by a woman, I sweat profusely, freeze up, and give a blank stare. At best I am extremely awkward and conversation does not flow smoothly.nnSo, in summary, in my current state I cannot talk to women. Moreover, I do not know if I am ""in a good place"" to start dating, but all of my psychiatrists and therapists have encouraged me to start (usually via apps like Bumble).nnSo given all of this information, I have a few choices: (1) I can commit suicide (2) I can give up pursuing women (as friends or partners) entirely (3) I can fake ""happiness"" using the wonders of psychopharmacologynnOption 1 is off the table for now because I just moved to Quebec. Option 2 will most likely lead to Option 1 unless I can get enough drugs to sustain me for a while. Option 3 is the most attractive solution. I have a two-and-a-half tier plan for option 3. It would start with me consuming large doses of LSD to induce psycholysis. Then from the disintegrated fragments of my consciousness, I would have to reassemble reality, giving me new perspective on life. Then, in phase 2, I would consume a combination of GHB (1-2 grams) and 3-methylmethcathinone (75 mg) or 4-fluoroamphetamine. I would need to consume these drugs daily and every time I interact with a woman. Finally, I would also occasionally need 100 mg ketamine (intramuscular) and 100-200 mg testosterone enanthate (intramuscular). I don't need advice on this cocktail. I have done enough research. Obviously, all of this would go along with continued therapy, even though I find therapy to be essentially worthless (and I only get 20 sessions a year under my student health insurance.... I need 40 sessions a year to be where I was last year).nnHere's where I need help: Where do I meet women in these COVID times? Dating apps have not been successful for me. How should I conduct myself around said women? Do you have any more tips for how I should hide my depression?nnHowever, drugs will only solve the confidence and anxiety issues. What else can I be doing to hide my depression from women I meet? Will I ever be ""dateable"" or should I just give up now?nnTL;DR I have untreatable depression that only seems to abate when I'm in a relationship (no, I do not seek codependency, that is an outright lie). Should I just never get in a relationship or should I work to better myself with pharmacology? In either case, what advice do you have for me?nnI already have been through over a decade of therapy, and it doesn't work.

6944,"Necessary_Number","post","A kid smiled at me today","Today I was out in public, just grocery shopping, hanging around in somewhat busy places and walking past cars. If you have social anxiety like me, these stuff probably is a struggle for you. But today was different for me. Why?nnPreparation. I watched a guy on youtube who said that people have a very close minded approach when it comes to medication for social anxiety. Pills change your brain chemistry, but so does exercise and the cold. So first thing I did in the morning was eating a breakfast, then doing a short workout (just 3 sets of biceps curls). After that I did Proggressive muscle relaxation which is a time tested method to reduce Anxiety. After my workout I took a cold shower which I feel is energyzing and relaxing at the same time. That morning routine takes quite a while (90min). But first of all, listen, I am not a little shy or reserved, no. At my best I can not be myself and at my worst, I am making a total fool of myself. So it is probably worth it. But this routine also consists of things I would have to do later the day anyway, like showering and eating. nnBreathing. I used to find that tip somewhat dumb and viewed it more as a meme than anything else, definetly not as something that can help significantly. But when I saw the look on my therapists face after telling her that I don't really do deep breathing, I realized that this is something I need to pick up. So yeah, I am pretty new to using Breathing as relaxation technique. But after 2 days of trying it out I think that every anxious situations should start with a big breath. I have this hypothesis that Breathing works even better when you practise Progressive muscle relaxation, because Breathing makes your muscles more likely to unflex. nnStopping antagonistic energy. When I am anxious, I have a lot of antagonistic energy towards people on the street. I can't really control it directly, because this is the fight or flight response for anxiety. But what I can do is to try to think positive about people I see on the street and just give them as less antagonistic energy as possible. What happened today was really cool. A kid looked at me and was not disturbed/ anxious/ whatnot but kind of smiled at me. This never happens to me although I am outside a lot. nnWalking slowly and listening to relaxing music. I think that in all of my most recent good experiences I just purposely took things slow. Slow walk, slow melodic music will maybe lead to slower thinking. And that is I think kind of a good thing. Just take a slow breathe and just slow down, my friend. I guess it is common sense that this is a good idea?nnI want to recommend you guys a youtube chanel I found: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBS3TSMoT-9VpQ0Jabu1ayA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBS3TSMoT-9VpQ0Jabu1ayA). It is a guy who used to have social anxiety himself and he was able to overcome it and become extremely confident. I am not absolutely sure, but I think he also studied clinical psychology. Many of his videos are clickbait where I just think oh god, what bs is coming now. But when I watch it, it makes a whole lot of sense. For example in a video on how to beat social anxiety he says that what beats social anxiety is ultimately your wish to overcome it, that will ultimately lead to you initiating change. I really like this approach, just taking a step back.nnThe support means much to me, you guys acknowledging my posts and giving tips is really something that I find motivating. Btw I am a 20 year old male and my main focus in life is to beat social anxiety. If you have any thoughts, question, tips, feel free to comment, I appreciate and now I will just play a videogame and be happy about my good day.",1

Also, this is my first Reddit post so I apologize if this is a bit jumbled up and unorganized. nnI’m 20F, always been a shy person, and was officially diagnosed with social anxiety at 16 and also ADHD at 19. My social skills haven’t always been the best, and actually had improved quite a bit before the pandemic. Needless to say my social anxiety has since gotten worse. I try to avoid leaving my house unless it’s absolutely necessary and I’m really uncomfortable around people I don’t know. I can be a totally different person once I get to know someone and they get to know me, but even then I’m still pretty awkward and don’t pick up social cues easily and often misinterpret them. nnWhen it comes to dating, I’m a mess. It’s like my anxieties and awkwardness is amplified a hundred times and getting to know guys I’m interested in is even harder. I’ve always had an easier time making friends with girls but due to some traumatic experiences (I was bullied by a group of boys in elementary school, got blamed for it by literally everyone and my mom told me she didn’t want me having so much as a crush on a boy as if that’s something I can control and made me feel like I was promiscuous until I started college even though she knew I never left the house and I was a virgin until I was 19) in childhood my social skills fly out the window when guys enter the picture. Literally every time I’ve had a crush on a guy I end up getting rejected and every time the feeling was mutual it never worked out. I’ve only ever had 2 boyfriends and I met them through mutual friends (who basically set us up). I get really awkward when alone with guys, whether we’re in a public place or alone together. I get really weird about PDA and I’m always tense and nervous when things get more heated. nnWith things somewhat returning to normal, I’m getting interested in dating again. I have a crush on my coworker (28M) who I’ve worked with for almost 2 years but I’m not sure how to flirt or get to know him better. Some of my friends think I could do better than him and suggested that I’m just lonely. They’re not wrong about the loneliness.  I used to get a lot of social interaction before the pandemic and now work is the only place where I meet and interact with other people in general. My friends have suggested dating apps, and I’ve been using Tinder and Bumble but it’s difficult finding guys I like on there and when I do I don’t get many matches. When I do match with a guy I feel anxious because I never know what to say and nothing ever goes anywhere. I prefer meeting guys through work or school because it’s easier for me to get to know someone I see on a consistent basis. I’m really interested in my coworker but I’m still torn between whether I should pursue him or not (just fyi...it’s a retail job and we basically have the same title. The only difference is he works full time and has worked there longer and I’m a part timer). The last time I had a serious crush on a guy he wasn’t interested because I “had too much baggage” and he had his own to deal with (he was dating/hooking up with other girls at the same time so I think he just wasn’t interested in me). I was devastated and it still makes me feel like no one’s going to like me romantically because of my mental illness. This especially why I probably won’t pursue my current crush, because I’ve had panic attacks at work before and everyone in our department knows I have anxiety &amp; ADHD. I’ve talked to my crush before and we’ve been making more small talk recently but I’m afraid of coming off as creepy due to my poor social skills if I try to flirt or talk to him more often. I don’t know how to flirt with guys without making it too obvious and my friends keep telling me to flirt but never give me tips on how to flirt. nnAnother problem I have with dating is that I’m often overshadowed by my best friend (19F) who’s my polar opposite. She’s an extrovert, a social butterfly, is way prettier, approachable and likeable than I am and always has a lot of suitors. I’m lowkey jealous bc I rarely get any attention from guys and I feel like I’m never going to have a boyfriend. I wish I didn’t have have mental health issues because I think I would be more likable without them. I’ve been in and out of therapy for 9 years and I’m currently seeing a therapist but none of their advice about socializing with guys seems to help. nnIf you’ve made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read about my social anxiety, insecurities and my pathetic dating life. nnTldr - I am the most awkward person I know and have a crush on a coworker who I’ll probably never pursue because I have no idea how to flirt without unintentionally being creepy and I’m really insecure",1

7132,"Necessary_Number","post","My theory on why I am progressing a lot","Although I am euphoric, because I just had a win, I will take my time to state every single important fact. I know from my mom that I was a shy kid. It has always been there. I was bullied when I was 12. Then I got into a new class and did anything to have friends. Having friends and people liking me was so important to me. I believe that this is the route cause of social anxiety. You need other people to think that you are cool. The moment you need to be liked by other people on the street is the moment you start to act. Why do you need other people to like you? So they don't bully you. So they don't do harm to you. Other people are capable of harming you in some way or another. There are two ways of stopping people to harm you. The first one is that you make them like you. The other one is to fight back and make it a principle to not let someone harm you or your close ones. That is the right way. See the rational reality. The people on your streets are not your friends and they are not harmless either. My therapist likes to say that other people can't harm me, so there is no reason to be scared. But is this rational? No. nnLet go of needing other people to like you. Start having aggressive energy. When I am scared of someone here is what I do. I imagine him molesting my sister or taking nude pictures of my mom and publishing them or sometimes someone just talking shit. What happens is that I get ready to fight. The thought of some stranger doing something terrible to me makes me start acting like a man. I start getting fantasies about seriously hurting people. The other night I dreamed about ripping my bullies dick off and pulling his eyes out. You might think that I act aggressively towards people, but I don't. I am respectful and friendly. But what everybody can tell is that I do that, because I choose to.nnI pay close attention to my posture. Your shoulders need to be back all the time. It is impossible to have aggressive energy and bad posture at the same time. I practise progressive muscle relaxation and often use music as a way to distract myself from bad anxiety thoughts.nnI pull my shoulders back and think about people harming my mother or sister which makes the need to be liked by those same people go away. Why not use the things most important to you to motivate you to become a protector? The energy I have instead is ""If you do anything to me that I don't like I will harm you and I would be ready to seriously hurt you"". Of course it will never go that far but thinking about assaulting people will get you ready to actually scream at them. Get your mind right, people are not your friends. They are potential enemys. Be ready to fight and communicate it by your upright stance and your strong eyes.nnI bought a posture trainer online to train posture. Posture is important, because with posture you commit to the big dick energy. You also start with it. I start with posture, then fuck you thoughts and then commit with my posture and then I am ready to have extraordinarily confidence, honestly. I am rating many interactions I have had in recent times with a 9 out of 10.",1

7166,"breezie9200","post","I am about to be fired for bringing my mental illness to work (TW: mentions of suicidal thoughts)","TW: mentions of suicidal thoughts (tagging as NSFW just in case) nnHi. I (20F) have social anxiety disorder, ADHD, and depression and I am probably gonna be fired from my job over it. I’ve been diagnosed as socially anxious and depressed since I was 16 and recently diagnosed with ADHD since I was 19 and have been in and out of therapist’s/psychiatrist’s offices since I was 11. I currently go to therapy and see a psychiatrist and I’m on Adderall XR, hydroxyzine and birth control. nnFor the past few weeks I have been going through stress that has been almost unbearable to the point that I have been having intense intrusive suicidal thoughts and I’m afraid of being fired for it. The reason why I think I might be fired is because I have poor social skills and don’t know proper social etiquette regarding appropriate topics of discussion at work. I have always been socially awkward and shy as well. When ever I try to vent to anyone it comes off as them telling me that it’s my fault that no one talks to me because apparently I do not try to socialize with anyone at all. I work in food service and I don’t understand why I have to initiate a conversation everytime someone asks me to do something. I have been trying to take their observations to heart and try to be more responsive and more sociable and to smile more often but apparently that is not enough. It’s almost as if they are expecting me to make a total turnaround overnight when anyone with a brain can figure out that mental illness doesn’t work that way. I always feel like my feelings and perspective are never validated and that I am wasting everyone’s time. nnRecently I have been having several mental breakdowns/crying fits and these often carry over into work. I know that it is unprofessional but everyone has bad days. However whenever I do it it suddenly becomes a taboo. I texted something to a friend about wanting to die (and no; I have no plans to act out on any intrusive SI thoughts that surface) and she and another coworker friend contacted an online suicide hotline and they told them to tell my dad, and then they found him on Facebook and messaged him. This crushed me bc I feel like I cannot be trusted and no one believes me when I say that I will be okay and won’t hurt myself. I do not want to have these thoughts and even my therapist thinks I do not belong in a mental hospital. nnEveryone at work has been concerned about me and my issues since the 4th of July because I posted on Snapchat that I was crying in the bathroom (during my break, off the clock, and with no one else around) bc I felt lonely and how I felt like no one wants to talk to me bc I have social anxiety and have panic attacks and everyone walks on eggshells bc of it. I know I should not have posted that but the damage has been done. My coworkers are treating me as if I am 8 years old and will not talk with me about my issues, instead asking my best friend about them as if she knows me and my mental health better than I do out of fear of upsetting me more. In reality them infantilizing me is doing more damage. I am not choosing to be anxious and I cannot just leave my mental health at home bc the brain doesn’t work that way. nnWell, I am on vacation and I was upset about something and I tried to vent to my best friend (R) and she basically told me to shut up and be happy for once. She is the only person other than my therapist I feel comfortable with venting to about these kinds of things and this reaction took me by surprise. I told her that I know what she did (messaging my dad) and then found out that it was her and my other coworker (A) and that they called the aforementioned online hotline. I feel betrayed by this. And then I find out that the store manager is going to talk to me about my issues finally when I get back from vacation basically to tell me that I can quit if I don’t want to work there anymore and that I have to make a change if I want to continue working there. I am deathly afraid of conflicts and confrontation of any kind and I cannot stop thinking about how I am going to be fired for having mental health problems. This job has been the only regular social interaction since the pandemic started and my social skills are a little rusty. I am not in the right mental frame of mind to have to start allover with making friends from scratch with barely any social skills. I understand that my behavior is unprofessional and it makes other people uncomfortable and unable to do their jobs when I have my episodes. But at the same time they all get to clock out and go home and not have to deal with me and my issues. I have to deal with my anxiety 24 hours a day 7 days a week. I don’t get to take a break from myself. I can’t even go on vacation without ruminating about how crazy I am or having a mental breakdown. These episodes have been going on for a little over a month and a half but have intensified since a month ago when my mom went to the hospital and I started my new medication (the hydroxyzine) at the same time. I don’t know if it’s me being stressed out and unable to relax or if it’s something medication related. All I know is that as long as I am anxious and depressed I will inherently be unprofessional and crazy and the person no one wants to be around. Nobody seems to understand that I am doing the best that I can but it never seems to be enough. I feel really discouraged and I do not know what to do to fix the problem as I am already doing what I am supposed to do (ie by seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist and being compliant with medication and treatment). nnTLDR; I have mental health issues that are now getting in the way of me doing the job and it makes me depressed, socially isolated and rejected, and makes others uncomfortable and will probably get me fired from my job. I am feeling very discouraged",1

7228,"Zredbird13","post","How getting diagnosed with ADHD helped my social anxiety","Hey! I'm hoping that in writing this post it will help anyone who realises they can relate to my experience. I'm not saying that all social anxiety is caused by ADHD, but mine certainly was and I discovered that I have social anxiety wayyyy before I realised I had ADHD. I'm sorry this will probably be long and detailed but I really want to make sure that anyone else like me can have a realisation and that this may help.nnWhen I was a child I was so confident and outgoing, I made friends with everyone and was a social butterfly. It was around the time I hit puberty and moved into secondary school that I became painfully shy. I could not talk to adults AT ALL, I wouldn't speak to anyone I wasn't already friends with and I would get awful physical manifestations of anxiety when at school. Being on my own out in public at all was terrifying for me and I wouldn't be able to catch my breath, I would go bright red and sweat a lot. I developed gastritis several times from social anxiety triggered acid reflux/indigestion from being at school. My doctors would be asking me what foods triggered the indigestion and I would always reply none, it would just only ever happen at school. I would joke that I was allergic to school it was that bad. My parents were so confused as to how I went from being outgoing and confident to so shy and timid. They forced me to get a job as a waitress which was horrendeous for a while, but as I got used to it I got slightly better. I would always be told by customers and co-workers how proud they were of my improvement, but I was still very socially anxious. I couldn't really create conversations with people, I stumbled over my words and avoided speaking to customers as much as possible. I just couldn't seem to grasp speaking to people like everyone else could.nnI realised I had social anxiety when I was 18 and tried as hard as I could to ""fix it"". I was too anxious to go to a doctor about it on my own, but all my attempts failed. Every time I had to go somewhere on my own I got the physical effects again, I couldn't breathe properly, I would be drenched in sweat, I wouldn't know where to look and I would just be completely on edge and feel so embarrassed. It got to be a real problem and I constantly felt embarrassed by myself and like a child for not being able to be independent. At university I would rely on friends as a crutch and only go to the shops with a friend, otherwise I would honestly feel traumatised by the time I got back home if I went on my own. I'd get back and have to take all my clothes off as I would be so hot and sweaty and would have to sit and catch my breath for a while. My social anxiety never got much better, no matter how much I tried to change my thoughts and expose myself to situations I was anxious about. I was awful at speaking to people I didn't know still and older adults were out of the question. nnI turned 21 and discovered that I could potentially have ADHD. Aside from my social anxiety problems, I had real bad issues with procrastination, holding my attention to things I needed to and I was just chronically disorganised and messy. It was a real lightbulb moment and I spent months researching before finally plucking up the courage to talk to a doctor about it. This was during the midst of the COVID lockdowns so everything was remote and over the phone which is the only reason why I ended up being able to speak to a doctor. My social anxiety would definitely have prevented me from going if appointments were still in person. I also signed up for a talking therapy for my social anxiety, as this had been offered remotely too because of covid. I got put onto an online cbt program for social anxiety but it just didn't work for me at all. The solutions they gave me just didn't work and I didn't see any improvement, really everything they said were things I'd already tried before. I ended up getting diagnosed for ADHD a month later and then put on medication. Since they are stimulants, it is warned that anxiety can end up being worse, but the exact opposite happened for me. nnI've been on my medication for about 4 months now and the difference is astonishing. I can so easily go out on my own now I just feel so calm and just chilled out. It's like night and day and I couldn't quite believe it. Going to the shops on my own feels like nothing, I can breathe properly, I don't overheat and sweat and I can even talk to shop assistance if I need help!  I took a trip to London and had to manage the train and subway on my own during a really busy time, and again I felt so ridiculously calm and chilled out!!!  I can have conversations with anyone and I'm not freaking out about what to say next. My relationship with my older family members has strengthened enormously because I actually enjoy sitting and talking to them now. I've discovered that my social anxiety was completely caused by ADHD, so treating my ADHD has fixed it. nnThe way ADHD caused my social anxiety was this. Because I was so outgoing and confident as a kid with ADHD, I could often get over excited and be a bit too much for people. This caused me to become embarrassed and retreat a bit as a got older. I also struggled to talk to people if we didn't have interests in common. With adhd, we have very black and white thinking and are either interested in something completely or it bores the shit out of us to the point where we will drift off and become distracted. Because of this I just did not know how to talk to people especially older adults since I didn't know what the hell to talk about and I couldn't pay attention to conversations and would forget things that people have told me which is obviously going to be stressful in social situations. Going out on my own was an issue because I was not confident in myself. ADHD makes you impulsive and so distractable to the point where you end up doing a lot of things wrong because you didn't think first or didn't pay attention to what to do. So I became overly insecure in all my decisions and scared that I would end up doing the wrong thing or do something badly. I was fine going out with a friend because then I had that reassurance from someone else, but on my own I was just not confident in my ability to do things correctly. This is why I got the physical effects of anxiety too, as I would be constantly on edge and scared of messing up somehow it triggered my fight or flight. My ADHD also means that I'm constantly thinking and my mind goes a mile a minute, thinking of every single possibility so this definitely also contributed towards my social anxiety.nnI thought I was just an introvert, but since being medicated I've discovered how much I enjoy socialising and that I'm actually an extrovert at heart. I would never have thought in a million thought that the solution to my social anxiety would be so simple and easy. I feel like being diagnosed with ADHD has saved my life, as I was so worried about being a proper adult and having to live so socially anxious when I couldn't even leave the house on my own without panicking. If you at all relate to my experience or are confused about where your social anxiety has arisen from, with normal cbt and exposure methods not working out for you, it could be likely that you too are neurodivergent or have a deeper issue that had caused the social anxiety.",0

7262,"OW2000","post","What Social Anxiety is Like","  Hi everyone! So before I get into this I just want to explain a little as to why I’m sharing my story with you all. For some background, I am a 20-year-old sophomore in college. I have struggled with social anxiety for most of my life, I was formally diagnosed in 10th grade. As someone who has dealt with things like this, I hope nobody else ever has to go through it. I have made improvements in my life as of late, so I really wanted to share my story with you all in hopes of reaching out to people who are struggling. One thing that has always helped me both in recovering and when I was in the midst of all this, is knowing that I’m not alone in going through these things, so hopefully this can provide the same for you. And I do want to warn you beforehand that I do talk about some very dark and distressing real things that I and I’m sure others with social anxiety have felt before. My hope is that the people who read this who have social anxiety come away from it knowing that there’s others out there who feel all of these horrible things, and I hope it can provide comfort for you that you are not alone. And also for anyone who doesn’t have social anxiety, I hope you can come away from this better understanding what it is like for people who have it. The more educated we are when it comes to mental health, the better a job we can do in helping those that are hurting. And I really hope that this can spark something to help people.nnI guess I’ll start from the very beginning and go from there. I was born in the year 2000 in a town just north of Atlanta, Georgia. Over the first few years I moved around several states here the southeast including Alabama, South Carolina, and Florida (where I’ve lived for about 17 years). Growing up I was always a really shy and quiet kid, and for the longest time I thought that was all it was, nothing out of the ordinary stood out. nnElementary school went by. I was never very outgoing but I did speak to other kids in my classes and had casual friends here and there. I suppose there were times where I felt like I was a little behind everyone else in terms of socializing, but being a ten-year-old I didn’t think much of it. People would comment on how quiet I was frequently so I just figured I was more introverted, not anything wrong. After second grade I had moved to a different county, and thus lived in a different school district. I’m not entirely sure how it worked but my parents were able to keep me at my elementary school that I’d attended up to that point, so I finished all the way through fifth grade there.nnFor middle school I wasn’t accepted into the school all the people I knew were going to. I made the switch to the one right down the street from my house at that point, in a new school district. It was definitely a little weird having to essentially start all over again with people I’d never seen before in my life, but that’s just how it goes sometimes. I remember my sixth grade year was essentially a year of trying to fit in with people and also take care of business with my classwork as usual. I didn’t really have any trouble with my classes or grades at all that year, but from my recollection this was the year where I started to have a harder time with other aspects of life. I found myself trying to fit in in crowds that I probably shouldn’t have at times, and overall I felt like I wasn’t a kind of person that I’d like if I met myself. I got myself caught up/involved in a lot of drama at times, on both sides of it. I developed bad habits that I really was not proud of at all. And overall I just really hated where I was going in terms of the social aspects of my life. Up to this point in my school career I’d also experienced bullying here and there in elementary and middle school, both physically and other forms as well. And I feel like those instances are where I started to change who I was, in order to fit in and be respected. And really I was just doing the opposite. nnSeventh grade is where a lot of really odd things started to change and go in the wrong direction with my mental health and social skills. I really had backed myself into a corner socially. I basically sat at the back of the class and rarely spoke to anybody, unless they approached me first. Around this time is when I started to realize maybe there was more going on than just being a shy kid. I wasn’t just naturally quiet like that, I was the way that I was because of things I was feeling, but I couldn’t figure out exactly what that was, if that makes sense. At the time all I really knew was that I just felt bad, and I started to feel like I was different than a lot of the people around me. Everything went smoothly academically speaking that year, but I pretty much interacted with nobody while at school. nnFast forward to eighth grade. This year I became more and more isolated socially and started to feel like an outcast. I was taking algebra 1 honors that year as well and had a really difficult time with it. Around 7th and 8th grade I started having a difficult time even talking to my teachers. And throughout k-12 school that was a problem. From my recollection I think that was the first apparent sign of social anxiety; I wasn’t not talking to classmates/teachers out of being shy, it was out of fear essentially. An irrational fear of being judged or being perceived as stupid, etc.. But at the time I didn’t know what was wrong, all I knew was that there was something that wasn’t quite right with me. And that I felt horrible for reasons I couldn’t understand. Freshman year of high school was more of the same. nnNow when sophomore year of high school came around, I had started to question if I could have depression or something along that line. I had virtually no social skills at all from isolating myself so much, and barely talking to anyone outside of my own home for years. I had no idea how to interact with my classmates, make friends, approach my teachers for anything, or even just start a conversation with anyone. I felt like a completely worthless person basically. I was really stressed with school as well and all of the other things added on top of that was miserable. I honestly felt like I had nothing in my life to live for. Something I struggle with to this day even is opening up to people about most things, especially emotions/how I feel. So for awhile I contemplated whether I should tell my parents or not, and I eventually just decided that if I didn’t do something then I probably wouldn’t make it out of high school. So I asked if I could see a therapist. And I’ve been in therapy since. And it was then that after discussing all the things I was feeling that I got diagnosed with social anxiety. nnJunior and senior year were still the same socially for the most part. I was able to keep how I was feeling in check, at least better than before. But in terms of social skills, I was still lost. nnI graduated in June 2019, and started college in the Fall. Things weren’t perfect but better for sure. I still kept to myself a lot aside from hanging out with my roommate, but I at least didn’t feel miserable all the time. I don’t know exactly how to explain it, I didn’t feel happy or sad, it’s like I was just kind of there if that makes sense. Like I’d outcasted myself from society almost and lived in my own little bubble most of the time. Normal human interaction didn’t come naturally to me at all. I’d see how others around me interacted with each other and in my head I’d think: “How do you do that?” I saw everyone around me having fun, making friends, and just essentially doing all the things that I didn’t have any clue how to do. And it’s not that I didn’t want to fix my social life, it just didn’t register with me how to. nnThe thing that really helped me keep my head up the last year or two of high school and the start of college was my passion for what I wanted to do after school. Growing up I had always wanted to be a zoologist/zookeeper, and help animals in any way that I could with my career. So I would just keep myself focused on that and try to ignore all the other things I had going on. I mean that I’d pretty much ignore things I was feeling in order to keep all the things that bothered me at bay, and that was honestly a terrible way to deal with it. It was like putting band aid after band aid on my problems only to serve as a surface level fix to a much deeper issue. I became more and more disconnected from my feelings because of this. It was essentially a bomb with a timer on it at that point. nnAnd that last sentence proved to be true this past spring in my second year of college. By that point I had started to get things going on the right track in certain aspects, I’d made two of the most amazing friends a guy could ever ask for within the past year, and things were going semi-okay with school. I had withdrawn from my chemistry class a couple of times, but I went into the spring semester feeling a lot better about where I stood with it. I felt confident enough that I could use all the resources I had available to get the job done. But same as I mentioned above, I was so far out of touch with what was going on mentally/emotionally with me. I thought things were getting better when really I was hiding a lot of demons. I was somewhat getting better with my interactions with my friends, but otherwise I was still inept with everyone else. nnAnd as it turned out I screwed up in my chemistry class again. As a result, my hopes for my dream career that had essentially been my crutch through life for a while, were dead. Like I said above how my social anxiety and personal demons were like a bomb waiting to go off, all hell broke loose. Everything that I tried my best to ignore and hold back was right there in my face again. And all of it was my own fault. nnSo I just explained how my situation manifested over time, and now I’d like to explain more about what social anxiety/depression are like. As I said, my biggest mistake was that I bottled up everything for a long time until it became too much to handle. And if you’re reading this as someone who doesn’t have social anxiety or hasn’t experienced things like this, you’re probably wondering why didn’t I do something? Why didn’t I just talk to someone? What do you mean that you don’t know how to interact with others? And I’m sure a lot more questions as well. If you are somebody who deals with things like this you’ll probably be able to relate to a lot of these. nnIt’s being so isolated from everything that conversations and interactions with others don’t come naturally to you. You see how most everyone else is with each other and it’s like a completely foreign concept to you. And you know that you could try to strike up a conversation with people, but you have no idea how to. Because as I said, things that come naturally to others don’t even register with you. And you’re scared to death that if you do try the other person will see how weird and awkward you are and be put off by it. So you say to yourself “what’s the point?”nnWhen you do interact with people, it’s like there’s this demon making you overthink and doubt every single thing you do. I’ve heard it described by others as being in an abusive relationship with yourself, and I feel like that’s pretty accurate. nn“I want to text them something, but what if they’re busy right now and I’m annoying them?” “Am I being too clingy for them?” \*proceeds to hold off on it indefinitely nn“What if they find me boring?” nn“What if people are just being nice to me because they see how far behind I am from everyone else and they feel bad?” nn“There’s no way they’d want to do that with me, I’m too boring.”nn“What if people think my interests and opinions are stupid, etc?”nn“How the heck do I be fun and spontaneous like everyone else?”nn“Do people see me as an equal?”nnYou constantly replay every little thing and find some way to criticize yourself over it. You find yourself reading into social cues that probably aren’t even there. You find yourself holding back things you want to say to people around you for fear of sounding weird/awkward. nnAnd all of this just eats away at you over time and the idea of having a normal life seems crazy to you. It makes it ridiculously hard to open up to people and form closer relationships with those around you, much less even make friends in the first place. nnThe idea of ever having a romantic relationship in your life? With everything that your brain makes you perceive as wrong with yourself? Good luck. nnSometimes you’ll even be physically ill from it. nnYou’re reluctant to ask for help because for whatever reason you’re afraid of what the other person will think. Applies to school, work, any situation. “What if I’m missing something obvious and they think I’m an idiot? Better to figure this out ourself.”nnYou’re mind goes completely blank in conversations and you don’t know what to say. nnYou see how different you are from seemingly everyone around you and you feel like you’re less than everyone else. You feel like you have no personality. You feel worthless. You feel like your friends and family would be happier if you, this helpless, socially inept burden as you perceive yourself, weren’t a part of their lives. nnCan’t hold a conversation. Can’t make eye contact very much. Can’t say anything without overanalyzing the crap out of it first. Someone texts you? You spend the next hour making sure what you wrote back doesn’t sound stupid. Because you legitimately don’t know how conversation works. To you, it’s not something that spontaneously happens.nnYou end up believing all these horrible things about yourself, and you have no idea how to fix it. It makes it so that you can rarely ever do anything in a relaxed manner, because the anxiety over every aspect of it is there every time. nnYou know in your heart that none of these fears or things you believe about yourself are true, but then the “what if’s?” pull you right back in.nnYou know that you have a lot of interests, cool hobbies, opinions, passions, random thoughts about things, creative and fun ideas, dreams and goals for your future…… and none of it is ever expressed. You have the hardest time connecting with others. You see and hear others talk about and do all of these things that seem impossible for you. You go through this part of your life missing out on so much, and the most painful thing is knowing that it’s all your fault.",1

7325,"Peachntangy","post","Change is possible. It can get better, I promise.","I’m 23 years old, and since literally the beginning of my life I’ve suffered from severe social anxiety. I didn’t begin to talk at all until I was 3 years old, not because I didn’t understand or because I wasn’t able to speak, but because I was terrified of talking in front of other people. Talking to strangers was so incredibly painful to me. I was so afraid of saying the wrong thing or being scrutinized. It was inexplicable. I did suffer some bullying in early elementary school, but my social anxiety preceded it. There was no reason for me to be so anxious, but I was. I believe my social anxiety is an inherited mental illness. Both of my siblings have also been diagnosed with social anxiety. nnPerhaps surprisingly, I consider myself an extrovert. I for a long time thought I was an introvert, as my social anxiety made me painfully shy. I’ve learned since then that although extroversion and introversion may be correlated with shyness, my social anxiety extends beyond mere shyness. It is a disorder. For a long time it consumed my mind. And it destroyed me because while I suffered when with other people, I also suffered when alone. While making friends was excruciating, the few I managed to make I loved dearly. I loved being around people, and I longed to be with them. I didn’t understand why it was so difficult for me, and so easy for other people.nnMy life really started to change when I was around 15. I started learning Spanish a few years prior and loved it a lot, as well as was pretty good at it. I decided I wanted to do a foreign exchange program and live in another country for a year. I talked with a counselor at school about it and she introduced me to a program and helped me apply for it. The interviews and functions I had to attend for it were terrible, but I got though. At first I felt excitement. However, as the day I was to leave for Spain grew closer, I began to feel full of dread. I nearly had a panic attack on the plane there. Meeting my host family was terrifying. Speaking a foreign language was agonizing. The first two months I was there I could barely eat. Anytime I did, I would vomit. I gained a lot of weight (counterintuitively, but I suspect my body entered some kind of survival mode). The point is, while my fellow exchange students were having the times of their lives, I was miserable and depressed. At this time I didn’t know I had social anxiety disorder. I thought my “shyness” was a character flaw that I had to surmount. Somehow, somehow, I made it to the end of my year-long exchange. I attribute this to my wonderful host family, who supported me in every way, knowing I was struggling so hard. Without them, I certainly would have packed my things and went home very quickly.nnYears of high school and college have passed since then, and while they were happening I didn’t notice any change, but looking back, I have made MASSIVE progress. After coming home from my exchange, I actually was able to raise my hand and ask questions in class without feeling intense dread and shame. I never could do that before. I even made a few more friends than I had before. nnBy the time college came, I was looking forward to meeting new people more than I was dreading it. First conversations were difficult and painful, but they wouldn’t send me into those awful spirals where you question everything you said and did for days after, as I used to experience. I got my first customer-service oriented job. I had to learn to answer the phone, which was horrible at first. I was mortified any time I heard a phone ring, because it reminded me of my job. I stuttered and stumbled my way through my first several dozen calls. But slowly, slowly it grew easier. I also joined a club at school (for like the first time ever!!) and got super involved in it. I was TERRIFIED because I didn’t know anyone at first, but I ended up having a great experience and making some new friends. nnI got my first job at a public library, where I’ve always wanted to work, last year. Although I loved aspects of the job, I dreaded going to work in the morning because I didn’t know who I was going to have to talk to at work. And that dreaded phone!! Patrons come into public libraries with the most specific and unusual of questions, and that uncertainty really triggered my social anxiety. nnFast forward to now. I’m working at another public library. Getting through the day having to interact with so many patrons can be exhausting. I still stumble and stutter on the phone. I still say and do awkward things because of my anxiety. But it’s different. Conversations and other interactions can be tiring, awkward, and difficult, but they’re different. I feel like I know how neurotypical people feel when they talk about social situations being hard. They can be hard, but they don’t decimate my self confidence or self esteem anymore. I don’t walk away from a botched interaction hating myself anymore. And I botch fewer interactions now. I look forward to parties and meeting new people even though I know it won’t be easy. I actually LIKE my job where I talk to dozens of strangers every day. I can make mistakes and not feel intensely embarrassed about it anymore. I’m a college student still, and I find myself raising my hand in class and feeling eager to answer or give my thoughts. And when they don’t come out perfectly, I don’t scrutinize and think about it for days after. Sometimes I am hindered, but I am not paralyzed by my social anxiety anymore. At least, there are far fewer moments when I feel like that. nnFor the first time in my life, I’ve realized I feel free. I didn’t even notice how much easier my life had gotten, despite it being full of many more actual challenges, since I was a child and a teenager. Ordering at a restaurant? I don’t even mind it anymore. I don’t even have to REHEARSE anymore before talking. I can just talk, and even when the words come out awkwardly, I can shrug it off (That is, at least most of the time). I can’t believe that this is how most people in the world experienced life since birth. I sometimes get really sad because I think about how many missed opportunities I’ve had in my life because of social anxiety. I’ve missed out on a lot. Which sucks. But I try to remind myself that the progress I’ve made is admirable, and that while I still have some ways to go, I have so much more time to take advantage of life now.nnI’ve struggled with several mental illnesses throughout my life—besides SAD, also BPD and MDD. But social anxiety has exacerbated these, and my progress with it has helped to mitigate my symptoms from these other disorders. Social anxiety has certainly sent me to dark places, including suicidal ideation and attempts. nnSo how did I get this far? Therapy has certainly helped. My family, while supportive, is also pretty distant (since we’re all socially anxious lol), so they’re more of a neutral factor rather than a contributor to my success. Honestly, what I think helped the most is the exposure I forced myself to go through. I think I had the motivation to force myself to suffer basically because I had such a drive to be with people since I’m a big extrovert. While I wouldn’t recommend doing what I did, basically throwing myself to the wolves without any sort of therapist guidance for years, what I want you to know is that while putting yourself out of your comfort zone can feel like the worst thing in the world at the time, IT GETS BETTER. Every time you do it, it gets a tiny fraction easier. It takes a LONG time, (and my journey is still not over,) but you will look back one day and see the change. And it’s so worth it. (I totally recommend working on your social anxiety with a therapist if that’s accessible to you. A therapist will help make sure you don’t overextend yourself, among other important things.)nnI guess the TLDR here is that 1) I literally have been so socially anxious since birth I couldn’t speak until I was three 2) I started exposing myself to situations that triggered TF out of my social anxiety as a teenager which 3) helped me make a tremendous amount of progress and my social anxiety doesn’t make me hate myself quite so much anymore which means 4) it’s actually possible to surmount your social anxiety to the extent that it no longer consumes your life.nnI don’t think I’ll ever be free of social anxiety symptoms, but they no longer control me (most of the time). I hate social anxiety and it SUCKS, but I want you to know that you CAN make progress and that every time you do something that makes you uncomfortable, it gets a little easier. I love you all and please message me anytime you want to talk about SAD or whatever!! Sorry for the long and wordy post!!",1

Relieved because I've been dealing with these social problems since I was like 10.nnI'm going to try to summarize what my social anxiety has been like. (english is not my native language so i'm sorry for the mistakes and bad grammar.)nnI have always been a calm, quiet girl, but I think it all started when I had an early puberty for my age. I had a lot of acne on my forehead so kids kinda bullied me at school, even teachers always asked me if i had an allergy or something, because it's not normal to have acne at 10! Since then I started to hate school and to be extremely self-conscious about myself. I was very ashamed of my acne and hated when people looked at me, because I thought they were looking at my forehead. I started to feel very uncomfortable when people looked at me, my face turned red and I looked away, I avoided talking to people so that they would not see my forehead. I even once cut bangs and used my mom's makeup to hide the pimples but it just got worse. Although now at 14 I no longer have acne (thanks to taking isotretinoin) that just marked me a lot and now I am not the same. I had a friend but she moved to another city, and now I literally have no friends.nnSo the pandemic was the best thing that happened to me (even tho at first i skipped zoom classes because i was scared of having to turn on the camera so I always pretended I had connection problems, and when we did breakout rooms i just left the meeting). I enjoyed the time locked up a lot but the consequences of not interacting with anyone directly, literally NO ONE of my age during almost two years were very bad.nnI recently went back to school and it's hell for me. Every morning I feel a strong pain in my stomach from nerves, and when I'm in the class it's horrible because I feel like everyone is looking at me, judging me. And the worst thing is that a few days later this boy (who bullied me before the pandemic) came and asked me if i was mute. He calls me ''antisocial'' when he sees me. Those comments like: -Are you dumb? Why do you never speak? Do you not like me? Do you have autism or something? really annoys and hurt me.nnThere is a girl I kinda know and I have lunch with her just to not eat alone, but when we leave the cafeteria it's very uncomfortable because I stay there standing like a stupid without saying anything, and that makes me hate myself, I always think: -why can't i act normal and just have a properly conversation? It's supposed to be easy.- I can't integrate myself into the conversation with her other friends and my voice is always hoarse when i try to say something (trust me, i've tried hard) , so now I go to the bathroom. What I used to do was to go to the library during break but now I can't go because of the covid it's closed so I don't have a choice. I'm scared of staying outside and reading a book, because everyone sits down with their group of friends in a circle and i feel like they judge me when they see me alone (i've tried it but i just cant focus reading.) and surely that boy will come and tell me antisocial and all bullshit.nnGoing to school to me is like, as soon as I walk in, I become a totally different person. I can't express emotions or speak for fear of how people will react, even when I write or eat i feel extremely uncomfortabable because I do not know where to look at, what facial expression to do (some people have told me i look angry) I can't look anyone in the eye, and obviously in class i never participate (Group work sucks because I say anything, I feel like I worry too much about others that I forget to think and I can't say things assertively or opine, so they think I'm mediocre or something, that I don't want to work.)nnMy mom already knew about this and just said that it was because of my age, because I am a teenager, that my sister was the same and that it was going to pass quickly. But now that it has gotten worse she took me to the psychologist, at first I didn't tell the doctor what I had been feeling but then I was able to tell her most of it. My mother also took me to a psychiatrist to have a presential appointment (because my psychologist does not live in my city) and after some sessions she formulated this Prozac medication for me. My mom was surprised, because I feel like she still thinks I'm just shy and that's it, and she was against me taking medicine. She doesn't want me to be dependent of a medicine and she says that i just have to talk more because that's what humans do, communicate with others, and that my future is going to be hard if i continue like this. I think my dad doesn't even know I go to the psychologist.nnBut recently my mom has been supportive, I know she just wants to help me. Already started taking the medicine about two days ago, and I was kinda happy that she prescribed it to me because I hope it will help me along with the therapy. But I'm also worried because what if it doesn't work? I think it just helps with the symptoms because clearly I'm not going to be a social butterfly from night to day just by taking that, I know I have to do an effort to socialize. and also I've read about the side effects and stuff. Anyway, I know this is very long and probably no one is going to read it, I just wanted to vent by writing this. and if someone has taken this medication maybe you could share how you felt:)",1

7407,"kkou_78","post","I hope this helps someone","So I've been having CBT for the last month for both my GA and SA and honestly, it's helping a lot. She's given me lots of activities to help identify my thoughts etc. Her advice to me has been amazing and she's given me some techniques for when I feel awkward and uneasy in a social situation.nnI thought I'd list some of the things I've been doing, I hope it might help someone. I do highly recommend that you see a therapist for CBT as well because the chats in each session after doing the tasks are helpful and she's always helped me to view my thoughts in a different way.nnSo here are the tasks I did:nn**Week 1: Thought journal -** So every time I had an anxious thought I would write it down. I did this for a week, and then my therapist started to ask me if those thoughts are ""Hypothetical"" or ""Current"".nn**Week 2: Worry awareness training -** This week I had to choose 3 times in the day (I did 8am, 2pm, and 8pm) - I would ask myself ""Am I worrying?"" If I was I would write a short sentence of that worry and identify if it's Hypothetical or Current.nnThese two tasks helped me to identify if a lot of my anxious thoughts were hypothetical or current. Most of the time for me they were hypothetical as I would constantly have thoughts about things that haven't happened like going to Mcdonalds let's say, and ordering something and then I stutter or lose my words.nn**Week 3: Safety behavior -** In this session, I had to identify safety behaviors that made me avoid situations where anxiety was intense. For me, I learned that my GA was based on having the future be predictable, and in a social situation, it was a way of feeling less awkward and relaxed.nni.e I have anxiety over driving so I would pick places that were super familiar and only drive there or I would only use routes that I know. I would also use maps to check the lanes etc.nnWith social situations it was writing a script, rehearsing, and using my phone.nnWith this knowledge, I put situations that give me intense anxiety into a hierarchy and start to tackle them without using any of my safety behaviors and avoiding creating new ones.  I did this for about 2 weeks. This is an ongoing activity as I'm encouraged every week to work on these and get exposure. So at the moment for me, I've been tackling talking on the phone without a script and rehearsing, and I've also been driving new routes. It's still really hard but I've been starting to feel a lot better.nn**Week 4: Taking my thoughts to court -** This session was about discussing how anxiety can be positive and with this task, my therapist listed a few statements and I had to pick some that I felt related to me. Then I would list reasons why this statement is true and reasons why this statement is false. A lot of the time I actually couldn't answer why it was true. nnHere are some I picked:nn· Worrying can prevent negative outcomesnn· Worrying prevents me from being in dangernn· Worrying can provide solutions to problemsnn**Week 5 - Problem Solving -** In this session, she taught me steps to solve current worries with problem-solving. nnHere are the steps :   nn1. Identify Clear and Precise Problem: nn2. Identify many solutions to the problem: nn3. Pros and cons for each solution:nn4. Pick a solution:nn5. Implement Solution:nn6. Review the solution:nn**Week 6 - Imaginal Exposure -** This is a technique I've just learned and have yet to try myself. It's the most important for me because my anxiety and negative thoughts have been based on hypothetical scenarios.nnSo this task is when I have a worrying thought that is hypothetical, I have to write down   nn""If that happened what would happen next:"" and then I'm to drill down to get to the bigger root of the problem. nnExample for me: When I get to a busy roundabout and I can't find a gap, I'm worried that the driver behind will get impatient and beep at me. nnWhat happens next: I'm going to lose focus, or feel embarrassed or angry by the situation. What happens next: Next time I drive I'm going to feel more pressure. What happens next? I could rush due to the feeling of pressure and pull out at the wrong time and have an accident. What happens next? I or the other driver could be badly hurt, and our cars could be a write-off.nnSo now I have to write this up in as much detail as possible -- detailed almost like a short novel with all the senses. Once I have a clear picture that I can imagine. I have to record myself reading this and listen back to it for 20 minutes a day and continue till the anxiety has lessened when I think of this scenario. nnThat's all I have for now. I really hope this can help someone -- I know in some places therapy may not be an option because it's costly. So I hope that these tasks can help you in some way like they have for me.  I definitely recommend you see a therapist if you can as they can go into a lot more detail with you and the tasks may be more tailored to your anxiety.",1

7443,"sjpthatsme","post","Overcoming Physical Symptoms of Social Anxiety","Let me start this post by saving this is my first post on Reddit. I have been reading on here for years and so many of you have helped me in life so I want to return the favor.nI have had social anxiety since I was in middle school. I’m 25 now and am completing my senior year of college. In a variety of social settings, I would experience increased heart rate, very noticeable facial sweating, blushing, shaky voice, trouble breathing, the whole nine yards. This has happened to me at work, school, with my own family, with friends. Situations that were of main concern include presentations, work, interviews, dates, hanging out with friends without being drunk, ect. Incredibly embarrassing and it sure does make you want to avoid being around people even when you’re feeling lonely. How irrational, right? Well a year or so into college, I started seeing a therapist and doing cognitive behavioral therapy, which did help some, but did not really do it for me. It was basically exposure to my fears and learning to change my thought patterns. He would have me stand up in front of him and give a presentation, and then add one more person to the room and do the same presentation. I only made it up to two people in the room lol but I DID feel a reduction in anxiety and increase in confidence. I also took a public speaking class (35 people in the class) but was only able to give presentations calmly by taking Xanax and propanoIol together. I just couldn’t risk embarrassing myself in front of all of those people. This combination worked wonders. One is for the physical symptoms of anxiety, and the other is for the mental symptoms (try it, it will work I promise!). I even faced my fears and got a job as a server at Chili’s which did help as well but did not fully diminish my fears of embarrassment. I’ve also tried SSRIs, weight lifting, running, meditation, yoga. SSRIs we’re terrible. The others did reduce anxiety and I still do them today, but attacks were still happening. What made me really get to a point of being CURED where I DO NOT consider myself to have social anxiety anymore, is what I really want to share. First, let me say that EVERYONE experiences social anxiety to some extent, even if it is very minimal. We all worry about how we look and sound to some degree. It’s just built into us, a survival mechanism. BUT, people with social anxiety amplify the anxiety by reassuring themselves that if their feared social situation did happen, the world would end, and all hope would be lost. And so they avoid it. They would just feel disappointment, and their reputation would be affected. And they are right to think that. These things may very well be true. But what I realized is this: so what? My story: It happened one day inside a guitar center believe it or not… I had to wait at a checkout with people behind me while they went to grab a keyboard stand from the back. They took forever and of course, that little thought popped up: “shit, I sure hope I don’t start sweating.” Sure enough, sweat started streaming down my face, sooooo much sweat. I was panicking and seconds felt like minutes. I felt so embarrassed and sooooo uncomfortable. I wanted it to end. But then I asked myself: What am I going to do, fight or flight? That’s what my body is preparing for right now. Screw it, I said to myself. I’m sweating, so what? Who cares? Nobody even said anything about it. The cashier acted as if nothing happened. And even if someone did notice or say something, I could just tell them I blush/sweat easily all the time, I could even say it happens randomly, especially when I’m stressed out. After that realization, I became completely calm in about 30 seconds. I still had sweat dripping off of me but the production of it stopped. I chose to not let it bother me. Ever since that day, it happened less and less. And each timed, I asked myself so what? I’m stressed out, it’s normal for this to happen. NOT caring if my worst fear DOES happen and remaining in that situation WHEN it happens (instead of running), is the cure to social anxiety! Fight or flight? It’s your choice. You have to continuously do this daily and you will notice it happens less and less often. Eventually the physical symptoms stopped happening, and I wouldn’t care if they did happen. I refuse to give them control of my life. The only thing I still struggle with is presentations in front of large groups (which I take medication for still). But I know one day I will have the courage to risk embarrassment for those too! I used to sweat/panic just getting a haircut, so I know how debilitating social anxiety can be. The switch of worrying to not caring will only happen when you experience the feared mental/physical anxiety DURING that situation and you REMAIN in it until calm. New neural pathways begin to form and each time you do not leave the situation, the pathway is deepened. Your ability to remain and decide in that anxious moment that whatever is happening is not as important as you overcoming social is the key here. It’s very important. Just like a muscle, it must be trained. Become a master at it. Bored? Go train. If I can do it, so can you. I know this post was long, but this is my story and my only wish is that this story helps spread the message that social anxiety IS curable, even in the most severe cases. Thanks for reading!",1

7458,"JisungTaro","post","Hi everyone! New member here! :)","Long read :( nnI'm an Asian 23F soon to be 24. A little back story, I've always been the shy, quiet, introverted, normal girl but that all changed junior year of high school after getting bullied for being the shy, quiet and introverted girl LOL. A group of kids just got a kick out of how I would react when being put on the spot and they realized if they stared at me long enough throughout class I would become flustered. I blushed easily so what was my solution to that? A LOT OF MAKE UP. I looked like an actual clown. I cringe about it to this day but in my 16 year old head I thought I would rather get made fun of for how much foundation I had than people seeing me turn into a tomato. nnSo that's how my social anxiety happened. I didn't like attention, I didn't like eye contact, I didn't like interacting with anyone for fear of them judging me and witnessing an embarrassing sight. This lead me to overthink EVERYTHING. I resorted to safety behaviors which meant staying home most of the time but it got bit better when I was 19 years old. My aunt had this store that she needed help running and because she spoke very limited English she pulled my ass in to help. I thought it was a one week thing but I ended up staying there for 4 years. The first year was brutal but as the years went by these interactions came a lot easier. During this time I was able to get my first job as a barista/cashier and get my drivers license. Two things I never thought I would be able to do. I worked at a boba shop and it wasn't busy so it was easier to manage and the place was close by so driving there was also okay (I also have driving anxiety...). A year went by and I decided to quit and add to my resume after my cousin referred me to work as a front desk receptionist at an optometrist office. That was probably the worst decision of my life. The work environment was extremely toxic. The people that ran the office micromanaged everything, evaluated you on everything. Spoke condescendingly to you and made you feel incompetent...it was hell. I wanted to quite but for my cousin's sake, I didn't want to make him look bad. I was there for about 5 months when the pandemic happened. It was a blessing in disguise for me because it meant a break from all that. I was preparing myself to go back in after a few weeks but it spanned 5 months. I knew they would call me in eventually but thought of going back scared the absolute crap out of me. I eventually got the call and after two weeks of being there I put in my two weeks notice because just as I expected, I couldn't handle it. Before, I was able to put up a front and tell my self to stop being a little bitch and to do what I was told to do and leave. Not the best coping mechanism but it's what got me through. Now, I was now holding back tears in the break room and crying while driving home after every shift. I quit and I focused on school which was still all held online at the time. I couldn't even do an online presentation for one my classes because of how bad my anxiety got. It didn't even require me to turn on the camera, just audio and I couldn't do it. The pandemic that I thought was a blessing in disguise turned out to be the opposite. I feel like from 19-22 I made progress and now I'm back at where I started but this time older and more expectations and pressure from family and society now that I graduated. I also forgot to mention that I dropped two toxic friends along the way. I only have one friend now but we have our issues too. She's understanding and I share a lot with her but...I don't get that closeness like I did with the other two friends. It's weird. I feel alone and I want to make more friends but making friends as an adult is rough and it's even harder when you don't go out and think everyone hates you lol. nnI actually went to see a psychiatrist yesterday because it was getting a bit much for me. A lot of ruminating thoughts and a lot of questions like, ""How the hell am I expected to live a decent life if I can't do simple things like x, y, and z?"" Fear turned into anger and I really don't want to keep living like this anymore. I graduated and I need to get on with life. I need to either find a job or go back to school to pursue higher education. I haven't decided on either yet but the main thing holding me back is my social anxiety. My psychiatrist told me that exposure therapy is what I need to do. I need to embrace that rush I get and become conditioned to get use to doing things like driving, talking to people, doing things by myself, etc. I was also prescribed Lexapro, and propranolol. I haven't picked them up yet but he said that these are here to hopefully help kickstart my journey but everything else is willpower and motivation. I can't say I have any of that right now but sharing all of this does help a bit..nnIf you got through all that, thank you. If not, I understand because this is extremely long lol. nnAnyways, if anyone is like me and needs an online friend I'm here! My main hobbies and interests include kpop and cooking :) \~ I also have a kpop twt account if you feel more comfortable talking there\~",1

I'm nowhere near nowhere near knowing my shit AT ALL so take everything I'm saying with a grain of salt, I'm just another confused boy, just trying to say that I have *some* experience taking these kinda drugs (this for people who might think of taking them as well WHICH I DO NOT RECOMMEND)..nnClonazepam; It's absolutely fucking incredible. I'm semi-doubting whether I should be posting this here because you guys (fuck that, *we* guys) are susceptible to this kinda shit so I don't want to get anyone to try it or even get hooked (which is VERY VERY easy and withdrawals are worse than hell) but I have to share this experience.nnFuck not having anxiety and not being reserved, this shit made me above anyone and everyone in terms of sociability. Zero, *zero* anxiety or any restrainment in any social situation. I've been to school, out in the street and to a party during this period and all of it was *awesome*. I've talked to people, girls who I had never talked to. No anxiety, pure pleasure and happiness being completely free and crutchless. I struck up a conversation with someone who is clearly dealing with the exact same issues that us and that made me so happy because I know if that were me, I'd be fucking ecstatic to have someone walk up to me and share their point of view and just come out and say they're also dealing with issues.nnPlease, anyone reading this get the fuck out there right fucking now and get help. Life without SA is like being on every stimulant drug *all the time*. Get help, get cured. Living with SA is not the way to live. There are tons and tons of way to get yourself better.

Even the trial could help you realize some stuff about you personally and your anxiety. SA is absolutely not something that can not be dealt with. It can be, easily, but you have to put in the work (which I realize can be very hard. It was and still is to me).nnAlso, please please please don't resort to drugs (*especially* benzos which is what Clonazepam is). They're very very addictive; one physically; two mentally because they do EXACTLY what you want them to do - get rid of anxiety. Use drugs as instructed by your therapist to ease the pain *while* you get treated for long term well being.nnI'm ranting and mumbling incoherent shit probably, but please, there's so much more to life being shy, quiet and anxious all the time which has been my entire life.

I feel like an angrily kicked, stubbed toe at the moment, but it helps someone else else sigh in relief because they are off slightly better. Maybe someone can relate. Maybe someone has a an actual time machine to sell. nnHello World. nnI'm 22 and only feel safe at home with the doors closed, lights dim. I live with my parents, with three college to high school aged siblings, waitress and play on the computer pretending to work.nnI want a time machine. I have ten thousand dollars, but can scrounge up another six thousand if I sell everything from my car to a kidney. Does anyone have an offer?nnWhy do I need it? The truth is ugly, but if can convince anyone, I’ll rip off the band aid and explain.nnI failed all 3/3 college courses this semester. I could have graduated after this, but I only showed up for one class. The money is wasted, academic probation is harassing, my parents think I pulled through, and a lot of people at the college are frowning and saying what a dimwit.nnThe machine must be able to at least travel back before October 13, 2015. The was the last day that I could have dropped out for the semester, when I last panicked, telling myself I would lose all  financial aid for the future if I did. However, one that can travel back three to five years would be best.nnI don’t want to change anything leaving high school, except maybe, that I never placed top ten in a State Championships. My best placing was eleventh, top ten got medals. I won’t name the sport. Still, I graduated a class of a hundred as Valedictorian, top in every subject, an athletic state competitor, and active in too many clubs to even list. I went into college with enough credits to bypass almost all freshman year course requirements, and had worked that summer on research with a professor. I was pretty well set.nnFreshman year 2011: this is where I want to restart. I made the first mistake choosing my second major to be physics. I worked hard, found great friends, got A’s in all my other courses. But, physics was never my strong suit, and although curious, I should not have pursued it.nnIf the clock turning device cannot go back that far, then the next preference is for August, 2014: Junior Year. I had just got an apartment with friends, and was still clinging to that double major, though I had C’s in most physics courses. Everything else was still straight A’s. How dumb and naïve I was! I ended up drafted into two major club positions (a presidency and vice presidency), and took a job at school.nnI imploded. I failed a lab course that semester, almost dragging my lab partner down with me. In both club positions I did hardly any work, then lied like the scientist who fudges his results. nI spent that fall slowly crashing, hiding in my room, stealing my roommate’s food and binge eating. The next semester, I was certain I’d be found out, that my lab partner would turn my classmates against me, I would have to come clean to my parents about a failing grade. Everyone wondered where I went. I ignored them. Too scared and shamed to show my face on campus, I skipped the first two weeks and dropped out.nnI stayed in the apartment. Got fat. My money became low, but the school mailed a check for refunded courses. It was my parents’ money. I used to fight with them to pay my own way, but I stole that three thousand dollars, and didn’t come clean about it until the spring. nnI did get a job then, at a gas station, moved back home (which was half an hour away), took two local community college courses, aced them, and saw a psychologist for a few months so that I could get back into school the next spring. I switched to a waitressing job, dropped the double major. That semester I did well in classes, two As and two Bs.nnIf I had taken the courses two years ago, I would have gotten all As. I lied to my parents saying they were the great grades again. nThis summer I turned 22. At second to latest, I would like to restart the clock in August. nnI thought my life was back this summer. I worked as many days as I could, on other days, I went hiking and to the beach with old high school friends and new ones I made at work. I was in the best weight and shape in years, and was starting to reconnect old friends. nnThe trouble was I needed one research course for graduation, and I needed to ask professors to oversee the credits. I got shot down twice, and never signed up for the course. I again became embarrassed showing my face on campus. I went the first day of classes, to one class and never went back.nnI pretended to everyone that I was in college. I never dropped out, even though by the end of September I knew I should.  nnI know it's pathetic. I’m a loser, at home while my old friends are off living across the US making their way. I stole non trivial amounts of money from my parents, and wasted the tuition they paid. In November I got worry emails from college about my nonattendance. I ignored them, and now it’s January.  I’ve been telling my parents that I missed two credits and that’s why I haven’t graduated.

7606,"GeneWilderGoneWilder","post","Heard my ""friends"" talk shit behind my back","I just need to vent a little, sorry for the long post. If you have any advice for me, I would really appreciate it.nnI'm a 22 year old college student who recently transferred to a school in Philadelphia. I've had social anxiety for a while now and have also been in therapy for depression. Since past year I've really tried hard at improving myself and dealing with social anxiety, but I'm afraid the experience I had last week reverted all my progress.nnWhen I moved into the apartment, I thought my roommate and I were getting along pretty well. We had been going out to bars, studying together, smoking weed, playing video games and just generally hanging out in the apartment.nnThis is when that perception changed. Last week my roommate invited me to go to a concert with him and three of his friends (who I know and have hung out with in the past). I accept, we made plans to pick up some weed, but we also picked up some MDMA. This was my first time trying MDMA, but I had always heard that it made you feel good, so I didn't worry too much about it. A couple days later we go to the concert, I take about 300mg of MDMA (which admittedly might have been too much for my first time), and have a really good time. I honestly thought we had become really good friends, in part because they told me so. When we got home I was starting to feel the comedown, so I smoked ""enough weed to pass out"" at my roommate's suggestion (which was also a bad idea considering weed never made me feel relaxed, only paranoid), said my goodbyes, and went back to my room to sleep.nnI closed my door and just lied down on the bed since I couldn't sleep. After about 10 minutes or so is when I started hearing my name coming from the other room. I listened in on their conversation and found out they were saying things like:nnFuck that guynnHe's fake as hell (which is funny since I've never lied to them and had no reason to, maybe they were referring to my social anxiety?)nnWhy does he pretend to know sports (another ridiculous thing they said. I've played sports my entire life, watch the NFL and the NBA religiously, and even took sports marketing courses in the past.)nnWhy did you invite him outnnWhat's wrong with his hair? Who has that hairstyle anymore?nnHe wants to become a -------? He's a loser and he'll never get into that school.nnWhy did you let him move in with you (to my roommate)? (To which he replied) I made a mistake.nnIs he hearing us right now? Hey ------------! Whatever I don't give a shit if he hears us.nnAt this point I become aware of the fact that they're trying to listen in on me to see if I'm passed out. Not my fault they were speaking so loud and I was literally in the next room. I could still hear even if I tried not to.nnSo I got up and made another mistake that night. I went over to their room to confront them. As soon as I got up I could hear them saying ""oh shit is that him?"" I go over there and the door's locked. After they let me in I tried to talk but was so fucked up from the drugs that I literally, physically could not speak. So I sat there almost all night and into the day while the three of them tried to convince me that I had imagined all of it. That I was going through a bad trip. Which was even more insulting to me than them talking shit about me because yes, I was pretty fucked up, and yes I probably imagined a little of what they said since I was extremely paranoid to the point where I couldn't move or breathe properly. But I know what I heard and it wasn't hard to hear their conversation.nnThings have been pretty awkward since then. They still deny that any of that happened, and I'm for sure not going to accept that I was delirious. Is there a possibility that I imagined some of it? Sure. But I've talked to my roommate since then and he slowly started admitting to things that they denied saying that night. And even though my roommate talked shit about me as well, I still think he's a really nice guy. I can tell when we bring up the incident, that he makes a really guilty face like he wants to tell me something. I'm trying not to hold any grudges against him since I still have to live with him for the next 5 months.nnIf they were so adamant before that they didn't care that I was listening, why couldn't they just say that shit to my face? That would have been much less insulting to me because then I would know how to handle the situation, make apologies if needed, try to work through the problem or decide not to, etc. They very adamantly told me they liked having me around. I don't believe them after what I heard, but if that were true, how does that make any sense? Maybe I'm just inexperienced, but I've never had a relationship where you keep hanging out with someone even if you don't like having them around. That's not a good situation for anyone. If I'm being honest with myself and to them, I admit that I haven't been fully open with them. I'm an introvert, a quiet guy, and still trying to work through my social anxiety, so I may come off as fake because I'm still at the early stages of trying to ""fake it till I make it."" But everything I've told them was the truth.nnSo what do I do now? I've tried finding a new place to live but nothing's available at my price range that's not a shithole or not too far from campus. Should I just ignore it, never bringing it up again, and just do my own thing from now on? They still invite me out to shit but I've been turning them down, since I think they just feel obligated to invite me. What do?nn**TLDR** : roommate and his friends talked shit about me behind my back after rolling. Confronted them about it but they denied everything and tried to turn it around on me. Life sucks and everything is awkward.nnPs: I know at least one of them is on reddit. If you find this just fucking talk to me about it. You don't even have to be nice about it. Just be a fucking man and say it to my face.",1

7615,"TfwScreechingCheeses","post","First therapy appointment in a year","I've been struggling with severe social anxiety and selective mutism for about 13 years now. I am 18. My earliest memories are of being excluded from groups and being very shy, normally playing on my own or in small groups for fear of not fitting in. That was in my earlier grades of elementary school, grades 1-3. I was also very quiet in kindergarden, and when I would make noise I would get in trouble from the teacher. I think I may have attributed making noise to getting in trouble and being unliked. nnIn grades 3-4 it got slightly better once I moved schools, but those grades are almost a blur. Once I moved schools again part way through grade 4, I got quiet again. I never talked at school, maybe a few words a year. I was bullied relentlessly for any reason the other kids could come up with, this went on for 4 years and I got increasingly more socially anxious and mute as the bullying increased. The abuse from my mother and her boyfriend made the insecurities much worse.nnHighschool came, I am still unsure how I managed to make friends. I had my only friend from public school follow me to highschool. The group grew slowly from there, but my social anxiety still got worse. I am still very mute in most classes, with lots of teachers only hearing my voice to ask questions in private.nnI had set up a therapy appointment to finally get a hold of the anxiety before I go to college next year. I was told he specializes in mindfulness, and although I had a bad previous experience with it, I decided to try this therapist. I met with him today for the first appointment.nnI was obviously very quiet at first, and he pointed out how I was anxious. Like of course I'm anxious, but I was okay with that, I agreed because I need to open myself up. He asked what my anxiety was like in the waiting room, and I ranked it about 4/10 because I use the waiting room for many other appointments. My anxiety with him was 8/10.nnHe asked me about my past, what sort of things I wanted to work on (I said SA and PTSD), and started talking about his approach. Throughout the appointment I got more comfortable, much more than I have ever gotten with a therapist, even the one at school that I have seen for almost 4 years now. His approach to mindfulness is actually so amazing, it's closer to CBT than the mindfulness I had experienced before. He is going to teach me how to take control of the anxious thoughts and I am feeling really optimistic about this therapist.nnBy the end of the appointment, I was sitting up instead of curling myself into a ball, I wasn't fidgeting with every item I could find, I wasn't clenching my jaw which I do almost constantly at school and home. I had actually opened up a bit, and laughed a bit, and smiled, when normally I stay completely closed up. Even on the way home, I was relaxed on the city bus, I didn't stare at the ground the whole time, and I was thinking about his words the whole way, and still am.nnFor the first time in very long, I feel optimistic about controlling my social anxiety. I guess I am sharing this both as a huge win on my part, and a motivation for any of you that even the worst case scenario of social anxiety can get better. Obviously I'm not better, but I feel like I can be better.",1

I feel like there is no future for me.nnnI think I've had social anxiety all my life. Unfortunately for me, I didn't really realize it until i turned about 17. When I was younger, I always thought i was just shy. Whenever I was around anyone, be it ""friends"", or even just my family, I feel like i'm being judged on everything I do or say. My whole body heats up, my my heart starts going, I start shaking, start sweating profusely, and genuinely feel like i'm going to die with almost every social interaction. I even get my symptoms from talking to people online. Whether it be through text chats, or voice, I get anxious.  nnIn elementary school, I was the quiet kid who barely spoke. Sure i had some people who I would consider to be my friends at the time, but i really don't know why they would consider me their friend. Whenever i would hang out with someone, I was just really there. I didn't say much, didn't give any reactions to anything really. I hated, and still hate having to give my opinions on things. I always wanted someone else to suggest something, so i could just go along with it, and give a yes or no answer to. Anything deviating from me having to go in a lengthy response triggers my anxiety.nnNo matter who i'm talking to, my anxiety is the same. It could be my brother, mom, dad, anyone and my anxiety just goes. I hate feeling like this and I really want to change, but looking back on my life and going forward, I don't see how I can possibly change. It was so bad from elementary - high school, that i started doing all my classes online. All my life I've basically spent at my computer. Everyday i'm on my computer for probably 14+ hours each day. My life has been spent on my computer since middle school, and I hate every minute of it.nnWhen i graduated high school, I decided i wanted to make a change, and actually go to a school instead of attending classes online. So when I finally did, things got extremely worse for me. Everyday in class I felt like everyones eyes were on me. The entire class periods, I was anxious, and couldn't wait to leave. I had been trying to deal with my anxiety through exposure, until I got a group project. When I was assigned a group project, i panicked. Having to actually talk to a group of people, and present my ideas to them and the class terrified me, and still does. I was able to get through the project and present my idea to my group. However when it came to presenting our project to the class, I couldn't even do it. The day before we were supposed to present, I threw up about 5 times throughout the day. I'm not sure if me throwing up was anxiety related, or if it was from some type of food poisoning ( although I ate the same things as my dad did and he seemed fine), but I was so glad when i had an excuse to miss my presentation. After that happened to me, I got a new symptom of my anxiety. Acid reflux. nnSurprisingly I was able to finish that semester, but it was however my last. After that whole ordeal, I reached a whole new low. I couldn't believe how pathetic I was. I started just using my computer all day again, and lived my life through games. It took me a few months to get back into a mindset where I wanted to change. So I finally told my parents about my anxiety, and made a doctors appointment. The doctors prescribed me diazepam, and I had hoped that it would solve all my anxiety problems. That first time i took one of my pills, I felt like a whole new person. It was mind boggling. I couldn't believe how different it was. When I tried taking the pills on a day when i'd have some social interaction, they seemed to hardly work at all. I still had all the symptoms, and i feel like I started to get worse because this was supposed to me my ticket out of social anxiety.nnnafter finishing the first initial prescription, i went back to the doctors to try and get some advice, or something stronger that would actually suppress my anxiousness. They gave me a refill ( that still hasn't been touched), and I got a recommendation for a psychologist. Unfortunately that didn't work out well for me. even with the type of insurance I have, i can't afford it. Besides the cost, the actual psychology wasn't helping me at all. I tried the breathing techniques, all the exercises, mindfulness, none of it seems to help me. nnThat leads me to now. Waiting for my referral for a psychiatrist to come in, and feeling very depressed. I have no idea what to do. Everyday I just wake up and use my computer for the entire day, then i eventually cry myself to sleep. If i ever start to think about my life like i am now while writing this post, I start to feel like my life is pointless. I just can't see myself going on like this anymore though. I'm 20, almost 21, can't drive, never had a job, and basic human interactions terrify me.

7697,"HandMeABeer","post","Hi reddit, I'm new to this subreddit and I think I have social anxiety disorder. (long)","Hi everybody! I'm 25 years old male and a graduate student. I have a fairly fulfilling life in a top ten program for my particular area of science, a wonderful and supportive girlfriend of close to a year, a range of unique hobbies, and a fairly active lifestyle (I generally try to workout at least every other day). All of that sounds great, except for the huge elephant in the room: I've never felt particularly emotionally stable. On the outside, a lot of people characterize me as highly extraverted: I enjoy going out for drinks or other social activities with friends a few times a week, I can carry on conversations fairly well on a one-to-one basis, and I was even president of my graduate student program for a year. nnOn the inside, though, I know there's always been something about me that's... off. Several examples:nn* I live in a house with 3 other guys. Whenever any of them are in the living room, I will hide out in my room until I know nobody's in there. If all three of them are in there, I try to make it look like I'm not there at all-- sit still, lights off, etc. I have a small fridge in my room so I don't starve.nn* Colloquially, I often plan my schedule (flexible work hours) around when I know nobody will be home. But I also plan my schedule often around when I know few people will be in my office (shared office space, desks very close proximity with 6 people total). The result: I often unnecessarily work nights and weekends. nn* I'm extremely critical of myself. I take innocuous jokes too literally and always assume there's a hint of judgment. I always assume that people are talking about me behind my back, negatively. If I don't get invited somewhere, I always assume it's because I don't matter and it'd be more fun if I wasn't there. I assume if somebody doesn't talk to me, it's because I'm not interesting enough for them. It's a vicious cycle: I get quiet because I feel like I'm not wanted at a social event. People start probing about why I'm so quiet. I become more self conscious.nn* My girlfriend is the most honest, sweet person I've ever known. I have this secret fear that she's going to find somebody better than me and leave me.nn* I can't summon the courage to tell my roommate that his music is too loud at 2 AM, so I don't.nn* The prospect of phone calls and texts is terrifying, and I often put off returning them as long as possible.nn* My lab coworkers have criticized me because I never hang out with them outside of lab and I must think I'm better than them. I don't have the heart to tell them that I get anxious around them and I never feel included when I do things with them. nnIt's hard for me to wrap my mind around, but I'm coming to terms that this makes sense. I've spent my entire life thinking there was something wrong with me and that me being quiet or not being super exciting was a flaw with myself. My parents never believed in psychological disorders and that feeling sad was a weakness, so I never really considered the possibility.nnI've been seeing a therapist about this for a few years on and off and I don't feel like I've made positive strides. I've never had any major panic attacks, but I have broken down in front of people before. My girlfriend has asked me if she can talk to somebody in her family about resources to help me, but I've told her not to because I'm afraid their perception of me will change for the worst. I'm too scared to tell other people because I'm afraid of the knowledge spreading around. I don't want people to know about what's going on with me, yet I get frustrated when people can't tell that there's something wrong with me.nnI want to repress these feelings and live a more normal life. I'm not really looking for advice or anything (if only there was a cure all!) but I just wanted to share and get this all out in writing. Sorry about the long post, but if you read all the way, you're awesome and I thank you. Even if you didn't read it all, you're awesome anyway. ",1

Even now I feel like I can't concentrate or focus on my studies, or I daydream a lot, I am always tired, and sometimes I don't want to do basilar things like cleaning my house. some days it takes a lot of effort, but I do this activities because I live with my parents and I don't want them to be concerned. I oversleep, when I'm very depressed I don't have appetite, I eat less and I lost two pounds.. I have suicidal thoughts too, they come and goes. I think my depression comes and goes too, because there are days when I'm happy, usually when I'm with people. I'm not always sad. With my therapist I'm reflecting on the link between SA and depression. Which comes first? Maybe depression is like a secondary disease, maybe SA came first and made me isolated, wihtout friends, SO...so I felt depressed because I was isolated, lonely. But when I feel depressed, I don't experience anxiety. Usually I don't care at all about others. But in my situation I think I become depressed because I didn't like my life, with no friends, I felt isolated, I felt distant and different from others, plus SA made me quit some works experiences.

7741,"lwjp1995","post","Social Anxiety diagnosis","So this is the first I've ever really opened up about my self diagnosed social anxiety, but I have decided to start working on trying to fix it. nn(21 M)nSo basically I am completely socially inept at pretty much everything. I can't hold a conversation with friends or family, something which my parents are forever going on at me about. Every time we head out I get a lecture about how I need to talk to people and join in the conversation. The thing is I want to be able to join in with conversations and be normal, it's just mentally getting pass some invisible wall. I can't look people in the eyes when I talk, which is generally only in response to a question. This is usually a 3 word/ 1 sentence response before I try and shut them out stop the conversation. I dunno why, but I feel as bough everyone thinks of me as a cold, dead, emotionless husk that occupies a human body. I have only really deliberated on this as I have just finished my university degree, and looking back I just hate how isolated I am. I managed to hang out for 2 nights during freshers before everyone in my flat/people I know just started hanging out without me. That I think was the lowest point in life, I spent the whole first term just going through the motions, get up, go to lectures, avoid people, go back. It got so bad that if I went to the kitchen to cook some food and someone was in there I would turn back and wait for them to finish so I could my food without feeling that I am being judged for what I am eating, or entering into another conversation I can't keep going. There are lots of things I want to do but I don't because I to afraid of what people will think of me, or I will have to break past being the new person. I even make plans to go and hang out with people but then end up not going without any explanation cause I don't want to respond. Then I end up having to deal with that issue the next time I see them, if I see them. I can't even go shopping and buy something I want without having to have a whole conversation in my head about how I talk/what I say to them. This also happens a lot even about hypothetical situations that never pan out. Never voluntarily asked/answered a question in class, even if I didn't understand because of how stupid I would sound. Even if I knew the answer I wouldn't do anything about it. If I'm walking with friends I'm always the person that hangs on the outside so ya easier to not be seen. Additionally, I can't just simply drink my problems away cause I don't want/like to get drunk and do/say something that I regret, which gives me loads of weird looks/comments about how I need to ""loosen"" up and live a little. In fact, I got drunk once when I was working in Ireland, living in some random persons home while I completed some work experience I needed to finish my course, and I ended up just completely breaking down with this one person, but I couldn't face them after that cause the next day I felt bad for ruining their night, couldn't even have the courage to say sorry for being such a mess. When I do hang out with friends for a night out, we usually have drinking games, namely 'never have I ever' which is always just bragging about your sex life. Anyway, I feel the constant need to compulsively lie about it to seem less boring, I've never even kissed a girl or asked a girl I like out cause I just don't know what to do. In fact one girl was talking to me and was just to pushy and made me feel uncomfortable, so I ended up making excuses saying it's my fault and nothing to do with her, and then ended up ignoring hanging out with my friends cause she was hanging out with them aswell. nnThe thing I believe that all started this.... Having to wear glasses. I was the only person in school who had to wear them, and I hated wearing them. My parents had to get the teachers to make me wear them only highlighting to the whole class how different I am. My poor eyesight and inability to wear glasses, stopped me from talking to people because I couldn't see them without having to squint and such, which just made me more self-conscious. So to cope, I buried myself in book, and gaming. Isolation in a nutshell. I spent the first three years of secondary school hiding in the library just to help get through the day. My parents always made me go out and do things as a kid, even if I didn't want to, and now I just don't want to do anything. I feel so lonely and weird, haven't even got the guts to tell anyone I know about this, or speak to my doctor for fear of them saying there is nothing wrong with me, I'm just being stupid. nnI'm so confused about whether I have social anxiety because I can give presentations and go through initial conversation stuff like ""hi, how are you?"" And other times I can't even cook food with someone in the room, and end up just waiting until like midnight when I know there is a very small chance of me bumping into my housemates.nnAnyway, I just wanted to get this all off of my chest, and find this way a lot easier than actually having to talk to someone face to face about it.nnEdit: I'm considering going through military to help me break my old self down and build a new person to help with my anxiety/awkwardness.

7775,"PoisonRhino","post","The lurker that ballsed up and made a post.","Like being born into riches, are the people (myself included) with SA meant to have it? I used to do tons of therapy sessions (CBT &amp; medicated) as I use to physically be unable to go anywhere without feeling violently ill. The medication (Apo-Sertraline) helped with some of the physical symptoms to the point that I could go out without feeling like I was about to die, but I still just lacked that natural confidence that so many people have in social situations.nnThis was about 7 years ago and I am now pretty much back to ""normal"". I don't feel sick all the time and can go out places with no ""issues"". I quote those 2 words because they are my normal and my issues. Until recently I wasn't even aware of this but I did a solo trip with psychedelics in complete darkness and came to some very strong realizations about SA.nnNormal for me is not normal for you. Normal for me is being able to go where I want without feeling physically ill. My issues are not your issues. My issues are how I overthink nearly any situation I find myself in. While in the darkness I thought about how maybe this is just how I am supposed to be. nnI had a very vivid thought about how when I was deep in my SA 7 years ago my mom used to call me crazy and to think more positive. Thinking positive when deep in SA panic attack is impossible for me. The negative thoughts that come from SA feel like they come from my subconscious. Seeing as I can not control my subconscious, trying to layer positive conscious thoughts over them is useless. It's like being in a plane that is about to crash and saying everything is okay. It's not!nnAnother thought I had was about how I always wanted to be the person that got asked to hang out. I hated being the one that had to make plans. This is a very easy situation to overthink as a direct result of SA. I think this situation alone amplified my SA to the point of panic attacks. I used to hang out with people every weekend and then I stopped asking people to hang out as I wanted to wait and see if they'd ask me. Well, it's been 7+ years, and they still haven't.nnMy trip down the rabbit hole has helped me so much though. I now realize that I am me. I used to wish I could be the person with all the friends but I now realize how bad that wish is. It takes anything unique about you and pushes it to the side. I finally understand ""just be yourself"". As weird as myself might be, I can finally say that I am happy and content. I went to a 5 day festival by myself and met so many awesome people that were genuinely interested in me. I didn't have to act different, I just was there dancing and smiling. Everything happened so naturally.nnEven though I don't have the confidence to attract the masses, I can finally say that I have the confidence to attract myself. I'm finally happy and accepting of my weirdness. I'm able to embrace it. I am ""just another freak"".nnI really hope everyone suffering from the loneliness that comes with SA can find a way past it. We all have lonely days, months, even years (in my case) but for me, it was just a matter of learning about who I was and how intangible the things that I wanted were. I am normal, and although I still have my ""issues"" they no longer cripple my thoughts.nnMuch Love",1

I fear practicing the music with close communication in my band more than playing in front of a crowd.

Social anxiety, intrusive/obsessive thoughts, maladaptive daydreaming, along with insomnia/lack of adequate sleep.nnLast night, like most for me, I only got about 3 hours of sleep. My mind races at night and I stay on the internet rather than sleep. Sleeping for me is more about calming my mind down rather than making my body relax and my mind races constantly. nnSo early this morning, my mom was making loud noises and she woke me up. No big deal, that's what she usually does. Then she said some inspectors were coming to the apartment and I had to hurry up and wake up and do some chore to prepare for the inspection. I complained that she should have told me to prepare the night prior. She continued to nag me. The next thing I knew, I had a complete meltdown. I threw a chair across the room, yelled at her to ""Just be quiet!"" and then a fell to the floor sobbing like a child. Clearly not a normal reaction for an adult being asked to do a chore. I feel so embarrassed but this is not the first time I have had an ""explosion"" toward her. There have been at least two similar incidents in the past but this one was pretty bad.nnThere are often SO many things swirling inside me; anger, frustration, sadness, hopelessness etc. I have no social life, my job isn't enough to get me out on my own, no driver's license, no boyfriend, no close relationship with family other than my mom. I've been dealing with obsessive thoughts off and on for a few months and they are always trying to return at night when I need to sleep. I think my temper tantrum this morning was just a combination of SO many issues I have being untreated while I look for a decent therapist. Things have gotten so bad for me that I am considering meds, despite being staunchly against them in the past.nnMy mom has always been a tremendous support system for me and I don't want to ruin that. I want to be out of her hair and on my own but financially, its impossible at the moment. I feel guilty that she has a ""crazy"" daughter who has these random fits. My mom deals with mental illness as well but hers is carefully controlled. I also have an aunt who explodes like this from time to time and I don't want to be anything like her.nnI just don't know how to get my mother to understand what goes on in my head. She only knows what I tell her and that's just the tip of the iceberg. I can apologize to her but I think she's fed up with me at this point. I just feel guilty and I wish I didn't have to live with her. I am normally able to suppress my emotions and carry on but it was just like a volcano erupting today.nnAny advice on how to address this with my mom? Like I said, she knows about my issues and I don't want her to think I was just trying to get out of doing a household chore. I'm not a bratty person, I simply need a lot of help. I don't want incidents like these to occur in the future. My mom always says a lack of sleep can make someone ""go crazy"" and I may be proving her right. I have a sleep aid that I can use but like I said, shutting my busy mind off is the real problem at night. Thankfully, I may have a therapy appointment coming up soon, which I desperately need.nnAny tips/advice would be helpful. Thank you. ",0

7891,"jakobiebryant1","post","Social anxiety and work? My story.","     Hey guys I'm new to this community and reddit in general. I thought it would be a good idea to share my story as well as ask for input. Just a heads up, this will be a lengthy post so be prepared for a long read. Skip to the last paragraph if you just want a summary. n     So I'm a 22 year old male who currently lives in an apartment with my girlfriend and couple hours away from my hometown. I work part time and am not currently enrolled in college classes. I took a couple semesters at a community college but haven't gone back for a few reasons. My social anxiety, and anxiety in general, as well as depression has been getting worse lately and it is starting to impede my daily life. n     So I'll start from the beginning. I grew up in Austin Texas in a normal suburban neighborhood. We were a pretty average middle class family, me being the youngest of 3 children. The big thing that set my family apart (in my eyes anyway) was the fact that my parents are extremely religious and they tried to shelter us as much as they could. I grew up functioning pretty normally although I was very shy and had some issues adjusting to new settings. I made a good group of friends from a young age and all seemed well. I didn't really notice my aversion to social situations until around middle school. It was just a habit from the beginning. n     So fast forward through elementary school. I was still rather normal, at least it appeared that way. I remember even at that young age I would have random bouts of depression. I didn't really recognize it for what it was, but at one point I was even contemplating suicide for virtually no reason. I would have periods of strong sadness when I wasn't distracted and would dread going to school a lot of the time. I still had a good group of friends but in classes where I didn't know anybody I would rarely talk and feel out of place. (Puberty is a bitch right?)n     So skip to high school. It was around my sophomore year where I really started noticing my anxiety and depression. I started smoking weed since a lot of my friends got into it, I actually really loved it for awhile but then it started making me even more aware of my faults and I started withdrawing from life in general. I didn't even realize I was a super quiet kid until around this time. Weird right? I guess my self awareness wasn't really where it should've been. When I did realize this, I became even more self conscious then I already was. I started questioning everything I did or said, I was so worried about how I looked to other people. I would get so focused on my appearance and posture and body language while speaking to others that I started talking even less. Self doubt was king. I was so trapped in my own head to the point where it would drive me crazy. The weed definitely wasn't helping this and I was smoking daily at this point. In hindsight, I think the marijuana triggered dormant mental issues or worsened them. I started turning to more drugs to self medicate. Any prescription pills I could get, uppers, psychedelics, you name it. n     At this point in my life my depression was also worsening along with my anxiety. I got officially diagnosed around 16 and was put on antidepressants and anti anxiety meds (non narcotic). I was becoming a wreck. My grades plummeted, I was getting into trouble at school, I got arrested multiple times, my relationship with my parents was awful. I had already had an issue with talking to them about anything, let alone emotions. My mom went crazy and basically tried to put me on lockdown but I would sneak out or just leave before she could say anything so I could go get high with my friends. My mental state was deteriorating rapidly. I could barely hold eye contact with anyone anymore, I felt so low and lesser than others. My friends (really drug buddies at this point, I broke away from my 'real friends' because they weren't getting fucked up) would always ask why I wasn't saying anything. There were some occasions where we would be smoking and hanging out and I would finally say something and someone would say something along the lines of ""holy shit I didn't even know you were here!"" n    Most of this was occurring during my junior year of high school. I could barely function at my part time movie theater job, I was a cashier a lot of the time and could barely look up from the register. My voice was so flat and unlively at work unless I was on pills that customers would constantly ask if I was OK. This would just send me further into the depths of my own head. I eventually lost the job because I called in constantly and came in really late one day because I read the schedule wrong and they let me go that day. I was skipping school so much that I got a truancy charge and had to go to court. I showed up barred out of my mind on Xanax and slurred some really dumb shit that I can't even remember to the judge and she ordered me to spend 3 days in jail on the spot. This was either my 2nd or 3rd time locked up within a year. I can't remember the exact timeline as it is still really blurry. (By the way I was 17 and in Texas that's considered an adult for legal matters so I was in adult county jail not jeuvinile) I was kicked out of school and sent to an alternative lockdown school. I was so miserable at this point, I had basically no social interaction because the alternative school has very strict rules and you are basically not even allowed to talk to each other. My best friend at the time stopped hanging out with me, I couldn't hang out with my other drug buddies because of my parents. It was getting hard to leave the house because my mom would call the cops and file me as a runaway if she thought I was doing ANYTHING sketchy. My self consciousness was out of control and I just didn't give a shit about anything anymore. n     I ended up convincing my old co-worker from the theater to buy me 500 Xanax bars off the internet black market site silk roads so we could try to make some money. When it finally came in and I started selling some, I was barred the fuck out constantly. The pills kept me from hating myself temporarily and I would have long blackout periods and one day my parents walked in on me counting some out. Obviously they flipped, I was so fucked up I could barely stand but I was trying to leave and my dad was holding me back. I only remember bits and pieces but I swung at him and he tried to hold me down. Next thing I know I'm in handcuffs and off to jail again. My parents were done with me so we made a deal that I'd go to rehab if they bailed me out. n     In rehab I was finally forced to deal with my issues sober. I was with a group of guys all around my age (16-18) and as you would expect with a bunch of drug addict teenagers the new guy isn't very welcomed. I would hear them talking shit about me and looking over towards me and laughing. As you guys her know, with social anxiety this is a living nightmare. I couldn't get away from it either because the facility was essentially lockdown style. Very strict schedule everyday and you were always watched and taken places together with your group by the employees. I won't go into too much detail about the rehab experience because there's too much to cover. I was there for a total of 87 days. Long story short, I eventually became friends with my group and had alot of counseling which helped me with a lot of my anxiety and depression. n     When I got out I was sent to a sober house to start my adult life. I turned 18 a few days after rehab. A sober house is basically a house specifically for drug addicts to help readjust them back to the real world after either jail time or rehab. It's really just like having a shit ton of roommates and you just have a few requirements to meet every week such as attending AA or NA meetings, house chores, and you have to get a job and keep it. This is where things actually went well for me. Most of the guys who lived there were around 25 years old and since I was the youngest they kind of took me under their wing. I was like a little brother almost. It took awhile but I finally came out of my shell and i got some relief from my depression and anxiety. I still rarely went out of my comfort zone, I didn't really make any friends outside the ones who lived with me but I really didn't care. I finally felt somewhat normal! After a few months of working fast food I got a job waiting tables. It was really good money and although it's almost all social interaction I forced myself through it. I was still very awkward and pretty self conscious but I was able to maintain. Life went on pretty regularly with not many changes for about a year. I finally had a little extra money and felt confident to live on my own without the structure of the sober home. I got an apartment with one of the guys who lived there and all seemed well. n     This is where things started slowly declining. I did well for a few months but then I stopped attending AA and NA meetings and stopped hanging out with my friends from the house as much. I was just working and playing video games. I started dating a girl from work and it started off great. However one day I started drinking and smoking weed again and things went downhill. My anxiety and depression returned with a vengeance. I was convinced people at work were talking shit about me and making fun of me and my behavior started going back to my old ways. I was very nervous all the time and my social anxiety was getting really bad again. I was barely going out anymore and became very paranoid. I blew up multiple times at work from stress, yelling at people who I thought were talking shit or just getting too overwhelmed during the rushes. I cheated on my gf and she broke up with me and I was devastated. I knew I was a fucking asshole but I just become a different person when I'm using drugs or drinking a lot. I got back into pills and could barely pay my bills. Me and my girlfriend got back together and I felt a little better but the anxiety was still getting worse. n     My depression really took over and I was fatigued all the time. I could barely make it through a short shift and when I got home I would immediately lay on my bed and sleep for hours during the day. My paranoia was fucking with my head so badly at work that I could barely focus. I don't know how to explain it, but when I get like that it feels like everything is happening right up in my face.

Those who are ‘meant’ to read this &amp; offer guidance, will. I hope :) nnNo idea how to cut it down into a TLDR as it is far too lengthy.nnI'll try to keep this first backstory as short &amp; to the point as possible. I'm 21, live in Australia on the east coast, grew up in Sydney and lived there until I was 18. I have a sister who is 7 years older who still lives in our hometown. Lost my father at a young age at 13. I've been battling depression for over 5 years since I was 15. I moved 2 hours away from my hometown at 18 &amp; my depression got much worse. I stopped seeing friends, stopped going out, stopped talking to my friends/family which led to dealing with anxiety issues which led to social anxiety due to isolating myself. (Among other symptoms)nnI've recently started seeing a psychologist, getting out of the house more, I'm finally starting to feel like going out &amp; doing things. I want to meet people. I've been out more/done more in January of this year than I have the past 2 years. Finally starting to feel 'normal'. I still haven't reconnected with any of my old friends. I haven't posted anything on my personal social media accounts (Facebook/Instagram/Snapchat) since I first moved in late 2014. Haven't spoken to any friends since then &amp; haven't seen them either. Some have reached out to me but I never replied. Haven’t had a job since I moved up here either. nnFor some reason I'm still afraid to reach out to them because I know that will lead to eventually meeting up with them in person. I'm even afraid to post anything on social media from fear of them reaching out to me. Because I know this will lead down the same route. I haven't made any new friends since moving from my hometown, haven't worked or studied &amp; basically feel like a complete failure. Afraid of what they will say, think or feel about me cos I have no life per say.nnI have already made a post looking for advice/guidance regarding the issue related to my old friends, however the above context was necessary to lead onto my next story which I am solely looking for advice/guidance for.nn~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~nnNew years eve I went to a house party with my older Sister cos I had nothing else to do, literally, and met all her friends etc. People were drinking, majority of people were on drugs, MDMA, LSD &amp; Ketamine was available. I hadn’t had drugs for 3 years since Australia day in 2014 when I was 18. I didn’t plan on taking anything. I met a girl who lived there, friend of my sisters who’s my age - lets call her Mary. I was told by a few people she thought I was attractive &amp; wanted to hookup. I haven’t hooked up with anyone for over 2 years and I actually was thinking that about her anyway so I was keen.nnI was drinking a lot when I first got there because of my anxiety, meeting new people etc. and ended up having to stop drinking because I was getting sick mixing it with weed. (Only drank 4 times last year so I had a very low tolerance). A few hours later I was in Marys room with her, my sister &amp; another girl who lived there just talking; lets call her Barbara. Barbara asked if we all wanted to get any more MDMA caps (her bf had stuff people could buy during the night). All of them had already taken an MDMA cap each earlier on in the night &amp; they all said yeah to having another one, which left me to decide; I ended up asking for one since I felt comfortable, didn’t feel pressured by them and the moment felt right to do it (granted my judgement was way off cause I was drinking/smoking; not the best idea to jump on drugs with people you barely know, but I felt safe being with my sister). So I took mine with them &amp; they left me and Mary in the room not long after.nnStarted talking to Mary, getting to know her and all that. Basically having a d&amp;m. She was telling me that she is going overseas this year to a US summer camp for 6 weeks. I felt so unaccomplished &amp; like a loser basically because there’s no way I could do that. I told her she’s really ambitious &amp; we started talking about other things while smoking weed together. We ended up hooking up for awhile, kissed at midnight &amp; started talking more after that.nnAt one point while we were outside having a cigarette, she asked me to tell her ‘my life story’, it caught me off guard cos if I’m honest I don’t even know what it is. I got about halfway through &amp; somehow we got interrupted and I never got to hear hers or finish mine. I realised I was saying a lot of bad things that had happened in my life, rather than who I am and what I do? nnAnyway, Mary &amp; Barbara decided to come back with me, my sister &amp; her partner back to their place about an hour or two after Midnight to spend the rest of the night together. They were all going to take a tab of LSD each when we got back, I didn’t want to have psychedelics so I had a second MDMA cap. nnWhen we got back to my sisters place , Mary &amp; Barbara lost an acid tab when we got there. Eventually we all gave up looking for it &amp; they all took a tab each. Not long after taking the tab it got kinda weird with her, her vibe changed &amp; she wasn’t talking much, we weren’t as ‘close’ physically as earlier (not cuddling n stuff) but we were holding hands? They were all waiting for the LSD to kick in &amp; everyone wasn’t really talking much, and cos I hadn’t taken a tab I wasn’t on the same ‘level’.nnI think that’s where things changed cos my 2nd MDMA cap was coming on while her tab was coming on so we were on different wavelengths. We were all chilling in the lounge room laying down for about an hour and it was pretty obvious Barbara was the 5th wheel. Mary, her friend &amp; my sister went into her room and were talking for awhile. Eventually they came out and we all went for a cigarette on the balcony and they basically came and said they were leaving. They were going to stay the night then an hour or two later after we got back they said they were leaving cos her friend wanted to be with her boyfriend. I was too out of it to leave the unit &amp; when I said ‘I’m too f*cked to leave when Mary asked me if I was coming she said 'well your ambitious’. Never has my gut dropped so much. Instant regret. Such a horrible feeling, intensified by the drugs. I’m sure they left cos they started feeling uncomfortable being there, particularly Marys friend being the 5th wheel without her BF on new years eve.nnMy sister, her partner &amp; I all planned on coming back to their placed to end the night there regardless, a safe place to come back to. So we kind of all had it in our head that we weren’t leaving after we got back. Looking back I wish I went back with Mary &amp; her friend but it probably wasn’t the best idea because they ended up taking another tab and ‘day-tripped’. Which could have ended up quite messy since it was pretty messy after they left anyway just being with my sister n her partner. Who knows what would happened - I never will know cos I chose not to go.nnI told my sister n her partner the next morning what Mary said when she left &amp; I asked them if I screwed up by not going back with her - my sisters husband said yeah i thought I heard her say something like that but my sister sort of dismissed it. They were both pretty adamant that I hadn’t ‘fucked up’ though - the next day my sister said she spoke to Mary on FB and asked her about what she said before she left that night &amp;  she said that she didn't say that at all, something like 'oh alright then' was what she apparently said but I didn't really believe it.nnMary sent me a message first on snapchat a couple days after new years basically saying ‘hey was nice to meet you had a nice time &amp; we said we should chill n have a sesh sometime’ etc. So we started talking a little bit, went to buy weed from their place a day later &amp; added her on FB but didn’t ask for her number. Such an idiot. Anyway, It was my sisters birthday the first week of 2017 &amp; she had a party the first weekend (7th Jan - Saturday), Mary &amp; I were both going so we were going to catch up there.nnI was talking to her leading up to my sisters bday party after i came home on the Thursday and then the next night I had a panic attack after smoking some weed (happened cos of repressed emotions from traumatic domestic event in late 2016) &amp; went to the doctor the next morning for a referral to a psychologist along with some sort of temporary medication to help me sleep &amp; I haven't spoken to her since. And with all my anxiety i'm afraid to even talk to her because its been over a month and she probably thinks I’m a rude douchebag but then again she may not even think twice about it. My sister said she knows I have a lot going on in my life at the moment so she probably doesn’t mind.nnI felt like I got attached to her way too quickly after that night, or perhaps attached to the idea of potentially being with someone? Since it had been so long since I’ve actually had that physical connection with someone it was quite difficult to just ‘let go’ and forget about it. I became afraid of this attachment and decided to stop talking to her to detach myself, I didn’t want to come across as needy or obsessive. Couldn’t stop thinking about her for 2 weeks afterwards. Avoiding talking to her ended up making me think of her more. She hasn’t messaged me since I didn’t reply to her last message so as far as she’s concerned she may not even think about me at all?nnWhen I was younger I used to talk to girls day &amp; night (not exactly proud of it) but my point is I had confidence, I wasn't anxious or insecure - like I’m too afraid to even message Mary? I just feel awkward after hooking up with her, when I went to her place &amp; added her on FB I was so awkward around her, didn’t know how to act around her after hooking up &amp; being so f*cked from the drugs lol - I just want to be able to talk to her and get to know her, &amp; i don’t really feel like getting to know her through text is how I want to do it either, I’d rather do it in person. But then I’m awkward in person after hooking up lol, don’t how to be. nnDon’t know what to do, she keeps popping in my head. Feel like I’m not worthy enough, not enough self worth &amp; confidence. No job, no car, no license, no friends, what do I have to offer? I lift weights, I’m fit, I’m healthy, I’m intelligent, I’m educated, own my own business, I feel like I’m attractive - definitely not ugly, but can barely bring myself to message her on Facebook. nnAm I just mentally stuck on this whole thing? Do I need to let it go &amp; move on? I know the next move would be to reach out to her again &amp; eventually ask to meet up in person &amp; go from there. But my social anxiety is stopping me. I feel like there is a lot that has gone unsaid between us that should be spoken about &amp; idk if thats me overthinking it but I don’t even know how to bring that up to her either. I feel so weird thinking all of this when I barely know her. I just don’t know what to do, or how to ask her how she feels about the whole thing cos apparently she got out of a year long relationship herself &amp; according to my sister ‘she probably isn’t looking for anything’. So as far as Mary is concerned it may have just been a one time thing to hook up on New Years; I don’t know her well enough to make that judgement and don’t feel comfortable enough to talk to my sister about it anymore cos I told her about getting attached and she made me feel like a complete idiot for being like that.nnIdk if it was because I was on MDMA (I know it dissolves boundaries &amp; you generally have a better connection with other people, the ‘love drug’, very euphoric) but I was drawn to her in a way I have never experienced before (before taking the MDMA), normally I'm sexually attracted to girls like yeah I find her attractive but that's not what drew me too her - idk how to explain it. Like a deeper connection? I don’t want to say like a soul mate, but I’ve never felt a connection like this with a person before? But then again it could be a superficial connection with the drugs. I really have no idea!nnAny opinions/advice/guidance would seriously be appreciated so much! I have no one to talk to about this. I got about a 1/3 way through the story with my psychologist in todays session &amp; it’s just eating me up inside! I want to get out of this mental rut!nnThank you in advance &lt;3",1

7954,"KloudNIN","post","I'm Receiving Residential Treatment","   A couple weeks ago I flew from Connecticut to Wisconsin to receive residential treatment for my social anxiety. This was something that was absolutely terrifying for me at the beginning, because this meant I had to live with people I didn't know, and wouldn't be able to see my loved ones until I left. I've gotten a bit used to this setting by now, though it still difficult not seeing the people I used to know.nnnI thought that maybe I should try to make a post on this subreddit to talk a little bit about what it's like, in case anyone would be interested. I probably won't be able to cover everything, but I can try to answer any questions in the comments to the best of my abilities.nnnSo where I am, the way we go about treatment is by learning coping skills, having bans, and doing exposures. Bans are the thing, rituals, that you have to try and resist doing. So we have little books where we write down if we resisted that ban, or if we submitted. An example of one of my bans is checking. I feel the urge to constantly check my schedule to make sure i have the right day/time/room number even though I am very confident that I already know it. The same with always having to check the name of a meal that I'm about to order at a restaurant, even though I've ordered that meal plenty of times before. I check because I'm terrified of getting it wrong, but what we're trying to teach ourselves here is that it's okay to be wrong, or okay to not be certain. I mean, many of us know that that's okay, but we don't always just feel that way.nnnnExposures, on the other hand, are actions we want to take, and push ourselves through. Here we rate our anxiety on a scale of 0-7, we never put ourselves through a 7. Our exposures are to stay around 2/3, and once we start getting used to them (and see that we're less anxious by recording our anxiety rating each time), we move onto the next level (which should now be less anxiety provoking because of our previous exposure).nnnnFor example, I've been absolutely terrified to talk on phones, it took me about 2 years before I could attempt to call my boyfriend on the phone. My first exposure for this was to just dial a number, not even call it. This was a little hard for me because I was afraid that I would accidentally hit the call button, and because I feel the need to check and make sure the number was right. The next exposure was to dial a number and let it ring once. This was scary because a couple times someone did actually pick up, and i guess the dial tone and ringing just made my heart race. The one I'm working on now is to call a business and when they pick up, tell them that I have the wrong number. So the conversation won't last, but I still have to say something. My next one will be to call a business and ask one question, but I'm still a little nervous on the last one so I don't know when I'll be moving onto it yet.nnnWe do each exposure 5 times a day, and I usually have at least 5 different exposures to do. Some of them I can't always accomplish that many times because they're situational, such arriving to group late and not apologizing for it.nnnnBesides our bans and exposures, we have therapy groups, experimental therapy groups, and art therapy. The first one is more talking in a group and coming up with solutions with certain situations or feelings, the ET is more about working as a group and figure out puzzles or games, and the last one is just art where so far, we're able to do whatever we want for it.nnnI haven't really talked much about the living situation, but I have to go to our check-in group in a minute (check-in in the morning is where we talk about our bans and exposures from the day before). But if anyone is interested I'll try to add it on later.nnnThanks for reading!",1

I apologize for bad formatting and the length, but thank you to all those who read this fully.nnI'm sitting in my bed now and I can't sleep. I joined this subreddit a few days ago and I just needed to vent. I'm a 19 year old guy in college with social anxiety. My anxiety became apparent to me at a young age and was dismissed by others until my senior year of high school. I was the Salutatorian, but I chose not to give a speech because the crippling anxiety I felt just thinking about it. Graduation itself was hard enough. My doctor warned about dependency on medicine so I opted out and tried to work on my anxiety without medication.nnFast forward to college and I'm in a philosophy course on ethics. My professor requires discussion, so every 3 weeks we are required to ask a question about the topics being discussed. The days went by and everyone began asking their questions. I wrote down so many questions, but I couldn't raise my hand and speak. Not asking a question results in an 8 percent deduction from the overall grade. It was supposed to be easy points.nnHowever, the final day to ask a question arrives and I sat down. I could already feel the pressure and my mind raced and felt cloudy. As class started and continued I wrote down potential questions. I even limited the words in each question so I could quickly stammer it out. I couldn't do it, and my grades are very important to me. 10 minutes were left and I was sweating. I couldn't think. I was overheating and my face was red. I felt like everyone was looking at me. My throat felt tight and I felt like I couldn't breathe.nnThe class finally ended and I just sat there. Everyone began leaving and I awkwardly made my way to the professor and explained that I had so many questions but I couldn't raise my hand and ask one. He took pity and gave me credit but he said next time I must ask a question to the class.nI couldn't shake the unease I felt in class; I felt a cloud over my head all day. Once I returned to my dorm I broke down. I couldn't control the tears. I felt worthless. I felt depressed. I couldn't do something as simple as raising my hand and asking a single question.nnLater that day I received a call from my mother. We had met with a psychiatrist two weeks prior because I couldn't concentrate in class.nThe psychiatrist ruled out ADD, and asked my mom if she had noticed signs of anxiety and depression because the test results pointed heavily in that direction. I had never thought that I was depressed until I started to reflect. I try to act happy on the outside but I have been so unhappy for so long. My anxiety has controlled so much of my life.nSo now I'll be meeting with my doctor again and I'm willing to give medication a try. I don't know how it works but my psychiatrist said that she sent the results to my doctor and I should be receiving some form of anxiety medication and antidepressants.nnI told my mom that I wanted to start therapy for both my anxiety and depression. I want control of my life back. I NEED control of my life back. This last week has been rough since the anxiety attack. I've been avoiding class and social situations, and instead just staying in my dorm with my roommate (who is ironically a communications major).nnThank you to anyone who reads this. I just needed to this out so I can hopefully start moving forward. I am hopeful for the future with therapy and medication. I hope everyone else here makes amazing strides with their anxiety issues. Goodnight.",1

7989,"ParanoidAndroid001","post","The 3 Best Ways to Overcome Social Anxiety","I have suffered with social anxiety for about 25 years, with symptoms starting at about age 10. In addition, I started developing extreme redness and flushing of the face, sweating and nervous tics. In later years OCD thought patterns and behaviour, substance abuse and addiction issues started to appear. These all peaked between the ages of 18 and 28.nnnThis issue has taken me to the depths of despair, made me believe I was losing my mind and led me to contemplate suicide on multiple occasions. Now, at age 35, I have largely, thankfully, been able to overcome these issues and am happier than I ever imagined possible.nnnHere I would like to share the three most effective ways I have found of dealing with social anxiety.nnn1. Working out/physical exercise - The first and most crucial step for me was to create a regular exercise regime. This is extremely helpful in combating social anxiety in a number of ways.nnnFirstly, and most importantly for me, it laid the foundation for a new self image. As my physique developed, so did my confidence. I no longer saw myself as a “skinny loser”. As Tim Ferriss says, “Inner game is outer game and outer game is inner game”, meaning your mind will affect your body and your physical reality, but your body and physical reality equally affects your mind. For the first time in my life I started to actually like the way I looked and I saw other people noticing it too. I got compliments and people even began to ask me for exercise advice.nnnOn a neurobiological level, regular exercise also releases endorphins, testosterone and dopamine. These powerful hormones and neurotransmitters change your brain chemistry and positively alter your mood. Exercise also lowers stress hormones such as cortisol, which reduces anxiety and further increases your feeling of wellbeing.nnnAs a sufferer of social anxiety, I often felt I was going crazy because of the speed of my thoughts and the level of negative chatter in my head. I found that exercise made me exhausted, so I didn’t have the energy reserves to entertain this kind of restless mental chatter. This also meant that I slept far better in the evenings and awoke rested and in a better frame of mind. Again, good sleep is crucial for regulating our hormones, brain chemistry and mood.nnnAnother important point, is that exercise is a “keystone” habit. This means that once this habit is created, it usually has a lot of other positive, “ripple out” effects. As mentioned above, my sleep was improved by regular exercise, but so were many other areas of my life. Having invested time in the gym, I didn’t want to “undo” my good work by eating junk. I started to eat far better and became interested in nutrition. I began to pay close attention to how much water I drank and made sure I was well hydrated. I also quit smoking and taking drugs, and drastically reduced my alcohol intake, as these were no longer congruent with my new developing self image. As well as increasing my sense of control over myself and my life, all of these things also had a very positive effect on me at a chemical level and helped improve my brain function and mood.nnn2. Therapy (including CBT and exposure therapy)nnnI have been in therapy on and off since the age of 20 and I’m not ashamed to say that. I found it such a mind-blowing and enlightening process that I am now training to be a psychotherapist myself.nnnTherapy helped me to understand the complexity of the issue of social anxiety and see it as a symptom of a deeper war and conflict being waged against the self. Why do we interpret being looked at as such a negative and unpleasant experience? Why are we unable to accept ourselves - how we look, how we talk, how we ARE?nnnSome people revel in the attention of others, whereas for us sufferers of social anxiety it is an excruciating ordeal. We often feel ashamed of and loathe ourselves. Therapy helped me to unpick this complex nexus of ideas and make me realise that SA was just one facet or symptom of a bigger, more complex issue.nnnOther symptoms and related issues included:nnn- OCDnn- chronically low self esteemnn- self sabotagenn- depressionnn- substance abusenn- under achievementnn- extreme flushing and rednessnn- extreme sweatingnn- psychosomatic illnessnn- self consciousnessnn- addictions (to porn, food and computer screens)nnnAll of this made me see SA as a symptom rather than an “illness” in itself. The deeper, underlying issue was my relationship with myself - my lack of self love and self esteem.nnnAs I said above, I started to gain more respect and appreciation for myself through working out - I respected my willpower and discipline to get in shape and began to like my physical appearance. But deeper work had to be done using CBT techniques and talking therapy to challenge my old negative belief patterns about myself.nnnI learned to focus on areas of myself that I liked or that were positive, no matter how small - the arch of my eyebrow, the shape of my forearms, my sense of humour. I started to dissect and question blanket statements I had previously made about myself - “I’m a f*cking loser”...nn“Really? There must be some area where you’ve had a victory or success, no matter how small”...nnnI learned to be more critical and nuanced in my thinking.nnnI also found exposure exercises a very helpful part of my therapy. I have been to several therapists over the decades I have been battling SA - some very good, many very poor. But it was with one of the worst therapists that I did the best work.nnnI was at a particularly low ebb and told the therapist I was unable to even walk into a supermarket and was even uncomfortable walking in public - I didn’t know how I should let my arms swing and couldn’t do anything naturally as I felt scrutinised everywhere I went.nnnHis response was to expose me to these fears and take me on two of the most surreal, but helpful therapy sessions of my life. In one session I walked around town, while he followed and observed from a distance, occasionally shouting advice like a sports coach on the touchline - “keep your head up … meet their gaze ...don’t stoop!”.nnnIt was bizarre, hilarious and liberating. I couldn’t believe how few f*cks this guy gave.nnnIn another session, in order to tackle of my phobia of the supermarket, we went to the local Tesco and just stood opposite each other in the toothpaste aisle. Just standing and looking ahead, not talking to one another. People came and went and rather than my head imploding or the sky falling down no one batted an eyelid at us. Finally, an old lady came down the aisle and just start chatting away merrily to me. I chatted with her a while and she left. I looked across the aisle at the therapist and he said with a serene, Zen monk-like smile, “It’s amazing what happens when you are just standing around isn’t it?”.nnnAnd he was right, it was amazing.nnnExposure therapy forces you to face your fears and demons head on. It allows you to stick a pin in them and discover they are just phantoms of your mind filled with nothing but hot air.nnnAs SA sufferers we are held hostage by our preoccupation with what other people think of us. Through exercises such as those above you learn firsthand that no one gives a f*ck about what you are doing! They have far too much going on in their own heads with their own insecurities about their appearance, the argument they just had with their spouse, and the credit card payment they just missed.nnn3. Developing success habitsnnnAs I mentioned above, a regular exercise routine helped me develop good health habits such as good sleep hygiene, eating right and being well hydrated. But it also spurred me on to develop a lot of success habits. I did an audit of bad habits I had that were frustrating me and started to address them.nnnSome of the positive habits that I started to develop included:nnn- Finishing things that I startednn- Taking care of things before they piled up and got out of control - washing up, tax returns, clothes washing etc.nn- Not leaving things to the last minutenn- Not procrastinatingnn- Daily meditationnn- Planning my day the night beforenn- Generally becoming more organizednn- Cutting out Facebook and other distractions to improve focus and productivitynn- Cutting out internet pornnnnThese all gave me a much better outlook on life. I had my sh*t together and felt powerful, determined and proactive, whereas before I had felt weak and passive.nnnThere is a tendency among us SA sufferers to underachieve and end up in poorly paid jobs that we take because they are an “easy option” - it was the first interview we took and we were too nervous to go through the whole process again, it’s a night shift in a warehouse where we don’t have to see many people, it’s a work-from-home job where we don’t have to interact with other people at all etc.nnnBut with this newfound sense of determination and drive I decided I wanted to break out of my low-level job, where I was underachieving, undervalued and underpaid.  I started my own online business and was soon able to quit my job where I felt depressed, was treated like a subordinate and taken advantage of.nnnBecause of this success, built on these positive habits, my self esteem rose. I had more confidence in myself and my abilities. And with more money in the bank, I was able to move out of my parents house, buy my own house and car and was not some “loser”, who was dependent on his parents or anyone else. I was more financially stable and because of this I felt far more emotionally stable.nnnI found that tackling my physical circumstances of job, salary, and living at home with my parents all played a part in reducing SA. It’s hard to feel like a strong, worthy, confident person if you are living with your parents, broke, and dependent. For me, my physical circumstances fed into my internal world. On a chemical level, being in a subordinate position in the workplace and at home, having money worries and having work which depresses you all decrease “feel-good” hormones and neurotransmitters, increase stress hormones and thus increase anxiety generally.nnnI’m not suggesting everyone should, or wants to, start their own business or quit their job, but I do believe creating success habits gives you far more control over your life and gives you a sense of greater self efficacy, power and confidence. It may also allow you to improve your physical situation, which could lead to a better income, greater financial stability, more independence, improved self confidence and less anxiety generally.nnnWhatever your situation, building success habits builds a more ordered internal and external world and helps develop many of the characteristics that are needed to overcome SA.nnnnnIn conclusion, in order to overcome SA we need to take a holistic approach. There is no magic Ayurvedic herb or “silver bullet” that is going to cure this problem overnight for us. It is a journey we undertake to transform ourselves from anxious, passive people who are governed by concerns about others’ opinions of us and negative evaluations of ourselves, into strong, proactive individuals who have love and appreciation for ourselves and who become less concerned about what others might say or think of us.nnnThe inner game of self esteem, self efficacy, willpower and discipline can all be cultivated by working on your outer game with a regular exercise regime - whether that be in the gym or by working out at home, with whatever type of exercise you want to do and wherever you want to do it. Negative self talk, limiting belief patterns can also be challenged and effectively exploded through talking therapy, CBT and exposure therapy exercises. And by developing success habits we can feel more in control of our lives and self, which may also have positive spin-off effects in the professional and financial realm.nnnThrough 25 years of dealing with this issue, one of the main things I’ve learned is that SA is a kind of self-made mental prison. It appears so real when we are in it, but when we push the walls, we find they fall away like flimsy cardboard stage props. People are mainly self-absorbed, they don’t give a flying f*ck about what you are doing, how you walk or how you talk.nnnIt’s your world and other people just happen to be in it, so live accordingly!nnn",1

I'm very unsatisfied with my social life.nI've even been in therapy before (no medication, just behavorial stuff), but my therapist said he doesn't think I have a severe case of social anxiety. nI don't care if I have a ""severe case of social anxiety"" or not - being afraid of other people's judgement has been what's holding me back since forever.nnSorry this is a wall of text but getting it off my chest really helped just now:nnI would describe myself as an extroverted and outgoing person. At least when I'm with people I'm familiar with. I also have no troubles holding presentations; during my teens I've been into acting and I didn't even have a problem with acting a play in front of a crowd of several hundred people.nnBut no matter where I am, I feel like I'm trapped inside a bubble. I've been having nightmares about this, too. I feel confined to my 1-room apartment (even though I leave it all the time for uni/ work/ meetin w friends).nnDoesn't sound like I was having a problem, right? I can function around other people and people might even perceive me as self confident. But in fact, I'm always building a wall, I'm always second guessing everything I do. And I get panic attacks where I start sweating, my eyes get wet and I feel dizzy. And I get panic attacks with the most normal stuff: going to the barber shop, going to the supermarket. Whatever. Any location that has lots of people around.nnLast night I was at this club. I went with a friend and we split up soon after entering. I had one of my panic attacks and had to leave like half an hour later. Didn't talk to anyone. I knew this would happen, but I've always kept thinking ""hey, if I push myself it'll eventually get better"". But it doesn't get better. I feel like I'll never be able to enjoy myself around other people. Even the smallest things like grocery shopping are a huge stressful task for me. And it happens all the time that I get into (mostly minor) problems because of this. Running out of food bc I couldn't bring up the energy to go to the super market is the most common example. And I'm so damn ashamed about this, too. I mean, who runs out of food because he was too afraid to do grocery shopping yesterday??nnI'm also incapable of meeting new people because of this. And this is the most horrible thing. I've been on like 3 dates in my entire life (I'm 24) simply because I'm not meeting enough girls I'm interested in. If I should happen to have a female acquaintance I'm attracted to, it wouldn't even be that big of a deal for me to ask her out. But this first step from turning a stranger into an acquaintance is something I'm not capable of. Not capable of, at all. Regardless of gender, age or whatever.nnRight now, I'm about to graduate from uni. And I'm alone all the time. Before, I had classes where I occasionally met new people. Now I don't. I'm too socially anxious to keep clinging to the people I hung out with last semester because everyone of them too is dealing with their own life right now and they don't seem to be interested in hanging out in this constellation again. I would've loved to make friends at this club last night, but I'm obviously too anxious to do that.nThing is, I don't really understand what to do about my situation. I'm 24 already and really not socially inept. But these panic attacks are what's holding me back. And I simply don't know what I need to work on so my situation gets better.nRight now, I've been contemplating about pushing myself to go buy a beer and just sit on a park bench. I could do that, if I really wanted, I guess. It would be super exhausting, however. And the thing is, I would still not meet others just by sitting on a bench on a sunny afternoon.nnOther people always seem so casual about making new acquaintances. I'm so envious. I feel my life is horrible. I've had a lot of depressive episodes. And honestly, I feel my incapability of making new friends and connecting with other people is what makes my whole life a horrible experience.",1

I've never talked to anyone about my problems, and for some reason I'm terrified to do so. What do I even say to my doctor? Should I just straight up say I think I might have social anxiety?

8015,"LiveOrDie5050","post","How I CURED my Social Anxiety","Hi guys so I'll try and keep this as short and to the point as I can but I wanted to share how I finally cured my Social Anxiety. This won't work for everyone but for some of you it might depending on what your actual problem is. So first of all you need to understand why you have Social Anxiety in the first place. What is it about social situations that terrify you so much? Why do we have anxiety in this situation yet other people don't? You really need to understand why you suffer from this condition because when you understand why then you are able to fix it. I struggled knowing why for years - which prevented me from fixing it. I thought I had something wrong with me or some sort of mental/personality disorder. I tried CBT and went on medication to help me be more confident but it didn't work. And the reason it didn't work was because it didn't get to the ultimate cause of why I had social anxiety. So recently I sat down and asked myself ""Why? Why do I have social anxiety? What is it that I'm so afraid of?"" and finally I came up with the answer.nnWhat I realised was that I could look like anyone else and be the best looking person in the world with thousands and thousands of friends and I would still have social anxiety. I could even be the most confident person in the world and still suffer with this condition. I realised the reason why I had social anxiety was because of this, Gelotophobia.nnFor those who don't know, Gelotophobia is an intense fear of being mocked/laughed at by others. It explained everything. I was constantly worrying and obsessive over my look - not because I was vein but because I was terrified that if I didn't look perfect I would be mocked over how I look. It wasn't other people that scared me, it wasn't making conversations with strangers, it was an intense fear of being mocked/laughed at over anything I said or did. After speaking to strangers or friends I would replay the encounters in my head, terrified of any slight mistakes I might have made and that these people would be mocking me over them. I could remember suffering from this as young as 7 years old because I remember presenting in front of the class and some kid was whispering to other kids while I was presenting. I remember even then being paranoid that he was whispering about me and mocking me.nnThe point is though is that it didn't matter how confident I could become or how many friends I could have or how good looking I could be - I would still suffer with social anxiety because Gelotophobia was what was causing me to have it. An intense irrational fear of being mocked. Anyway once I learnt I had this I went and got treatment by speaking to my doctor. Seen as it is a phobia, the cure is effectively no different than someone looking to cure a phobia of flying, driving, etc. Phobias can be cured pretty easily. Talking therapy works well as does hypnotherapy, hypnosis, group therapy etc. Even recognising why I felt so paranoid in social situations helped me. I realised I was just scared that people might mock me - but now I knew I had this phobia I realised it was completely irrational.nnSo the bottom line is try and work out why you really have social anxiety. I realise that maybe even most of you may not suffer from Gelotophobia and could have social anxiety because of other reasons. But if others can recognise the symptoms like I did then maybe I can help some of you cure this horrible condition. Thanks.",1
8016,"Pizzaman4954","post","Do I even have social anxiety? Do you need to have friends?","Long story short, I've been depressed before. I started seeing a therapist who I told my story to. That I have social anxiety, that I hate myself, that all I could think about is how useless I am, nothing is fun etc etc.nnSo she told me to try quit smoking weed (which I did every day), and cutting down on my gaming (which I did basically all day besides working) for a month. And I did.nnAfter this I started to feel a lot better, since a big part of my depression (feels obvious in retrospect) was that weed made me very anxious, especially when I was smoking with friends. ESPECIALLY with not super close friends.nnVoila, I started to study some on my free time and started reading books and what not instead of gaming and I also had a lot time to think. My depression/self loathing went away pretty quick.nnn**To the point of the post:**nMy therapist called it pretty early, that she doesn't think I have social anxiety, since I don't really *want* to hang out with people and socialize or whatever. I'm fine being on my own, doing my own thing. I don't get bored, I can be productive, I love to improve (now just irl instead of in Dota 2).nnI've always been surrounded by friends (I have 2 of them, and I see them A LOT, super extroverted people who's calling me / meeting me like 3-4 times a week). These are the only 2 friends I've ever had, and I feel like we are drifting apart because of my new realization.nnBasically all my life I never once initiated any plans with another person. I just go along with stuff I always get invited to. Honestly I'd prefer to just be alone every time but I say yes because I wanna be nice to them. Not that I hate being with them, but I don't find it exciting at all either. (Hard to formulate but you maybe get the idea.)nnThe reason we became so good friends is basically because of the video games we played together during all years. Not all we have in common, but definitely the biggest factor. Now all of us grew up, (I've known them since I was 8, we're 21 now), we don't play the same video games anymore. They are interested in football, girls and partying which they do with other people. I'm always invited but I don't enjoy it at all if their other friends are with us. I feel really alienated with the ""other friends"". Not that they are mean or anything, I just have nothing to say to them and I just sit quiet all evening. Or make super awkward conversation (this is what caused my social anxiety theory).nnAnyway, I don't know if I'm capable of being all alone in the long run. What if they stop calling me? Will I be able to feel good on my own for 1 month? 1 year? 10 years? Then what, I might get lonely and just live a miserable life. Because I'm a awkward/uninteresting fuck who has no idea how to make a friend. All hypothetical of course, but man it's really hard to think about. nnBasically just a rant but if anyone have any advice to me or are in the same shoes please hit me up :(nnPS: Writing this made me realize I should maybe try to see new friends but I have no idea how. Even if I would try I'm... Ugh... I guess I'm too afraid to make it too uncomfortable since I'm so awkward, and also I don't feel like I need to since I like being alone so FUCK I don't even know where I'm going with this... nn",1

I am in my second year of B.Sc Computer Science. Currently I am working on a long term (16 month) industry internship away from university. Simultaneously, I am also part of a potentially groundbreaking startup in bioinformatics. I have always been exceptionally smart and motivated, when it comes to tech and studies. However, I have never really had friends as such. I'd say, my professors are the closest to company that I've ever had in my life. I have exactly 5 phone numbers on my phone- my mom, dad, and 3 professors.nPeople my age are into clubbing, concerts, bars, etc. I, on the other hand am into research, studying, learning about and dismantling hardware. I have constantly tried to force myself into social situations but even then I end up standing alone, in the corner of the room thinking about the next Graphics card launch or something. The reason why I get along with profs so well is because they are also incredibly passionate about their respective fields. I've gone to brunches, symposiums etc with my profs. The prof who is the founder of our startup is literally identical to me (he is not a tech person but he loves to talk about his subject- immunology). He hates holidays, I hate holidays. He dedicates himself to his work and sleeps 4 hrs a day, I do the same.nnIt's just that I can't make small talk. I space out when someone starts talking about themselves. If they are talking about homework or something related to Science, I thoroughly enjoy it.nI've been told that when I talk to people I come off as if I am trying to impress a potential employer. If you ask me ""what's up?"", I'd talk about how I got 10 more internship offers, the new programming languages I learned and how I kicked some graduate students' asses in some competition, or why I dislike Intel's new line of CPUs.nI am incredibly anxious and terrified by social situations EXCEPT- academic events, interviews, anything related to science, career or tech. I completely ace those things. If someone invites me for a social gathering, I'll stand at the corner of the room, think about how I am wasting time there and leave early.n99% of conversations initiated by me with people:nMe:""hey how's it going? What have you been up to lately?""nThem:""I am good. I am doing..... (this is the part I completely ignore)""nMe:""Good to hear, gotta go, bye""nnMy parents were always kind of overprotective when I was a kid. I wasn't allowed to get out of the house without adult supervision all the way till I came to college 2 years ago. Whenever I'd tell my parents that I want to learn a sport, they'd tell me that they are busy with their jobs and they would buy me a new XBOX game instead. Now that I think of it, they made me the materialistic person I am today. I was told that if I study hard, they'd buy me a better computer or console and if I continue working like this, some day I'd earn six figures, buy my own fancy car, expensive gadgets and a mansion. Well guess what? Despite having finished only my second year of uni, I've more than earned back my tuition, own a fancy computer worth more than parents' cars combined and am thinking of getting a German convertible. But am I happy? At that exact second when I buy that fancy item that I've ever dream't of, I am. But the next moment I am back to being the depressed lonely person with no hobbies other than helping people with their homework and fixing their printers. Will I trade my brains and skill for being a normal person? In a heartbeat, without thinking twice.nnI had been attending counselling and my psychologist is perhaps the only person I can vent out to. She is fairly certain that I have ADHD and wants me to get the official diagnosis, so I could get proper treatment but my family think the mental health is a scam. It doesn't help that my uncle who is an exec at a Big Pharma company thinks the same and validates their skepticism of psychiatry and psychology. (The fact that these RELIGIOUS people think a researched science is fake enrages my inner atheist). In fact, when I started taking prescribed anti depressants (no addiction- just started taking it), I had an intervention where they made me throw away my meds.nSomething that was pointed out to me, was that my severe hyperhidrosis might be the reason I never had friends. I hate perfumes, but I shower twice a day, use really strong antiperspirants that burn my skin but nothing works. I can smell 24/7. I am not sure if I want to get surgery but this is one thing both my parents and therapist agree on. Apparently the only complaint against me at my previous job was that I smelled.nnAnyway, sorry for going off topic. To conclude- my interests are way to specific and different from people my age, I sweat too much, I might have ADHD, I don't have friends and I have always tried to make up for my lack of companionship through over-achievement in academics. Suggestions? Is it possible for me to be normal and take interest in mainstream activities?",1

8067,"lizardsoldier","post","I was making such progress, but I think I may have made a huge mistake that'll set me back","**tl;dr** I asked a girl out on a date for the second time ever. She initially said yes, but has been sending disinterested vibes ever since. I'm starting to get the picture - her yes was a ""no"" in disguise. I'm scared that this situation is going to cause my anxiety to get bad again after making such great strides recently.nn---nnI'm a 25 year-old man. I have diagnosed social anxiety disorder. Here are some of my specific triggers that probably sound quite familiar to many of you:nn* Going to the gymn* Asking someone on a daten* Someone doing something illegal around men* Being dressed improperly for the contextn* Unfamiliar social situationsnnI've been making some good progress recently on most of the above. I haven't been going to the gym, but I'm starting to exercise outside of the gym so that I'll be more in shape and feel more like I fit in when I eventually work up the will power to go. I've been asking people who I'm not actually attracted to on dates so that I can get the confidence to ask people who I actually am attracted to. I've been hanging out with a group who have shown me that being improperly dressed isn't the end of the world. It's been good because through exposure I've slowly felt my anxiety symptoms decreasing in intensity.nnRecently I've developed a bit of an attraction to someone who is both a friend and a coworker (full disclosure, I'm demisexual so I'm only ever attracted to people who I'm already close friends with). She seemed interested in me too - encouraging me to take part in her interests while she took interest in mine. That's been great, until she invited me to take part in a yoga class last week (at the gym - not the best!). Not wanting to turn down an opportunity to spend time with someone I'm interested in, I took her up on the invitation despite my feelings of anxiety.nnAnyway, to make a long story short I had a bit of a panic attack in the class. I didn't want to make a huge scene, so when I felt it happening I decided to quietly pack up my things and head on my way even though the class wasn't done. I was hoping to use the momentum of overcoming one anxiety trigger (being at the gym) to overcome another (asking her on a date after the class), but I didn't get to speak to her after the class and we went on our separate ways.nnI asked her this past Friday to have a chat after work, which she agreed to. I used this opportunity to explain to her why I left the yoga class so abruptly, disclosing my diagnosis. She was very supportive in this conversation. I also took the opportunity to ask her on a date because I was tired of feeling attraction without acting on it. I made sure to ask her before I disclosed my anxiety (I didn't want to her accept out of pity - I wanted her to actually want to go). To my surprise and delight, she said yes! It's safe to say that at this point I felt quite proud of myself for overcoming my anxiety.nnBefore I go on, I should also mention what thoughts prevent me from asking girls on dates. The thought is generally a fear that by asking her she'll want to spend less time with me and I'll lose a friend. Remember, I'm only attracted to people who I'm already friends with.nnAnyway, after she said yes I let her enjoy the rest of the night with her friends without bothering her. I wouldn't want to seem too excited too quickly! The next morning I texted her, hoping to set up some specifics. She gently dismissed my suggestions and told me she'd update me with how she was feeling the next day. She didn't.nnSince I shared that I've been attracted to her, the following has happened:nn* She's been communicating with me less (she used to respond to texts in about 5 minutes, but now it takes at least an hour - and she stopped sending me Snapchats altogether)n* There have been excuses about why we can't do the things we did before I asked hern* The two times I've brought up the date, both times she's dismissed my suggestion without offering alternativesnnI've come to believe she's not interested in me. I'm scared that I'm losing a friend (what my negative thoughts told me would happen). I'm scared that I'll have great difficulty getting back to a place where I can ask someone on a date. I'm scared that I'll have difficulty overcoming other parts of my anxiety. This is a scary situation.nnThanks for listening to my issues. ",1

I do a mix of all above it depends on the mood I'm in and how bad my social anxiety is that day too. I take atavin for days I'm feeling not too great.
