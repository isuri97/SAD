For a lot of people there comes a time where it kind of 'clicks,' but that comes after time and effort spent on their issues. For some it could just be after few months of self dicipline and learning, for others it could be after years of therapy and/or medication.nnA tip I suggest is keeping a journal, only write in it when you are having a bad day, or after a social situation that put you in a bad mood. It helped me to look back a day later and 'deconstruct' the twisted view I had when I wrote it.nnIn terms of books I suggest ""The Solution to Social Anxiety"" by Aziz Gazipura, its not the shortest of books but it's an easy read none the less. For something more challenging, I'd say ""The Wisdom of Insecurity"" by Alan Watts, he's got a lot of books and even had a TV show about sociology and philosophy."

I'm making progress and a lot of it has been on my own but the therapy that I've been getting has been helpful too. I'm realizing the progress I've made makes new progress much easier."

When I told someone in my family about my struggles it made ***so*** much easier to tell more people, I've even told one of my bosses about it! I think talking to people about it is the best thing you can do, because not only will it help you feel OK about yourself, the people you tell will often want to help you. I also think that going to someone professionally, (like a therapist) would be good too. I'm seeing someone and just getting a professional perspective on it opened my eyes."
