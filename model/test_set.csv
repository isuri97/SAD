27,"evemsa1","comment","","Well hate to break it to ya, but there is no simple trick that instills confidence. For a lot of people there comes a time where it kind of 'clicks,' but that comes after time and effort spent on their issues. For some it could just be after few months of self dicipline and learning, for others it could be after years of therapy and/or medication.nnA tip I suggest is keeping a journal, only write in it when you are having a bad day, or after a social situation that put you in a bad mood. It helped me to look back a day later and 'deconstruct' the twisted view I had when I wrote it.nnIn terms of books I suggest ""The Solution to Social Anxiety"" by Aziz Gazipura, its not the shortest of books but it's an easy read none the less. For something more challenging, I'd say ""The Wisdom of Insecurity"" by Alan Watts, he's got a lot of books and even had a TV show about sociology and philosophy."
28,"evemsa1","comment","","Man after reading your comment I have to say I'm a little jealous, you sound like the person I want to be someday. I'm making progress and a lot of it has been on my own but the therapy that I've been getting has been helpful too. I'm realizing the progress I've made makes new progress much easier."
29,"evemsa1","comment","","Definitely ask for help man, I don't see a reason why not to. When I told someone in my family about my struggles it made ***so*** much easier to tell more people, I've even told one of my bosses about it! I think talking to people about it is the best thing you can do, because not only will it help you feel OK about yourself, the people you tell will often want to help you. I also think that going to someone professionally, (like a therapist) would be good too. I'm seeing someone and just getting a professional perspective on it opened my eyes."
36,"evemsa1","comment","","I too diagnosed myself at first but once I started seeing a therapist she agreed with me. She wanted to put me on some medication but I declined. It was a choice I made for personal reasons, but medication has been extremely helpful for a lot of people. And I agree with /user/lemon_rose, labels and names can be helpful in understanding what you're going through, but what matters most is trying to improve."
38,"evemsa1","comment","","Pretty much what he said. Repetition, otherwise known as exposure therapy. It's hard but probably the best way to overcome your struggles. nnGiving less fucks, also difficult but definitely possible. What I'm doing to work on both of those is going longboarding. It was intimidating at first but now that I've gotten some skill it's gotten easier to go for a cruise around town.nnShowing down; also important. I view it more as sharpening my focus. It might sound lame, but something I do is imagine s bubble around someone's head. It honestly has helped me pick up on things that I can add to whatever they're saying."
58,"evemsa1","comment","","I agree and disagree with you.nnSaying it won't help is wrong. I had SA that was so bad I wasn't able to look for work or go to school after high school. At some point i got so fed up with the way i was feeling and not doing anything about it that i just tried exposure therapy on my own. I started small like you should and just had the goal of saying hi to everyone i passed on my walks around my local park.nnFrom personal experience i can say that exposure therapy is probably the best thing you can do for yourself. I have a long way to go to I've also come a long way, all without professional help. I'm not saying i don't advise it, but i am saying you don't need it.nnAlso going into you worst fear will surely fail, definitely take small steps and gradually grow over time."
184,"iron_sheep","comment","","I have the same issue with my voice as well.  I also have the same issue with people, more specifically my roommates.  They tend to give very dull, one worded responses (i.e. ""yea"") whenever I try to start a topic of conversation, but when the other one speaks suddenly they get more involved.  I won't make this about me though.  Sometimes it is how you are perceiving the situation.  Maybe you think people are avoiding you, or perceive you as awkward, but you aren't.  You are trying, most people should be able to see that, and it's not something a decent person would fault you for.  If you have access to healthcare, why not see a doctor?  If anything, just to quell your anxieties.  "
199,"verdantveins","comment","","I was talking to my teacher today too and I felt my face flinch, it was just a casual discussion, I have no idea why. So embarrassing :/nnI hope you're okay. I can't even make eye contact with anyone, and when I feel my anxiety is showing I tear up a little bit?! even though there's nothing to cry about..nnIf you'd like to talk about with me on private message, I'm always checking reddit. Sometimes I think it's easier to talk to someone who experiences the same things as you than a therapist because there's more of a mutual understanding"
201,"environst","comment","","&gt;It's funny because I went in with this idea of ""I'm totally dead on the inside, I don't really feel much of anything unless something is really sad about loss or I get super angry."" And then I burst into tears and could barely speak a word my whole first session. I was shocked how much emotion I felt, but had rejected and kept bottled up, because whenever I showed any it was frowned upon and I was disconnected from people.nnThis is so true for me right now.  As an adult, I painstakingly avoid crying or yelling in front of others, even around people I've known for a long time, because it was always made it clear that those reactions weren't welcome, ever, without inviting judgement, shaming/guilting, ridicule or just having them ignored.  And it seems like holding those feelings back is getting harder nowadays, for better or worse.  There's one class I have that is a constant, agonizing reminder of my social failure with guys.  Most days I get through fairly well, considering, but once in a while, something will trigger all that pain and its all I can do to not breakdown right there in front of everyone.  nn&gt;Getting in touch with that part of yourself is really important, as rejecting that basically leads to you rejecting yourselfnnI really like this idea, I just have no idea what ""getting in touch"" looks like other than writing about it and crying a lot."
218,"Landons_Games","comment","","I had an interview for a job not that long ago. It was for an entry level job at speedway. I stuttered or either said "" can we come back to that?"" every single question. I blanked out on most of the questions too. The lady that interviewed me sounded like a bitch as well. Also, as soon as I walked into the warehouse for the interview I saw nothing but bugs stuck to the ceiling in the waiting room. I took this as a sign that this isn't for me. My future is brighter than this.nnnEdit: Also, what about phone calls bothers you? I know that if I talk to people I know (like my dad, mom, sisters) I'm fine. Contacting paypal or customer service numbers, is fine (depends on the person whether they are in a good mood or not). The only problem I have talking on the phone is when it's my grandma, uncle, my other sister (im not that close to her and she treats me like I'm not related to her); basically anyone I'm not around enough. I think since I've had multiple claims I was furious with on Paypal, no phone call is nearly as bad as it was before. nnI think making the call is the worst for me. After we start talking, the weight on my shoulders lifts off."
233,"DivinePrince2","comment","","Is it because you keep rejecting ideas to help cope? Because no therapist wants to work with someone who won't even bother to try. It's honestly a waste of their time."
234,"DivinePrince2","comment","","I wouldn't take anything off the internet. So no, sorry. I have my psychiatrist for that. And I will already be having a professional assessment soon for my disability application.nnAs it is now, the papers tell me I have 'moderate to severe' anxiety disorder. ( GAD and SAD)"
244,"D0WNV0TE_ME_PLS","comment","","It went great the doctor was very understanding (he had the same thing as a kid) and has given me a mental health plan which is where ill be doing 6 sessions with a psychologist which the costs of are paid for by this Australian health plan or something so thats good. I think that my SA is nowhere near as severe as some people have it so i think the 6 sessions will be really good for me and make it alot more managable, thanks again for the help btw :)"
249,"nonpersoninlimbo","comment","","I relate to some of this. Because of my hardcore social anxiety, I wasn't able to pay attention much in school because I was too busy being paranoid and worried. Same with college. I learned nothing because I was nervous out of mind the whole time. What a waste. I also don't relate to any of my peers. I don't relate to pretty much everyone. I think so radically different, and I'm so emotional and sensitive and negative and depressed that it drives people away. I'm at a point where I don't know what to say to anyone. I'm afraid to speak even if I do rarely think of something to say. I have actually said in the past that I'm a 12 year old stuck in a 20 year old body. I feel you. nThis is probably typical, but have you tried the whole meds n' therapy thing? It can be a battle, but you'll slowly make progress with the socializing bit. Is it easier for you to socialize with people you know well, like family members? Or is it still difficult? nYou definitely aren't ""dumb"". That's a trick our anxious and/or depressed minds play on us. You're obviously a thinker. Most of the stuff we learn in school we don't need in real life anyway. I don't think you need all that to socialize. I think it's just the anxiety creating a block.  "
255,"starsunnie","comment","","Ah, thanks for responding. I like what you said here. I think everybody needs a bit more internal affirmation. It's great to be settled and support the person that you are.  I love that. And I'm so for it. I absolutely love myself but I think sadly, that my love for myself can be sometimes twisted. For example, I know deep down that if I don't love myself, then who else will. It sounds sad, but, honestly, it's what I see as rebellious self-love. I approve of myself wholeheartedly, and know that I don't need another's approval. But, that external approval and comfort is crucial in children upbringing. I never had that, so I knew from a young age, that I would have to give that to myself. And me is more than enough. Always. Even right now that I'm expressing all of my concerns.n n I like the word valorate. :) And probably therapy. You're right. And as to your following question. I'm not sure. I hope it does. But more than that, I don't know how therapy can help someone who doesn't have a supportive group around them. You go in circles by yourself. When all you really want is someone who you trust that can go in circles with you, side by side, sometimes behind, sometimes in front.   n  nAhaha, I'm sort of sleepy. I offered some nonsense right back. Good luck to you. n  n"
256,"puddachop","comment","","I'd like to, I've been going through this and several other things since I was 11 years old, around the time the bullying was at an all time high and I was going through a great depression that I haven't fully recovered from to this day. I'm 17 now and and I've been trying to see a therapist since then. My mom, who is super religious, doesn't believe in that stuff and refuses to let me go. She tip toes around my problems, I can't talk to anybody, seeing the pastor doesn't help and everyone else just gives me bad advice and thinks I'm just going through ""a teenager thing"". My mom believes this as well"
284,"Deepinmyhead","comment","","Well don't resist it either.. Just like depression and other emotions. Accept that it's a chemical reaction in your body and your OK with that. Being congruent (thoughts words and actions aligned) makes things easier.) for myself I used exposure therapy in my car playing loud music, peeing in the center of the toilet not the side, making phone calls, emails, and recently going out for reasons other than work. A few big things I've noticed is that when you improve you become less conscious of what you are saying, it flows through you. So what I recommend are books like psycho cybernetics and the power of now or other books by eckhart tolle"
310,"Deepinmyhead","comment","","How many steps have you taken on your own? Nutrition, meditation, exercise, any books or videos that help you recognize and break away from social conditioning? So if motivation is an issue then you need to look into depression things which for me was nutrition. (The ultramind solution is a good book on this) once your motivated hit up the stuff I mentioned earlier and maybe add a couple books like the six pillars of self esteem or psycho cybernetics. Might as well save yourself some money by minimizing the amount of sessions you may or may not need by doing what you can first. Don't let yourself be convinced that you can't take these steps because you can. Really think about that."
319,"Rudoren","comment","","I feel the exact same way. I thought maybe it was the crowd I'm with, maybe these people aren't my true friends? Thing is if I look back I've had many ""friends"" and it's always been like this. Truth is I recently managed to get a girlfriend somehow and I could truly be open with her and feel like I belonged. We split up a few weeks ago and I've been thinking about this all the time since. When I'm with my friends who should bring me comfort from my breakup I just feel resent and like an outcast. UNfortunately I don't think I have anything important to offer here. Just wanted to say i'm going through the same thing and maybe there's a shit ton of people going through this, who knows? I've come to terms with everything today I think and my best move is probably therapy. I've always been against this notion but I'm 23 and just can't deal with this feeling anymore. I need a perspective change. "
400,"maverick-feist","comment","","The days after these events when you feel this horrible, have you ever kind of compartmentalized and tried to figure out if anything specific triggered it?nnFor example, is it the thought of ""maybe I did something that looked stupid/weird/etc."", like feeling insecure about yourself within a particular social setting *after* the fact, that made you feel horrible. Personally, I know I had moments in the past where maybe I had a good time out, but then the next day worried that I came off the wrong way or didn't think I really showed people who I was. It could also be a fear of letting your guard down/being vulnerable around others.nnOr, maybe you just get mentally drained from social gatherings. It's quite normal for many of us folks with SA to have a good time out, but then need a lot of time to ourselves to re-energize and relax.nnWhatever it is, take the time to try and analyze your thoughts and feelings to find out what triggers this feeling in you. Perhaps find a good therapist as well; sometimes it helps to talk it out with an objective outsider who is trained in this sort of thing."
432,"Rev991","comment","","I'm Swedish too, actually. nnWhile true that most people don't presenting stuff in front of the class it's not necessarily what a person with sa experiences.nnYou can do additional stuff instead of oral presentations? Heard similar stuff from people in the us but not Sweden. nLike if you talk to the schools SYV/SYO?nnMake sure I'm making the decision and not sa or something else you say.nnWell arbetsförmedlingen sent me on some ""activity"" that's supposed to help you get a job. And I've been asked a lot what I want to do. But the real answer is nothing/I don't know. Thinking about working some shit job my whole life just fills me with dread. I have a shitty part time job now and I hate every day I work. I hate the days leading up to it. I even hate the day before they call me to see what days I can work next week. I only take one day a week.nnI am apathetic towards.. a lot.  I have no hopes. No dreams. No aspirations. Nothing I want to do. I just go with the flow because.. well.. what else would I do. The only reason I even sent in an application for this (network design and computer management) is because I could show the people at the ""activity"" that look I did SOMETHING.nI don't know if I'm even fit for studying. I'm lazy.nI went to college before (had to study math physics programming before starting the real programme) and part of why I failed is me never asking questions in class. Part is I procrastinated until there was too much to do and there literally wasn't enough time to do it. nnnI didn't do it because I think it would be a great job or something. I like IT i guess but like I said. Apathetic towards the future.nnI don't know about the whole classes in English and even presentations in English.  Ugh.nnThe SYV (counselor or whatever) is going to ask me if I got in or not tomorrow.  I'll probably tell her I'm still marked as a reserve(eh, reservplats).nnDon't let sa make decisions for me? I think sa or going with the flow makes most decisions for me ;/"
436,"PhoenixHorizon","comment","","Definitely, my dad is exactly like this too. I was diagnosed with depression and GAD in high school and put on medication and through therapy for it, and when I'd struggle my dad would tell me the exact same thing. ""We all have problems; no one wants to do x, y, and z; you're not special, cowboy up and stop acting like a baby"". nIt's so shitty when a family member, of all people, refuses to understand things that you're going through. I'm really glad you seem to know that your feelings are valid and you have no obligations to keep those toxic people in your life ❤️"
496,"yndihalda1","comment","","Damn it to hell. I was so ready to be ecstatic for you. The only advice I can give is cliche as hell - focus all the anger and sadness into an outlet of improving your self confidence. Exercise is key - lift and you'll automatically gain confidence. I also really loved walking for both exercise and as an excuse to listen to my depressing and angry music that made me feel better. Meditation (I'm partial to progressive muscle relaxation) and breathing exercises are also really useful. If possible, consider counseling and antidepressants (just watch for side effects). All of this helped me immensely in your situation. I went from being a fly on the wall to having the time of my life in one summer - all thanks to self confidence I gained from these activities.nnAbove all, remember you probably wouldn't care to hang out with jackasses that get their kicks from hurting people. Your people are still out there, you just have to find them and be confident enough to be approachable. All of this stuff is really cliche but it's cliche for a reason: it just works. It's really hard to do all these things and develop habits but if you channel the emotion and use it for good i know you are capable. nnThere are always a thousand reasons to not do something! Start now and reap the rewards next semester as you start new classes."
509,"VinChi_","comment","","I'm not sure if you were looking for a woman's (22 y.o.) opinion on this post, but you look just fine. The flaws you say you have aren't that apparent and that beard is hella awesome.nnAs a person who also hasn't had a dating life, I understand how it is to feel invisible to the opposite sex. For years I believed I was ugly beyond measures, that nobody could possibly express interest in me since I had a combination of physical unattractiveness and bad personality. I learned recently (through therapy) that no matter how real or true they feel, those beliefs are irrational. Even if other peoples' actions seem to confirm the beliefs, it's likely due to self-fufilling prophecies, which is the idea that if you believe a negative thought (ex: ""nobody likes me"" or ""I never say the right thing"") your brain alters your behavior to make it true.nnYou're not unattractive to every woman you come across. Your thoughts may be telling you so, but in reality it's not true. I believe with the right confidence-building skills you'll start meeting women in no time."
514,"_blayke","comment","","I have been seeing a psychologist monthly for the last 6 months but it was originally to treat my depression and lack of motivation and I have never brought up SA. Judging by your post, I will definitely have to raise that issue the next time I see them as I think that SA is a massive factor leading to depression. I guess I have never really thought about specifically identifying individual fears as they all seem to just blur together and overwhelm me without letting me analyse them. Do you think that it is something I can work on by myself or should I just wait until I see my psychologist?nThanks for the help"
556,"throwaway5858582","comment","","I honestly think this is the problem as well, the solution is obviously the one I mentioned: ""speak up"". But I've tried practicing speaking loudly by reading aloud etc, but it never transfers over to when I talk to people. It's like I have constantly to think about it to work, but somehow in an anxious situation you forget about things like that.nnI've also noticed when I talk to people 1-on-1 in a quiet environment, like a doctors' room they can pretty much always hear what I am saying, but if there's people around, whether they're talking or not, it becomes way worse. That's a pretty common issue for people with SE from what I understand.nnI feel like my voice just doesn't stand out if there's any background noise, not sure if it's the volume, tone or what."
569,"Zancoh","comment","","But enough about the history. I could write a book about how bad my social anxiety is, and if I read it, I'd probably kill myself... lowkey. I don't even know how you kill yourself lowkey, but hey.nnMy social anxiety is pretty bad. Ever since I graduated in 2013, my confidence fell way lower due to lack of ANY social contact in 3 years. Even the fake confidence I had felt more real than whatever the fuck I'm feeling right now.nnNow, what does social anxiety mean to me? It means nothing to me... And yet it's everything. nnIt means 'nothing' in the sense that I don't see myself as a victim or see this as my identity and something to hold on to. I know it's all mental. nnIt means everything, because that's my life up to this point, and I have no choice but to accept it, and I can't change the past, but I damn well am gonna change my fucking future. I have to.nnLet me get into the details of it. What does social anxiety feel like? How has it affected me? How do I function with it?nn- Basically, I dread every social interaction, be it spoken or just walking the fucking sidewalk. That's how anxious I feel. I feel anxious for big events, presentations, parties, and even small things like getting a haircut, I feel anxious going to the supermarket, I feel anxious sitting at a bus stop, nearly everything... And just the thought of something social makes me feel tense.nn- I'm insecure about my looks. I check my mirror like 35 times a day, i check my hair and my clothing for like 15 mins before going out EVERY TIME. I compare my looks to everyone I see. 'Oh, I'm better dressed than him. Oh, that guys jawline intimidates me! Oh, how did this ugly cunt get that girl? Wow, that guy is so much better looking than me. My shoes suck compared to that guys...' Just the most ridiculous thoughts. Comparisons all around. Feels bad. Even when it feels good.nn- I am on edge at any given moment if there's at least one person with me. I am self-conscious to an insane degree. I monitor everything I do. I make everything look awkward as fuck, even opening a door or grabbing something off the shelf... It's weird explaining it, but I do it in a deliberate 'hope I look natural' kinda way, but I never feel natural unless I'm in my home. smhnn- I can't talk to girls. I can online to an extent, but never in person. I'm scared as shit to even try. I've never had sex or kissed a girl and I'm going on 26. Meanwhile, my twin brother has had girlfriends, lost his virginity at FOURTEEN, and has been with more girls than I can count... Oh, and he's shorter than me. He's 5'3'', and I'm 5'9''. So for all of you insecure about height, just know social anxiety fucks you over so much worse.nn- I get triggered by so many things. Groups of friends, guy with a girl, people talking about past relationships, etc. I feel like I missed out on so much. Hell, I DID miss out on so much.nn- Intimidated by social media. Especially instagram where everyone was a shitton of followers and every pic looks flawless. I can't take a selfie for shit. And I don't use any social media, although I would like to, but idk where to start. Whenever anyone asks me for facebook, or snapchat or instagram or whatever, I don't know how to answer them.nn- I am fidgety. I find it hard to sit or stand straight and relaxed. My hands and feet are always moving. I always look on edge.nn- This one annoys me and makes me feel fake, but I've been noticing for years that I put on a mask for every single person I meet. How I talk to them is not how I talk to anybody else. My tone of voice changes depending on the person, the content of what I say changes too. I'm mostly comfortable talking to people who I view as less 'cool' or less attractive than I am, or older people... I know, it's fucked up.nn- I have negative thoughts about myself A LOT. Even when something good happens, my mind spins it into a negative. I assume so much bad shit for myself, I have such a self defeating mindset, it's better to distract myself from thought most of the time.nnWith that said, despite all that, despite living in fear on a near daily basis, I'm not hopeless about it nor am I that bitter (although I am bitter. I'm human, after all, and I'm lacking basic human needs here). In fact, I've enjoyed my life. I'm of sound body and mind, I'm financially stable, etc. Things could be worse. nnThings could be much worse, BUT this doesn't mean I'm just gonna give up on eliminating this issue, and yes I truly believe you can eliminate social anxiety, and no not with medication... In fact, I've never taken medication for it, I've never been to a doctor or therapist or whatever for it, because I'm not convinced it's a real medical disorder, but in fact a set of habits and thought patterns that influence your behavior, and this can be fixed.nnI just need to know how to go about doing this. I'm going to give exposure a legitimate shot, and report back on my experiences. Good luck, me.nnThanks for reading. And yes, It was hard typing all this out, holy shit."
597,"caitietea","comment","","The best piece of advice I ever got from therapy is fake it till you make it. Apply for jobs, pretend like you aren't anxious, it's super hard at first, and you're going to struggle a lot with it but it's okay and you need to remind yourself that it's okay. Once I got my job I realized that while I'm working I'm no longer myself, I'm just an employee. Once I got that mindset I'm a whole other person at work (I'm a cashier) it doesn't go away completely, and I still have days where I feel like I can't possibly deal with it but it helps a lot. You're going to be okay, it just takes baby steps. A lot of places have applications online! Once you take that big step you can be proud of yourself and continue making little steps. Don't give up!"
607,"NoahPete","comment","","Can someone help me? I have no family or friends to talk to. My entire friend group was extremely close with me just months ago, but since has distanced themselves from me and I've tried talking with them about it. I ask them why they do stuff without me, make group chats without me, and ignore me, yet they say they don't. I tell them it makes me incredibly distraught when they do this, but they can't handle a talk about depression. Just recently they told me they've distanced because I am low-key critical of them when hanging together and that I'm too clingy. I can't think of a way to try to be close with them without being clingy, though. If I don't try to arrange plans with them, we don't do anything. If I try to arrange plans, they do stuff without me. I don't have options for other friends at this point and I've been doing therapy. If anyone else can share thoughts with me it would be appreciated beyond belief.﻿"

625,"EarthaKittKat","comment","","The dentist and/or hygienist typically aren't looking into your eyes but inside of your mouth only, and the effect is similar to that of someone whose gaze is focused just above or beyond your head (especially that up close and personal). I know for me it has always felt very impersonal. They may lift their eyes to ask a question, but all you see are a pair of brown, grey, blue, green (etc.) eyes above a white mask. They have a job to do, and in their chair, a lot of the time you are merely two rows of teeth that need some TLC. *You* are not the center of attention, but your teeth.nnWhen I'm laid back under the bright white light and they are peering into my mouth, I merely look past their heads at the ceiling and let them do their job. It helps me to know they are only focusing on what needs to be done inside of my mouth, and all I have to do is attempt to keep my tongue down and my cheeks wide open to grant them better access to it.nnIn making an appointment, what has always helped me in making these sort of official calls is to write down what I will say and then read it conversationally off the page. That way I have a script and I don't leave anything out. I just read it. If you are unsure of what, exactly, to say, I would start with something of ""Hello, I would like to make an appointment. I was wondering when your next openings are...?"" They will often take over and lead you in the rest, asking what time and on what day and yadda yadda. "
626,"evemsa1","comment","","For starters I want to say that I don't suffer from SA nearly as bad as I used to, but the one area that I have always (and probably will always) suffer from is when I'm at a social gathering.nnI'm the kind of person you described as someone who almost forces themselves into social situations in hopes that something changes but ends up at the bottom of the ladder. I wish I could say I prefer solitude but personally that makes it worse for me. It's almost impossibly hard for me to juggle between wanting to hang out with friends and wanting to shut myself in. In the end though I would say that going out socializing is for your benefit, but like almost everything there's a certain amount of skill that's involved with socializing, and like all skills there's a learning curve to it.nnNow I've been to drug-free therapy in the past and it was helpful in some areas; mindfulness, rationalization, and even self confidence. But outside of that I've taken the head on approach, and I don't know how far it can take me but for the most part it's been successful. It's also caused some bad times (negative self-talk) but I still think it's been good for me in the end; I've really seen my character develop and there's a number of people who actually like my personality (crazy right?).nnI still spend a fair share of my time alone, I'm a pretty introverted person, but I recently moved in with someone for the first time and having a room mate has been pretty fun as well as a learning experience. Sadly like all things in life there's no *true* book on how to adapt to situations that are new, the only way to learn is to be in those situations, and boy can it be rough some times, let me tell you. But the way I see it is I only have one life, so doing something and becoming the idiot is just one of the many ways I can use the time I've got, so in the end it doesn't really matter how you ""waste your time"" as I like to put it, because in the end we really are all the same.nnAgony is what connects us, we all suffer from that voice in our heads, and this is not news. The real challenge to life is over coming the walls we build over the course of our life, and it **will** be hard to tear them down, but you can only grow when you're at your lowest low."
630,"evemsa1","comment","","Wow, a much tougher read than what I was expecting. First off I want to say if you feel you are in danger please, please tell somebody, there are so many cases of children who feel powerless to their parents but in reality they are a front-door away from freedom.nnI can't speak for your mother more than I can speak for anyone else but it seems like she's pretty controlling, and that is *her* problem, not yours. Unfortunately that kind of makes you an easy target having SA; that being said you should mentally and physically step away from her as best you can. On your days off grab your board and just cruise, tell her your going to the park if that's what it takes. Coming from someone who also had family problems but in the opposite sense (coddling so much to the point of letting me sit in my room all day for weeks on end) I just couldn't handle the amount of laziness that stewed in my household, so one day I grabbed my sister's old longboard, my ipod and some headphones and just rode with no destination in mind. And doing that cleared my head soooo much. I think that is more important for you right now too, rather that focusing on getting friends or getting good are skating, becoming clear minded and focused will do you a heap of good for your self confidence. (There's an app called Headspace that I use all the time, it practices mindfulness and is incredibly beneficial for clearing your thoughts, I recommend this to anyone, whether they suffer from SA or not.)nnShe suggested therapy, and even if it was a joke that's exactly what I suggest. It might be tough opening up in the beginning, it sure was for me, but after a while I think you will see the benefits. Having another person to get shit off your chest is almost a must when it comes to living in a first world country.nnI hate to kind of say this but it doesn't seem like she's happy being a mother, and that doesn't make for a fit parent, but you can use this to your advantage. In your head you can say she's a bad parent therefore she doesn't know who you truly are, the trouble is the amount of ""power"" she has over you, and I use quotations here because it's just an illusion of power. The only power she has is what you give her, and I don't know how old you are but you seem old enough to know bad parenting when you see it.nnMy final thoughts are to spend more time away from her and out of the house, if that means spending more time alone than so be it, that gives you the opportunity to strengthen your mind and become someone else than what she's led you to believe. There's only two things in this world I deem as truth: follow the golden rule and time heals all wounds. There's only one thing stopping you from being the person you want to be, and that's yourself.nnPlease man, if you ever want to talk to someone send me a private message and I'll send you my number, you sound like a good kid in a shitty situation, and that's not your fault!"
631,"aBunburyist","comment","","Thank you, and of course. I want to start with nutrition because I think this alone arguably has a higher impact than exercise. The number 1 thing I reccommend is completely cutting out from your diet unnecessary sugar. Not to say all sugar is bad, but sodas, candy, and doughnuts are easy things to cut out that do you no good. Even fruit drinks like orange juice are suprisingly saturated with sugar, so I got rid of those. I only ever now consume sugar if its hard to avoid (like in milk), if I can use it for workout purposes (like a post workout shake with sugar carbs to aid recovery), or an ocassional dessert.n nNext up goes hand in hand with cutting out sugary drinks - drink water. I try to drink as much water as I can, and I've noticeably felt better after eliminating my constant need for sugar.nnNow outside of those simple changes, my normal meals aren't perfect but I try to stick to home cooked meals as much as possible, though chipotle is my guilty pleasure. Lean meats and fish, complex carbs like brown rice over white rice, and different assortments of green vegetables. I usually have a tuna salad once or twice a week for my meals. All of this has also made me feel better and sharper mentally, as opposed to how I used to feel after greasy fast food or cheap easy prep meals.nnMy initial workouts sucked. I went to the gym not knowing what the hell I was doing and not seeing any results. Then I tried overeating, and that just gave me a fat stomach with not much muscle mass to show for. This truly is different for everyone because everyone's body works differently and there isn't one magic solution that will work for all, so you'll need to experiment and research. For me, I have a skinny fat phsyique that's the result of years of sitting on my ass and being inactive. To tackle this, im currently going to the gym 4 times a week doing muscle training, 1 day each for a different muscle group, and finishing with 20 mins of cardio. Then I'm dedicating another day to 15-20 min of high intensity interval training, where I'm alternating between sprinting and walking. I have to say though, throughout all my workout sessions, as good and bad as they have been, I have always felt good afterwards. Even to experience that feeling makes it so worth it.n"
637,"Rasljice","comment","","I can tell you firsthand (as someone who is conventionally attractive), that this does nothing for you in terms of the severity of sa. For me, the idea that people who are seen as pretty must be outgoing and confident makes me feel even more worthless and socially inept. Being ""ugly/unattractive"" or being ""pretty/attractive"" does nothing for you. Sure, you might get treated differently by people due to this, but how people interact with me affects my actions in NO WAY. I feel the pressure of society's idea that attractiveness=confidence and easier social skills on the daily. People approach me and expect this bubbly outgoing personality but all that comes out is awkwardness. Then that leads to my family members and friends to ask me ALL THE TIME ""you're gorgeous, act like it! Why aren't you confident? You could get any guy, how come you haven't had a boyfriend yet??"" Social anxiety is about how you perceive the world around you, and is independent of whatever people do. For me at least, it's an endless cycle of self-depreciation and feeling of being judged by others. Grass is always greener on the other side. I sometimes think that if I looked different, at least people wouldn't expect all of these things of me. I'd have an excuse for being the way I am. But I don't. (Not that I am saying ""unattractiveness""=social anxiety, but that is how society usually sees it.)  nnSocial anxiety comes from the mind, your thoughts, not your body. "

For example my brother left school at 16, he was just done with education completely and he's been in work ever since. Obviously it's easy when you aren't plagued with problems or if you have connections, but my point is realise your accomplishments and also that EDUCATION isn't everything. nnEven if you go into all that debt for a degree, it doesn't guarantee you a job and that's something that scares me.nnHow old are you, if you don't mind me asking?

When it came 3 days to the appointment, I freaked out because I realized it meant I would have to drive downtown through my city's main street and busy streets. I am deathly afraid of driving in tight urban areas like that, and I have shame and embarrassment from being involved in a fender-bender 4 years prior.nnSo what did I do? I sent my would-be vocational counselor an email saying I couldn't go to the appointment, and I then blocked his email so that I would not get any emails from him. Ten months later, and I still don't work and have never worked a day in my life. I also dropped out of college twice, so I don't really feel any sense of accomplishment.nnThere are just so many things in life that I don't know the steps to and I don't feel confident in doing unless I know how to do it 99.9%. I can't just wing something and pretend like I can do it easily, and there are few things in life that I am decent in.nnWhat was I trying to say?

645,"aestheticcompulsive","comment","","Good for you! I just wanted to add something to your first goal, if I may. nnA while ago, I went to a psychologist for my anxiety.  I was put on some medicine &amp; it was absolutely dreadful.. It made me feel like a zombie. I couldn't experience happiness or sadness. I was just floating through my day &amp; nothing mattered. That is no way to live life. I was probably 13 at the time. (I don't remember the medication name, unfortunately.) They insisted that it was great for me to be drugged up &amp; stoic 24/7. I ingested these medications for months until I put my foot down because I was tired of not feeling anything. Bizarre. nnBasically, what I'm getting at is please don't just take their word for it. You know how you feel more than your doctor does. Don't simply take anyone's word ever (not even mine, hah). Research the hell out of the meds before you take them. You want to know what you're putting in your body &amp; how it might effect you. If you decide to take them, be objective. I hope everything works out in your favor.:)nnI wish you the best of luck.

654,"OhHaiStranger","comment","","It differs for everyone and can manifest itself in some situations and not others. Personally I have terrible anxiety when it comes to talking on the phone and in groups of people I don't know. Here are a few examples of how I feel. nn-Whenever I'm in class and I want to raise my hand and speak up I start getting chills and shaky hands. nn-When I'm talking to a new person I have a tendency of forgetting words. nn-When at a party that I'm unfamiliar with or a group setting and completely sober I will try to shrink myself into a corner or away from people. nn-I often find myself holding anything i have to grab onto in front of me to cover up. nn-Recently I went to stay with my bf at his university and I was terrified of disrupting his roommate in anyway and extremely afraid he would dislike me. The same thing happened when I stayed with his family. nn-Whenever I wear anything that isn't a t-shirt and leggings, or a sweatshirt and leggings, or put any effort into my outfit I feel completely anxious that people will think I look ridiculous. nn-I have pretty bad anxiety in the restroom. I often can't pee if I think anyone is standing near enough to the bathroom to hear. I've been dating my bf for a few months now and I still make sure that there are two doors shut between me and the bathroom at any given time. An empty public restroom is my sanctuary.nn-I'm afraid of posting on social media (fb mostly) for fear that what I'm saying is stupid. I post a couple times a month, usually. And delete more than half of what I have to say. nn-i haven't been able to go into a store by myself in months. Grocery shopping is hell. I haven't gone by myself since last summer.  nnThere's more but that's all I can think of right now.

It may have been caused by a bully or shameful event that made you start hating yourself. One thing that's helped me along the way is to realize that I have no control over what others think about me. What you have control over is what you think of yourself and the power to do something about it. nnIt's not easy to change a mindset that has been rooted in shame and guilt for such a long time but beyond therapy the only thing we can do is to improve and continue. Do something that will make yourself proud. If you don't feel like you belong with your family then find a family of your own, find friends that you can truly call friends.

708,"aestheticcompulsive","comment","","Meditation is great. Please don't let the anxiety scare you off! Start out with just five minutes a day.nn I've been meditating on &amp; off (super inconsistently) for about two years. When you're doing it as rarely as I was, it won't help much or at all. Now that I've been consistent in my meditation practice for about two months, I have made more progress than I have in probably the last two years. I can't wait to see how I feel in six months, or a year from now!nnnYes! It has helped me be more introspective when it comes to my feelings &amp; emotions. I can better recognize my negative thoughts (patterns) thus preventing me going into a more panicked state. I can look at things objectively &amp; understand how insignificant some things are. For example, I used to get tons of anxiety before speaking on the phone. I would even go as far to make an outline of a script &amp; rehearse it several times (before calling to make a doctors appointment) so I wouldn't mess up. I've ""embraced"" my awkwardness more or less. I just let it go. When I stutter, or stumble over my words, I don't get caught up on it. Things like that, I've realized just don't matter. You're always told cliche stuff like ""love yourself"" &amp; ""don't care what others think."" Meditation has helped me internalize these things. nnAlso, I have an alarm set on my phone to go off once every hour. It reminds me to focus on my breathing. I take just a few deep breaths &amp; it re-centers me. (I also do this when I'm feeling annoyed/discouraged/angry/etc.) It brings me into a state of awareness in the present moment. This, I believe has helped me with quit a few things, not just with anxiety. I'm far more patient, relaxed, forgiving, resilient because I've learned to just let things go. nnI am not cured by any means. I still have a ways to go, but this is the only thing that has had such an astounding impact on me &amp; my anxiety. Do some more research if you're interested. You can also message me if you have any more questions. I am not an expert, but perhaps I can help somehow. nnHappy meditating :) "

But at the same time I have this feeling that they might not be able to understand my situation and therefore just tell me to be strong. nnFurthermore, I have this feeling of guilt/shame in a way. I guess my anxiety makes me afraid of showing weakness and opening up to even the closest people in my life. I have never been diagnosed with anything, as I have been trying to ignore the problem/hoping for it to grow away, and I can't stop having these mixed thought of ""Why am I complaining, it could be so much worse"" and ""Why do I have to deal with this, it is ruining my life"". Normally because I both have good and bad days. "
741,"megalohead","comment","","I am not qualified to diagnose you, but I will say that all of these experiences you are telling me are exactly the same ones that I had when I was a young teen. Now in my early twenties, some have subsided, but there are persistent elements of SA that have remained. I was ""diagnosed"" with SA and currently am in CBT and taking medicine. Your mother is wrong, you are not ""choosing to be anxious,"" but she is also right in the sense that it is negative self-talk that *contributes* to anxieties, but does not completely cause it. nnHigh school is tough, as cliche as that is. I had to go through high school and college with SA, and I would suggest that instead of waiting forever, you seek professional mental health care. There is no shame in it, and working on it now as a teen will help you grow into a healthier adult. I promise.nnThanks for sharing. Have a good day."
743,"aLaSeconde","comment","","I will actually say that it is beneficial.  Trying something that you may not like is good because:nn1) you *may* not like it..you won't know until you do it. n2) The only reason you think you might not like it has nothing to do with the activity itself but more likely because you might have anxiety doing it.nnThis is known as exposure therapy in psychology.  Granted, if you tried it and didn't like because the activity itself wasn't actually interesting to you in the end, then by all means, stop doing it.  But if you only don't like it because it causes you anxiety, then it's all of the more reason to push yourself to do it more and more."
744,"aLaSeconde","comment","","Though while I agree with the poster that said ""it originates in the mind and can be healed with the mind"" I feel like that can only go so far.  The mind and the brain can essentially be defined as two different entities.  If you understand how the *brain* works in the electro-chemical sense, you'd understand that if there is an imbalance of chemicals in the brain, it can lead to physical feelings of anxiety.  With this, sometimes medication is the only way to re-balance that.nnThat being said, the physical feelings of anxiety can be what leads you to the gnawing thoughts.  The medication can fix the physical feelings but often won't have an impact on the *mind*/conscious (or the thoughts that come with anxiety).  The only way to stop those thoughts is with therapy and therapy techniques.  Utilizing different therapy aspects like talk therapy can help in working out your thoughts into a conscious and consistent manner which can help you understand them and yourself better leading you to the ability to correct them.  A technique in psychology known as ""thought-stop"" uses the aspect of recognizing when you have a negative or anxious thought, literally telling yourself ""stop,"" and then proceeding to re-correct your thinking.nnSo I would say that both can be essential.  For me, I was on medications for about 3 months before deciding to stop using it (a combination of forgetting to take it and not really feeling much of a change when I did) and going to therapy for 3 years instead.  So while a lot of my thoughts have been corrected (I still have anxiety though, just not nearly as bad as it used to be), I still have physical feelings of anxiety that include excessive sweating, blushing, stomach pains, etc.  I won't necessarily say that it's because I am not on medication, but I would say that a lot of those physical feelings do tend to go away when I bum Xanax off of my cousin :)"
748,"evemsa1","comment","","Hmm I guess I couldn't find the article in your link, It seemed to be a mixture of a few, or maybe I'm just blind.nnNonetheless I wanted to share my thoughts on this subject for I'm a daily toker and I feel it has worsened my SA. I started smoking pot about 4 years ago, just out of curiosity I wanted to try it. I tried some and told my smoker-friends about it and we started smoking regularly (about 3-4 times a week). I have to say it was super fun smoking with friends and listening to music, laughing at anything and everything. But soon the effects started to weaken, we would have to smoke more and more and eventually (at least for me) the effects changed entirely. What used to be a uplifting and almost energizing has, become just a dull-dissociation from reality.nnVery rarely do I get the giggles anymore, these days I either smoke with my roommate or alone. Now it's become something to make wasting time less painful, or rather to make the day end sooner. Unfortunately these days I tend to get irritable when I smoke alone, my routine is to get a buzz going and hop into a game or movie/tv show, but I find myself angry at times for being high. I can't really explain it other than deep down I know I'm letting myself down by continuing to do something that has lost my interest/approval. nnI've cut back on how much I used to smoke, what used to be all day everyday is now down to just at nights when I feel the day has ""ended."" My thoughts and feeling about pot are just that, *mine*, and it's no secret that pot has different effects on different people.nnWhat sort of bugs me about this pot movement is that some people seem to think that not only is it our right to smoke, but we deserve to, like we've earned it for putting up with how our government treats us. Maybe I'm just talking out my ass but I was straight-edge for 20 years before I smoke or drank anything, hell I didn't start cursing until I was 19, and I remember having my innocence back then. I remember thinking I didn't want to try anything because I didn't need it. Of course it's your choice to give it a whirl, I'm glad I did, I have a lot of good memories with good people. All I'm warning is to not let it take hold of you, I think the best way to overcome SA is to be as thoughtful and mindful as possible, and with a sober mind you can make the clearest decisions."
753,"SuperSleuth119","comment","","I realized this exact same thing myself recently and told my counselor about it. I realized that any kind of mistake I made throughout my life felt like some kind of moral deficiency on my part instead of just a mistake.

759,"evemsa1","comment","","Something that really helped me was giving myself some alone time. Now I know what your thinking, you've probably got more alone time than you know what to do with, but how often do you use that time to actively improve yourself?nnAt my lowest point I couldn't even look passer-bys in the face, so I made it a point to go for a walk everyday and smile and nod to almost anyone that I passed. Eventually I worked up to the point where I would actually say hi to them, and because of that I now have a customer service job that I feel comfortable with (for the most part anyway).nnIt's kind of strange isn't it? Having your SA worsen over time, you'd think it would do the opposite. But like almost anything, socializing is a skill, and like all skills you have to work on them to strengthen them. I've still got a long way to go, and at the moment I've been somewhat complacent on my progress which eats away at me. nnLong story short immersion is a great tool you can use to better yourself, most therapists will say that exposure therapy for any phobia is what can lead to the best results. Stay true to yourself and be open to the possibility of change!"
774,"evemsa1","comment","","Hate to tell you what you already know, but trial and error is the best way. Exposure therapy. Something that I first did when I started to try and improve my SA was to go to my local park and just go for walks. I made it a point to smile and nod to everyone I passed, and eventually gave a verbal ""hi there"" or ""hey."" I won't forget how hard that was at the time, and how far I've come *because* of those days.nnSo bars and clubs don't really vibe with you, they aren't my thing either unless someone invites me, but there are other outlets! If you have a local card shop or board game shop I would bet they have weekly gatherings and play MTG or Monopoly (these kinds of places tend to attract a crowd of people with SA and as I'm sure you can guess they are very welcoming people.)nnI also spend a lot of time with my sisters, I can honestly call them my best friends! They have helped me tremendously with my SA, I've got a long ways to go, like yourself I've never been in a relationship. I try not to let that get me down though, it's a daily struggle but I try hard to have a positive outlook, and I'm very proud of that.nnI would say your best bet to developing friendships is to find them within your work. It's tough I know, god do I know, but more often than not if you're kind to people and have a genuine interest in what they say and who they are you will naturally fall into a routine with them, who knows, maybe they will invite you out somewhere!"
782,"SexyStrexxity","comment","","I hear ya man.. I turn almost 21 this year and have social anxiety pretty badly. I can say it is not as severe as having to drop out of school but it was pretty close to it.nnA few things I can tell you: 1) Mindfulness. Something I SHOULD practice more of.. but mindfulness is a form of meditation to help bring your mind out of the constant state of thinking (i.e. about if others are judging me) and brings you to a complete focused state. Look up mindfulness audio sessions or something like that on google, there is plenty of tutorials and things to help.nn2) ""Don't break the chain"" ..its something the famous comedian Jerry Sienfeld talked about. This is a comedian who has done so many stand up routines that it seemed so unlikely he was able to write that many jokes! How does he do so many one hour specials?! He mentioned it was something he calls ""dont break the chain,"" or in other words he would write a joke every single day, good or not, but do so EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. nnThe reason I say this is because you should find something to work on every single day, no matter what! I myself joined a gym about a year and a half ago.. it was not because I wanted to lose weight (though that was on my mind as well) but because I needed some constant factor in my life that I would put forth effort each day to complete, something I HAD to do, to keep my mind on it..nYou should find something to do, even if it's just drawing a small picture or running a mile.. do it EVERY DAY! And if for whatever reason you can't.. just do it the next day!nnIn all of my years in dealing with social anxiety (and a negative family putting me down) I realize that the anxiety stems mostly from overthinking. Is that person looking at me from their car as I walk down the street? Am I worthless because I don't have a job? Is what I'm wearing okay? etc. the list is endless.nnFor me, social anxiety has stopped me from my potential being fully realized. It has stopped me from having a healthy relationship with pretty much any woman. It has stopped me from going out on the few beautiful days I see here.. nnI still have it, but not as bad. I practice a few things every day and you eventually reach a point of self confidence. You will know when you start to get comfortable with yourself and you start having thoughts like  ""who gives a shit what they think! This is what I'M doing for me!"" nnOne last note: I currently live in an area where cannabis is legal for recreational use. I started smoking not for my social anxiety itself but the fact that many other people here seemed to do it. I started smoking to make friends but now I keep smoking because it does make me feel good and content with the world around me.nnNot saying you should smoke pot but it is something that has helped me very greatly.nnHopefully I was of some help, either way the best of luck to you!"

It also helps you develop socializing skills with the general public. (But at the same time can be stressful and taxing). Just having someone to talk to, whether it's a coworker or a customer, can be helpful. nnJoining clubs/hobbies outside of school can help you meet like-minded people. "
839,"Bratzo","comment","","Ok this may seem too much but I'll try. n2 years ago I found this sport called Crossfit, it is a kind of high intensity workout routine where you'll perform all kind of exercises (from weighlifting to gymnastic or simple running). It doesn't require any kind of experience,literally when I went in the first time I was extremely weak (the classic shy/social anxious person who sucked at sports his entire life). nnThe reason why I loved it is because the workout sessions are structured like 1 hour long group classes, this allow people who go on the same hour to bond and socialize (or if you feel like not talking to anybody you can just do that). It may seem overwhelming at the beginning but I met many great people since I started, and also improved my look and confidence. nnI suggest you to give it a try if there is any Crossfit gym near you, it will help you go out of your comfort zone while being in a very friendly and stimulating environment."
860,"carefreewithme","comment","","The reason I've not sought help for the 15 years I've had this problem is because of the fact that it's so strange and morally taboo, yet it's had a serious impact on my life to date. You're not ""supposed"" to be closed off to your parents, it's morally wrong or something. Thankfully I have a shrink's visit tomorrow, I hope that they are helpful and understanding and can help me work through my problems. My boyfriend is also very supportive.nnI somewhat agree with the last point. I moved away from the problem in university and while I experienced the anxiety far less there was still a bit of it when I visited for holidays etc, it just didn't occupy my mind on the daily. I had enough of my own life to build the confidence I need to find myself, and not be chained up by negative perceptions based on the idiot I was as a teen."

I wouldn't say it didn't help at all, but they also didn't have that much of an effect on me. I'm the kind of socially anxious person who was also scared of what the therapist might think of me, so I was holding my thoughts back and I ended up giving up on it. But my desire to overcome my anxiety was (and is) still strong so I started working on it by myself (by giving myself small challenges and putting myself in uncomfortable positions). My anxiety is far from being gone, but when I compare myself to how I was 5 years ago (I'm 22), the difference is pretty big. "
915,"Nemstev","comment","","That's understandable, though you have to weigh the risk of taking medication against your quality of life: Is it really worth avoiding treatment and having to live with persistent anxiety? Back when I first started developing social anxiety and depression I rejected the medication they offered me because, like you, I was worried about the possible side effects. In the end though, my depression became so bad that it developed into a full-blown psychosis, and I was forced onto antipsychotics that made me almost zombie-like, always tired and have a voracious appetite (which caused massive weight gain). I'm not saying the same could happen to you if you don't take medication, but I'd highly advise seeking some professional help before it becomes worse."

(Even if you're not going for a tan you're going to get one anyway, and will have to visit multiple times.) Not to mention that it greatly increases your chances of getting skin cancer. It almost certainly won't have the effect you're thinking of in the short term. You'll just look tanned and baby faced. If anything you should be thinking about wearing sun screen so you retain your good skin as it becomes your ally as you age.nnHere's a snippet from wikipedia.nn&gt; Indoor tanning is associated with skin aging, sunburn, photodrug reactions, skin cancer, infections, weakening of the immune system, and damage to the eyes, including cataracts, photokeratitis (snow blindness) and eye cancer.[11][12][13] Injuries caused by tanning devices lead to over 3,000 emergency-room cases a year in the United States alone.[d] Physicians may use or recommend tanning devices to treat skin conditions such as psoriasis, but the World Health Organization does not recommend their use for cosmetic purposes.[15][16] The WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer includes tanning devices, along with ultraviolet radiation from the sun, in its list of group 1 carcinogens.[13]nnGo ahead if you want, but I think it's counter intuitive, especially given that there is plenty of UV... outside.nnhttp://sunburnmap.com/"

Honestly the only that has been working for me, is actually leaving the house and being in public. If you do something enough you eventually get use to it. My SA is a lot more manageable and honestly doesn't really bother me anymore BUT I did develop a ""side effect"" to anxiety that it horrible. I sweat, a lot under my arms. Every time I leave the house and I don't even feel nervous. Just me thinking about going places makesI me sweat. Its honestly worst than SA because I could at least hide my SA but you can't hide giant sweat marks under your arms. Its so bad its like constant drops rolling down my side just after a couple minutes of driving away from my house. Now I have to find out how to deal with this problem, probably gonna have to be surgery. Anyways basically what you need to do is take your gf out of the house. Start with less busy places and try to do it everyday. My gf has been so supportive for me. She's honestly made doing things outside the house so much easier. I'm sure your gf feels the same with you. Just remember, a pill won't make your problems go away and please explain that to your gf. I had horrible side effects to that shit and a bad withdrawal.

My anxiety is pretty specific. I used to have general anxiety disorder and depression as a teenager. Eventually it became social anxiety and the more general anxiety went away. I guess my social anxiety has improved in some areas and gotten worse in others. I can go most places and do most things with only minor anxiety. Yet, my fears of work and judgement by people in authoritative positions have gotten considerably worse. I'm trying to be optimistic that when I become an accountant I'll feel better.

I'm to the point now where I can be at a urinal and release without any interruption, and the dude can even walk up the urinal right next to mine, as long as there's a divider.

Then I picked up smoking &amp; felt better so I discontinued the counseling. In hindsight, I should. Ever have done that.nnI did some research &amp; from what I've read, you're probably right. I think what I am experiencing is severe anxiety symptoms related to traumatic experiences from being bullied &amp; humiliated daily when I was a kid - pre-k all the way up to about 10th grade, my family never accepting me for who I am, past abusive relationships, &amp; just an overall constant feeling that I am different from other people in many ways &amp; have trouble relating to them if I feel we have nothing in common.nnLike I said - since I quit smoking &amp; drinking, I've been experiencing this feeling of being an outsider or not fitting in &amp; not belonging more &amp; more. So I'm pretty sure that feeling is taking me back to when I was the weird kid that everyone picked on &amp; had no friends. nnI'm afraid of getting into an argument with my BF over something stupid...which most likely happens due to my hyper-vigilance/paranoia.

I'm their friend's gf. nnI realize that what I need to do is remember what it was like to not give a shit about them liking or disliking me. I need to stop caring what they think of me.

I was shy, quiet, and friends mostly with the other quiet kids or people that took me under their wing. School exhausted me, but I would come home to my giant family and neighborhood and be bouncing off the walls. nnAs I got older, I developed that natural dose of being self conscious and it exacerbated the whole problem. No one ever bullied me and I had a handful of very good friends, but I was always paranoid that people thought I was weird and whatnot. If I did something that I thought was embarrassing even in the slightest, I would just miss school for a few days. Turns out that old habits die hard and I have the awful habit of just checking out of life every now and then."

1187,"UbiquitinHat","comment","","It seems really odd that a lecturer would approach a student in class to discuss another student's condition/disorder, so I'm thinking it's more likely that maybe he just picked it up on his own? People are sometimes more perceptive than we give them credit for. The timing could have just been a coincidence since presentations were coming up.nnIf the lecturer did approach him to discuss your difficulties, maybe she did it so that he could convince you to give a presentation because she didn't want it to look like you were getting special treatment (???)nnThird, is it possible that he just overheard you talking to your lecturer?

1206,"justasyoulikeit","comment","","yes I can relate, you don't want them to see you for what you really are. A tip I would give is to look at their eyes to determine their eye colour....ok, so their eyes are blue....what kind of blue? sea blue, electric blue, dark rings around the iris? have they got big bushy eyebrows or a few little hairs? have they got makeup on them? if not, maybe you could try to imagine makeup on them. Do they have bags or visible veins under their eyes? Do they blink excessively? do you think they have good vision or bad vision? Are they good at keeping eye contact with you?nnPractice watching youtube tutorials of people speaking and focus on their eyes for practising this technique. (You'll be an eye expert as a weird side effect of your therapy.) nnIt will still hurt you to look but try to divert your attention to little interesting physical details about their eyes and you will find yourself looking at them more than you realised you could. If you become interested in them then you will take some of the pressure off of yourself.  I hope this helps. n"
1207,"justasyoulikeit","comment","","Yes it's possible without drugs and psychologist. The problem is, is that there are so many damaging misconceptions about social anxiety how to relieve yourself from it. Most people think you have to remove negative thoughts from your head and fill your head with positive thoughts but this is an exhausting and fruitless exercise. Instead we must accommodate our negative thoughts and feelings, listen to what they have to say and decide whether they are useful to us or not. nnYou talk about sweating profusely and nerves building to excessive levels, anxiousness hitting your stomach like a pound of ham. It's great that you seem so in touch with the way that you feel, that you can describe it with such colour.nnOut of the places mentioned, where do you want to visit the most, restaurant, beach, coffee shop, or somewhere else? What is it about the place that brings you pleasure? for example: the feel of the sand between your toes on the beach or the roasted smell of the coffee in your cup at the coffee shop? Have a think about it and make it your primary focus when you visit them. You will probably still feel like you're being stabbed in the gut with an anxiety knife but don't let it stop you from experiencing the real sensations going on around you (focus on the touch, smells, tastes, sounds, sights). This will help you to prove to your brain that it doesn't need to protect you as fiercely as it already does. nnEventually your negative feelings will start to feel a bit redundant because you're not really letting them guide your actions anymore. With this, they will get naturally less severe and a little quieter and you will feel like you've awoken from a horrible nightmare and feel relieved.nnI recommend the 'Candice Esposito', 'Calm living blueprint' podcasts as they've really helped me find freedom from my anxiety. You can find them online and you don't need to pay. "

There were times where we had to read a book out loud in class and I could literally see my heart beating through my sweatshirt I was so panicked. nExercise, like everyone is saying it's really good for you. I am 27 now and I work out six days a week. It helps. I would also suggest CBT or exposure therapy. I feel like you need a human being to be able to talk to about this.nAlso, even though you are a male and  this may be a less likely culprit, I would highly suggest you get your thyroid checked. Look into it, because I have HYPOthyroid and it caused me extreme anxiety and even OCD when I was unmedicated. This could also explain why you are struggling with your weight.nAlso, there is a strong link between gut health and anxiety. Studies have suggested that taking a high value probiotic and Can decrease anxiety. 95% of our serotonin is produced in our gut! Healthy diet is imperative as well.nAnd meditation and affirmations in the morning I think would be of great value for you. nI know this is a lot.

Social anxiety makes it feel like all attention is on you. I felt like everyone in the lunch room was looking at me and judging me for having no friends, thinking that I was a loser. nnI had no choice but to sit by myself in the corner of the cafeteria.nIt felt like people were thinking the worst of me the entire time. nnThe best way to weaken the hold social anxiety has on your life, is to do the things you avoid because of it. This is one of the most helpful things I've gotten out of therapy. It's obvious, but you may not realize how many little things you avoid or do differently when you're not mindful of them. nnAnother thing that helps me is to remind myself that nobody really gives a fuck. They may see you sitting alone in the lunch room. They may judge you for a loner. But 20 seconds later, they're thinking about something else. They've gone back to their own lives. And even if they do judge you negatively, so what? Their thoughts are their problem.nnIt also helps to say things to yourself like, ""I feel anxious"" or ""I feel nervous"". ""I feel afraid"". This removes the feeling that the anxiety is a part of you. Instead it becomes more of something that is separate, and you can look at it more logically and rationally. nnnn "
1302,"throwawayLastStraw","comment","","I think seeing a therapist could help a lot. I've been in therapy for 2 years, and it's made me way happier and transformed my ability to relate to people and maintain friendships for the better. It used to be on weekends I would have panic attacks because I was so worried about whether people didnt like me or because I didnt have plans or I was overthinking something someone had said. I come off as extroverted and sociable, so most people wouldnt have guessed how anxious I was, but it was causing me a lot of pain, and causing me to not be open to new friendships, or drive wedges in existing friendships. I wish I had gone into therapy to help me with my social anxiety sooner. nnAs for making friends, I'm not sure whether you are in high school or college at your age, so my advice might depend on that. High school is just rough no matter what you do sometimes. However in college, despite being extremely unpopular in high school, I had no problem making many rewarding friendships through joining clubs and going to events. Clubs typically throw events and parties and invite all members, and usually everyone in a club wants to get to know each other and be super nice. You are almost signing up for a friend group in and of itself if you find the right club that's filled with good people. Sometimes it takes a while to find a club that's a good fit, but it definitely pays off when you do. I'm sure high school clubs can be the same way. I did have some luck with that when I was in high school, but I went to such a small high school there were only like 3 people in every club, and only 8 clubs to choose from (which typically had the same 3 people in them as all the other clubs).

1312,"throwawayLastStraw","comment","","Unfortunately you may need to tell your mother in order to see a therapist, as I assume you are on her medical insurance, and therapy can be expensive. There may be other options, however. I would try and speak to a counselor at your school about your interest in therapy if it is really important to go to one without telling your mother. There are also resources online that you can use more privately. They are not the same as going to a therapist, but may help if you cant access one right now. However if I were you I would try telling your mother about your desire to see a therapist. I dont know the details of your relationship with her, but even if she gives you shit about it or isnt the most supportuve, as long as she helps you pay for therapy it doesnt matter, because you will be getting the help you need. nnI'm glad the clubs are going well!nnOpening up is hard, but it starts with sharing things about yourself. Even small things like your favorite movie, or your opinions on various things. That will happen in time, and you can build up to bigger things to share about yourself. Dont worry too much about getting people to like you by being funny or interesting. At the end of the day people care more about how you make them feel--like if you made them feel listened to and cared about--than whatever it is you say exactly. I used to try to be super funny and tell entertaining and interesting stories to make people like me, and I noticed that while it helped me make friends quickly at first, over time it didnt actually help me much in maintaining friendships. People dont really want to have a friend who is always performing for them, they just want someone to be trustworthy and supportive. Just focus on being kind and things will work out. "
1335,"RosaJess","comment","","I completely agree. I only recently realized that I have some social anxiety. I don't consider myself a socially awkward person, but because of my bad experiences in elementary and high school and some traumatic experiences at home, I developed low self esteem and abandonment issues, anxiety and bouts of depression. I have gone through a lot. I am living in Canada on my own, moved here from Prague. It's been incredibly difficult and after visiting home I found out my dad is a gambler and played away all his (and my) money. So now I have to do everything on my own, at 21, and it's tough. But, therapy, medication, yoga, exercise and writing is what helps me. I am always worried that people are gonna judge me or leave me, that I will be forever alone and sad, now I know it's fear of abandonment that spilled from my dad to my other relationships. Life can be really really really shitty, but I find that self care is the most important, and so are people. If you're having issues connecting with people, I do too, try taking some time for yourself and figure out why and how you're struggling. It helped me. I know why and how, now the next step is how to change it. Bad thoughts will creep in, don't fight them, listen to them, why they are there and realize it might just be a pattern of thought that's unhelpful. But it's not the truth. Meditation and mindfulness helps. And dance. And cooking. And writing."
1338,"botsautopiloot","comment","","It might not be for you, but you could try bodybuilding. It has so many benefits for social anxiety and depression, I suggest it a lot here.nnIt helps with depression because bodybuilding is a lifestyle, it's something that will be relevant in every day and will make your days a lot more fun if you enjoy it. You can read about bodybuilding related stuff for hundreds of hours, there is so much to know about nutrution and working out and how your body works. You have to switch to a healthy lifestyle, this can give you a boost in confidence and energy by itself, I used to just be in my room 24/7 and eat trash all day and this made me depressed as shit. You get out of the house too for about 5-10 hours a week, and you get to work on your social anxiety as well by doing that. If you like cooking, you can get really creative with healthy recipes, if you want to learn how to cook this is perfect as well, you got 2 new hobby's at once and you have some stuff to talk about with other people :)nnFor social anxiety it has tons of benefits as well. It might sound weird but it's true that muscular people often get treated with more respect than regular people. People will generally be nicer and more interested in talking with you. During the bodybuilding process you'll gain confidence as well and your social anxiety could start to fade away just from that.nnI personally have been depressed for 3 years (19 now), but 1 year into this lifestyle I can say I'm really looking forward to the rest of my life and my depression is nearly gone. It could be worth a try:)"

Yeah I know exactly what you mean I understand we are only here once and we have got to make the most of life because once we are gone we are gone it's just my SA has held me back from achieving what I want to achieve and travel the world because I feel I can't work so I can't fund me travelling the world.

I've actually developed some awful IBS and can never fully evacuate my bowels now because of this, it is absolutely awful. The mind is such a powerful thing. I had no idea your own fears and thoughts could actually end up harming you. My only hope now is go through ""gut-directed"" clinical hypnosis, which supposedly is scientifically proven to reduce IBS symptoms, and I know I definitely need some counseling for the underlying anxiety and self sabotaging thoughts.

For a little background, this past March I had a psychotic break in which I was hospitalized for some times and diagnosed with a variety of conditions, SA included. So after that I was drugged up on five different medications. I started a new job and missed several weeks due to relapsing and being put back in the hospital. After I returned I tried my absolute hardest to mesh back into the environment but I made multiple stupid mistakes many of which I attribute to my brain being absolute mush from how drugged I was. So after they let me go I was absolutely devastated especially because I've always had a very strong work ethic and I never saw myself as a person who would be fired. I can still picture my boss saying they ""tried everything"" with me which made me feel like a complete idiot. nSo as of now I am still unemployed. My SA is only worsening as the weeks go by. I've had four different interviews, and two stages (working interviews) and managed to fuck up every single one. I get so nervous I can't think straight and can hardly retain information for more than five seconds because my brain is so frazzled. I live on an island and my hometown is 15 miles away. I refuse to even consider jobs within a ten mile radius of there because I get so freaked out seeing people I know, or worse people from my old job. nAt this point I've given up even looking for jobs. I feel like such an incapable idiot, a failure. I see people I know working jobs who I know to be far less intelligent than me and it pains me I'm so held back by my SA. "

Most of my doctor's appointments get canceled because I either get too anxious to go or when I do go, I'm too nervous to tell her the truth about how bad it is for me.nI've been on 3 different antidepressants and anti anxiety medications this year.  I probably would be too anxious to even go to the doctor to diagnose the anxiety to get any benefits and even if I did, like I said, I'm never able to actually open up about how bad I feel every day. nThe only time I leave the house is to go to work and I had to cut down to 3 ten hour days because I'm a very nervous driver, which had caused 3 accidents because my anxiety gets worse when driving.nI haven't shopped for my groceries in a store in over a year.

1575,"ThePunisher2442","comment","","I used to have TERRIBLE acne when I was 15 and 16. I had blood filled cysts on my face, including a giant bubble on my right jaw that has permanently scarred my skin and prevented facial hair from growing properly in that spot. It was incredibly painful too, and I would get these random bursts of excruciating pain all throughout my face that sometimes required me to leave school because of how severe it was. My face basically looked like an exotic pizza. It was humiliating and very difficult to deal with on a daily basis.nnI started taking accutane in January of 2013 and took it through May of that year. There are some nasty side effects, but it worked wonders. It actually made my acne worse at first, but in the long run it cleared my face almost completely. I should also mention that I was getting weekly needle injections in my fucking face to reduce the swelling of all my cysts and pustules. They hurt like a motherfucker but they definitely helped. I also have social anxiety so I know exactly what you're going through. I'm 20 now and haven't had any acne problems since I was 16, although I do have fairly obvious facial scarring from all the acne, most noticeable on my forehead. I'd gladly take them over the acne itself, however, so it's a good trade off. I recommend checking out accutane. Like I said, there are some potentially bad side effects, so ask your doctor any questions or share concerns you may have about it. Acne sucks, but it's not permanent. Good luck my friend "
1582,"Not_So_Tiny_Tim","comment","","If I’m being honest I didn’t cope well for the first 3 years. I was depressed and once I graduated high school (a year after my injury) I pretty much isolated myself and avoided all interactions with strangers. I think it didn’t help that the pain and struggle seemed never-ending. In January when I decided to amputate my whole outlook on life changed. I finally had a set date for my suffering to end. That perked me up immensely. And even after the surgery I experienced no regret, only joy. Accepting that I’m gonna be disabled forever but that doesn’t mean my life is over helped a lot too. Now it’s unlikely that your story is gonna end like mine so you have to find a different way of being happy. You DO have to try to make the most of your situation. For now you are on crutches with no certain end date. You are still a living breathing person and you should still do things that bring you joy. If, like me, all the things that make you happy are physical you have to find new things! Since I’m a few weeks away from my prosthesis I’ve been home constantly. I’ve just knitted my first complete scarf and I’m so proud of it. You need hobbies.  Now if your therapists/doctors aren’t listening to you go to new doctors. If you really don’t need surgery then go to a pain management doctor. PM me and we can talk more! "
1585,"spacecadette007","comment","","Hey :) I can relate to a lot of what you said.  For the last 4 years or so (I'm 18, just started uni this year) I've gotten more and more shy, and also more socially isolated.  Towards the end of high school I realized everyone had been making friends and growing as people this whole time, and I had been stuck, being the same socially anxious and inhibited person.  Not making friends definitely stunted my growth, in term of developing social skills.  Now that I'm in uni, I still feel really far behind other people my age.  And not being confident and having good social skills makes it really difficult to make friends in uni.  But what I have been trying to do is just accept that I'm a bit behind and I just need to keep trying to grow and improve everyday.  Just remeber, you haven't ""lost all chances of being likable"", your just not feeling confident at the moment, and your behind on social development.  But it's okay, if you keep your head up and commit to improving, things will eventually get better.  nnAlso, sometimes therapy can be a good idea if you need guidance and support.  nnHope things improve for you!

1588,"grabasnack","comment","","Yeah, almost always when someone is 1-on-1 with me. I remember especially well how uncomfortable my psychologist was around me.

1609,"IanTannir","comment","","&gt;Fuck high school.nnAmen brother. I am in college and still have vivid memories of how god awful high school was. My social anxiety was so severe I was afraid to get in line in the cafeteria (I only ate in the cafeteria twice in 4 years). Having virtually no friends and going through the daily pain of seeing people who *used* to be my friends having a relatively good time was beyond depressing. nnI might be wrong in my diagnosis but you're acting like ""a narcisstic asshole"" because you're trying to fit in. If you're out of your comfort zone doing what you're doing now then try to find some niche that's better for you, both socially and mentally. But don't do what I did, going ""full on anti-social"".

That was not a way I used be, and my friends were friend with me unchanged self. nnDon't try too hard to change it; no matter who you are, there will be always a good chunk of friends, girls and guys, who want to be friend with. Even if you are mildly awkward, there will be always several people who would match with you well.

1640,"HipsterWhoMissedOut","comment","","I got the same task from my psychologist. I’ve been procrastinating on doing that but my advice is to note down every time you want to say something simple but can’t. For example, every time I get off the bus I want to say “good night” or “thank you” to the bus driver but I can’t bring myself to do it. So that’s something I can write down.

I didn't really have anything like that, it didn't help that I was significantly poorer than my peers. My parents managed to get me into a school in an affluent area, it wasn't private but there was a huge social class divide. nnI have considered talking to a councillor, but I just never get round to it. I was in hospital last year for an unrelated issue (appendix rupture) but a nurse noticed I was very depressed and tried to get me to open up. I spoke to her a little bit and she gave me instructions on how to get counselling through the NHS but the whole thing just sounds too much. My college has a therapist but I've heard that she's very booked up and it can take 3 months or more to be seen, and you often just get referred by here to one of her colleuges who works for the local council :/ I feel like the waiting would just make my anxiety worse in the long run."

The ladies working for him realised I had trouble with anxiety on the phone and told me that no one expects you to be very formal on the phone, no matter what working environment.

You can tell them ...""sorry about this, I haven't been working here long and am still getting used to the controls"" if you make any mistake.

Just like you, I wasn't always like this, I was a shy child and it was hard for me to talk to strangers and make friends. Because of this, I got bullied a lot in school and I didn't have a good situation at home either. My father was/is an abusive alcoholic piece of trash and made my life a living hell whenever he was home. And my mother could't stop him because she was affraid, he would hit her whenever she said something that he wasn't agreeing with.nnIn my first years as a teenager, I was actually doing pretty good, somehow. I loved going out with friends, socializing, meeting new people, go shopping, all the normal things teenagers do. And one day, out of nowhere, after ending a bad relationship (that rised my stress levels through the roof), I find myself in front of the class (in high school), in a middle of a presentation, having a full blown panic attack. I was shaking so bad that I couldn't even read from my paper, I had to run from class because I didn't know what was happening to me. And that was how it all started. After that day, I became so anxious when it comes to social situations that even ""normal""/easy things from day to day are extremely difficult for me to do, like: talking over the phone with people I don't know, talking to the cashiers, speaking in front of a crowd, participating in group activities, talking to strangers, going to social events, damn, even walking in public it's a struggle. Sometimes I feel like I'm an alien that is trying to ""blend"" in with the people. Especially when I am talking to someone I'm not familiar with, I stutter, my mind goes blank, I forget what things are called, I don't know what to do with my hands, so I will just make so many gestures that it looks like we're talking different languages, my face would go red sometimes, but it's not that obvious (thanks to make up) and so on. I am trying SO HARD to maintain a ""normal"" appearence (with all the shaking, hyperventialting, muscle spasms and body movement) that I feel like I just can't take it anymore. It's so tiring and I feel like all my energy gets drain just for that 10-15 minutes conversation. I feel like I don't fit in anywhere and I am just a burden for people around me. I was not able to go to college, I have berely finished high school, just like you, with a lot of absences and struggling to learn between my overwhelming emotions. Now I am 25 and I am still struggling just as much, not being able to maintain a job and having done nothing with my life. I feel awful almost everyday because I am really going through this alone. nnYou are lucky enough to have your parents by your side, so there may still be hope for you. They already know what you are going through and they understand, have you tried talking to them about getting professional help? Like going to therapy, it may really help you in time."
1863,"UnKn0wN31337","comment","","I've been suspecting myself of social anxiety/awkwardness as far as I was 12 when I couldn't interact with an classmate who I wanted to be friends with. I was scared to do or say something infront of my class because I was getting bullied before and my parents decided to homeschool me without even asking me, which only worsened my social anxiety due to little to none social interactions and as of result, I created drama with an classmate few times and I still really feel bad about that even today.nnMy family also never let me go outside at the time so I was really isolated from social for no reason without any way to improve my social skills like any normal person. They even made fun of me of how I apparently can't go to stores to buy food, etc when they were the ones who were really toxic and abusive at me and even banned me from going outside because I apparently have no social skills.nnI've been really working hard on my social anxiety/awkwardness and loneliness since 2015, when I finally convinced my parents to let me go outside after so long time and I've been just exposing myself since then and I heavily improved myself alot that much without therapy/meds. nnI have little to none social anxiety online, in outside, in stores, etc that much today, but in college it's still pretty bad, it's nearly ending of second year and I still haven't really made any friends and I rarely speak unless really needed to do so and it's really difficult to study by yourself completely. I tried to make friends since the very first days and all I got was getting bullied by few toxic groupmates who literally are the worst students in my group. I've been skipping for an month now (!!) because of getting sick for first 2 weeks and then depression really got bad again with nightmares making me feel bad for another 1-2 weeks. nnI probably fucked up hard this time and I can't get myself to ask this one groupmate who's kinda fine to me about what I've missed, what do I need to do and if I was being discussed. It's pure awful and exams are coming in like 2 weeks aswell and I still haven't even started to prepare either. Ugh... I wish the whole April (and my whole life) was just one long nightmare and that I wake up right now.nn"

Still, what's the worst they can do, send you a dismissive email? Not respond at all? nnDoes your uni have some sort of counselor for planning out your university years?

1873,"UnderGroundK","comment","","Hey, I just saw your reply, hope you are feeling better since the last time you posted. Honestly, I can't guarantee you that therapy would definitely work, because I couldn't afford it, just like you said, it's so expensive. But if I could, I would give it a try. Just like you, right now I'm thinking ""how can anyone help me get over this when I know there's nothing to freak out about, yet my body still goes crazy when I have to interact with people?"" Because I really feel like what my body goes through in those moments of panic, it's something I am not in control of. Trust me, I tried to calm myself down, I tried telling myself that my fear is irrational and that nothing bad/out of the ordinary is happening to me, I KNOW that, yet still, my body does his ""I am about to die"" thing. It's so frustrating! nnSo my reason for wanting to try and give you advice to do so (therapy), is because, everybody I talked to, that suffers with anxiety said that it's the only way to get help and feel like a normal human being again. It doesn't work like a miracle, you have to put in a lot of work too, push yourself to do some things, but if it actually works, I guess it's worth it. So, talk to your folks, if they can afford it, please, give it a try! I would be so happy to see you post here after a while, telling me/us that you are doing better. It'll give me some hope at least. nnI wish you good luck and remeber that you are not alone! "
1874,"Anoobis94","comment","","I dont know what jobs did you do, but why was it required for you to be more extraveted and assertive? Is it possible to look for a job which doesnt require those things? But my best advice for you, before you start working somewhere, if you have luxury of being unemployed ofc, make an appointment with a doctor and tell him everything. I am 24 year old and changed 6 different jobs, and before any job I tell myself ""ok I have experience with these things, it's gonna be better"", but its getting worse every time, and I had enough, and so should you."
1902,"evergrace96","comment","","I mean that you need other ways to cure social anxiety, like medication, meditation, nofap, exercise and generally other self-improvement methods. I am social anxious person from the age of 13 and i have been socializing with many people all these years. Now i am 22 , male nurse student and i am forced to socialize with patients and other female nurses students, but social anxiety still skyrockets. Today i was literally shaking for no reason when i was talking with a group of girls. You don't cure social anxiety by socializing, it can't be treated with homeopathy. At least from my experience."
1907,"PSITYW","comment","","Appreciate the response. :)nnIt sounds like it's worked amazing for you, that's awesome.nnYeah, mentally I do alright.  I usually just ignore the physical stuff, until I stutter accidentally, or start noticing my sweat, or feel my heart beating out of my chest.  Then it's a little harder to ignore then lol.  Sounds like I need to pay a visit to my doctor."

Very often, I did not speak the local language, When I did, I was bullied because I was always the new kid.

1938,"lana0007","comment","","I went to a therapist for the first time last summer. She was an extrovert and I could tell she could not relate to my anxiety. After that I had a hard time being honest and opening up about basically any of my struggles. So my first piece of advice is: has your therapist worked with patients with anxiety before? Does your therapist have a good amount of empathetic understanding of the experiences people like us go through? If they have the experience and you feel comfortable then maybe write down what you need to talk about and then go for it. If they don’t help out or have a negative reaction, then you aren’t a good match. "
1939,"LauraKathryn95","comment","","I always told my therapist that I felt like a different person when I was drunk, more confident and able to walk up to people and start a conversation. nnShe told me that alcohol doesn’t actually change your personality it just lowers your inhibitions, which makes me think, is the drunk version of me the repressed (and slightly louder) version of myself? nnI kind of feel like social anxiety has made me lose my personality, but I always feel like it comes back when I’m drunk? "
1965,"520mile","comment","","I have Asperger’s too and I struggle with a lot of the same things as you do. I’m trying my best to socialize better, and to do that some things I started doing (based on what my therapist told me) are:nn- Adjusting your body language. Try to appear more relaxed (untensed shoulders, don’t guard yourself with your things...) so that others find you easier to talk to. It may help you BE more relaxed (fake it til you make it I guess)nn- Really focus on listening (but not to the point where it’s creepy)! When listening to someone you might get an idea on how to contribute to the conversation.nnThese aren’t “cure-alls” of course, but just things to help you be more comfortable/patient. Hope this helps!!"
1973,"jean0_","comment","","I totally relate to this. I'm exactly the same, I was shy growing up but it was never really an issue until like puberty when I started getting super anxious and self conscious, and I guess I never really grew out of it. I have the same anxiety that I've missed out on so much of life due to being afraid of people. And yeah I also love the idea of meeting new people but I've always just been so uncomfortable around others, because I'm afraid they'll think I'm weird or rude for being so quiet.nnLoneliness sucks and I spent the first couple of years of college hoping I would make some good friends but barely made any. For the longest time I felt hopeless, that I would be stuck with SA destroying my life forever, and I was really depressed for a months straight last semester. But I was fortunate enough to find somebody who I felt comfortable opening up to, who helped me with scheduling appointments and stuff like that. But most importantly she helped me realize that it wasn't all hopeless and helped me feel confident that I could get better. nnMedication is helpful for a lot of people but from what I've heard therapy is the most effective. I would recommend trying to find someone in your life who can help you get yourself help, because unfortunately social anxiety is not something that you will just grow out of, but you will definitely overcome it if you try. If you don't have any friends you feel comfortable telling, you could try a parent or your doctor. Either way you'll be surprised; even if you don't feel close, most people are much more understanding than you may think. You can fight it alone but having emotional support has honestly been the single most important thing for me, especially dealing with depression as well.nnIf you want to talk feel free to message me, I can totally understand what you're going throughn"
1987,"pinkie7_","comment","","It was a slow process tbh but I’ll happily give you the deets 😌nnI started studying a new course in university and in Germany where I live there are normal universities like in the US and universities that are similar to colleges/schools. Soo it’s not anonymous and you do group work and talk to many different people. Most of the people I met there are 23-30, quite grown up and really nice and friendly. This really helped. But honestly I came to realise that 90% of the people are friendly, you’ll find cool people too haha.nnPractice makes perfect. I had to read a paper called ”Toward a Unifying theory of behavioral change“ by Albert Bandura, one of the most famous psychologists. This paper changed my mind. It’s on self-efficacy and I highly recommend you to read it, too. It made me realise that the others aren’t better than me, it’s ME that’s in my way. My way of thinking has been stopping me. It’s constructed, it feels very real but it isn’t. My thoughts (about myself) weren’t true. It’s similar to disgust. I personally am disgusted by certain insects others let on their hands. Why am I even disgusted then? It’s constructed too, they’re not objectively disgusting. This made me realise I’ll have to change my way of thinking in order to stop my anxiety. Bandura refers to snake phobics in said paper but I guess it holds true for us too :) ohh I don’t know if you’re a student so I’ll give you some tips on reading a paper efficiently: don’t read the mathematical part. Unless you’re interested in understanding it, it’s complicated and they’ll explain what it means in other parts of their paper. Read the abstract, maybe the introduction and then the discussion. You may want to read Bandura‘s whole paper tho as it’s more of a summary than a study.nnMoreover, I read so many papers on social anxiety in general using google scholar and my university‘s access to specialised literature. I read how social anxiety is defined in modern psychology. They say it’s a fear of rejection. But what really happens when you get rejected? Nothing happens. Try and ask people some really dumb shit like ”what’s the name of the queen again?“ and they won’t be rude. They either won’t know either or happily tell you the answer. And you’ll notice you didn’t die. Feelings pass and feelings can’t kill you. nnI also read up on the fight/flight/freeze response. How does it work? What happens in your body? What exactly happens in the brain? Your adrenal cortex and sympathetic nervous system are trying to defend you from danger but there isn’t any danger. nnI read studies that found social anxiety is fueled and maintained by rumination. If I now find myself ruminating about sth I could’ve done better, I try to stop thinking about it. I don’t judge myself for these thoughts, I accept them. I know that this is what has kept my social anxiety alive and that’s why I want to stop them. Read up on other factors of social anxiety. It’s fun reading these tbh, these scientists are really spending their LIFETIME to gather knowledge on us and write as if they wrote about animals. It makes it sound really adorable. Learn about neuropsychology in general, it gave me sooo much love for humans. Humans really are pure. There are people out there who are so curious about social anxiety they actually do research on it. Isn’t that sweet? They’re curious like a child. Here I am, writing to a total stranger how I got better. Isn’t this really kind? I don’t want to brag or sth but this is how humans are. Adorable. Several people upvoted my post saying I got better. Again, adorable.nnAnother thing that helped me is trying to stop judging others and seriously understand where they’re coming from. Chances are you’ll realise they’re very similar to you. And humans really are sweet. Well, most of them haha. Nobody knows what they do but here we are on a planet that revolves around a fireball. Maybe you want to read Nietzsche on amor fati. Reading about it on the internet or watching a video on YouTube should suffice.nnAdditionally, I watched others‘ presentations. I watched these gorgeous people turn red and they were so nervous, too. What for? They too are either afraid of rejection or getting poor grades. This is so pure, again. I didn’t even think of thinking a single bad thing about them, yet they were afraid of others‘ judgements. They all nailed it. Some girl asked the audience a question, nobody answered for like 3 seconds. We didn’t have the chance to think it through, it was a difficult task and our brains aren’t that fast. It’s interesting haha. She got nervous and immediately explained it herself. I found this really sweet and it made me like her even more. I wouldn’t have thought she would get nervous, she always seems so confident. Watching others, not in a creepy stalking way but watching them to understand them makes you love most people. How could you fear something you love?nnBecome a gentle observer of yourself. You’ll have to feel all the feels. You’ll have to feel as if you’re going to die and realise you won’t. Take care of yourself and time to rest up. I‘m not anxiety-free but I now love to push through it. It really gets better and it’s worth it. I was clinically depressed just 6 months ago.. but life is great. You can really do whatever tf you want, how cool is that? As hackneyed as it sounds but really put yourself out there. Get hurt, get anxious and get over it, you’ll be fine. Did I mention we‘re living on a planet that revolves around a freaking fireball and that has a moon that moves the oceans? What’s life really. I guess science really gives me a love for life haha. Allow yourself to feel what you’re feeling without judgment. nnOhh and please only read scientific papers, not this Freud and Jung psychoanalytical bs. I study psychology and there are many reasons this isn’t taught anymorennEdit: you won’t have to talk much about yourself if you’re too afraid in the beginning. Try and actively listen. Ask questions. To understand others, not to impress or anything. Get to know them. Everyone loves people who can listen. Don’t try to think of what to reply, just listen. Just be a decent person and you’ll be fine."
1990,"pinkie7_","comment","","Glad you asked 😌 they do have some valuable ideas and it can help some people. Much of what especially Freud said was tested with many many people and they came to the conclusion that it’s wrong. Some of his concepts are good tho and you really have to appreciate that he was one of the first people who were interested in disorders instead of deploring them. My professors would fight me on this one, they use pretty strong language when it comes to Freud haha. I guess they don’t always want to be associated with couches.nnIn modern psychology scientists work like this: they word a hypothesis which must be able to be disproved. It has to be really simple, ”if a then b follows“. They read lots of literature and other studies on their topic. They form a test with many items to make sure they get the correct result. They often don’t do the tests face to face as to avoid people being dishonest. People tend to lie when they talk about uncomfortable things so they promise anonymity. They do lots of maths to check if it was a coincidence. They do more maths and check how likely it is that they were wrong because the sample was too small etc. Theoretically for it to be scientifically proven they’d have to ask every person on the planet. This is obviously too much effort so they check how likely it is that they were wrong and it’s only correct until a study shows the opposite. The tests they use have been approved many times and always turned out to be correct. The results need to be objective, independent from the person who collected the data, reproducible and valid. If this really interests you, you could read Popper for example. nnHere’s what Freud did: he listened to one person, he admitted he sometimes napped during the session, and said ”x holds true for everyone“. He also had a friend whose name I forgot and this friend told him about clients he was seeing. So Freud had the confidence to analyse these people too. Also, it’s way too complex. It’s hard to prove it wrong because Freud always has alternatives. It always seems to make sense because they’re circular and can’t be proven wrong. Like he says if x happens, then y follows or maybe sometimes z or a does. nnI heard that psychoanalysis is fairly successful though. I guess there are other variables that play a role in the success like the time it takes (usually years) so it might better by itself. They call this confounding variable and in studies you try to get rid of all of them. But it doesn’t really make sense: if you focus on your past a lot and talk about it 1-3x a week, you strengthen those neuron bonds. The more you think about sth, the stronger these neurons get. This is scientifically proven. So the logical thing to happen is that the person enhances the behaviour they want to treat. nnI hope this helps, in short what bothers them is that they didn’t use scientific methods."

But my problem didn't stop there. Social situations don't bother me very much. I pretty much stick to myself and say something only when I have things to add to the subject or someone asks me something. And I don't mind listening to other people's stories. But there ALWAYS has to be that ONE PERSON! The ""clown"" (I call them), that one person that lives to be the center of attention. That one person that makes fun of everyone and everything just to get attention. But if they see a quiet person, they feel like they hit the jack pot. You will definitely be their subject of torture for the rest of the event/trip/party. It's like having an invisible magnet that pulls them towards you.

2079,"lana0007","comment","","I’m in the same boat and I believe in the same thing about shame and anxiety, it’s like we are caught in this awful loop shaming ourselves over and over again. My mom shamed me for my sexuality at a young age. Kids self soothe when they are younger but she would cry and call the doctor whenever she saw or caught me doing it. Because she called the doctor I thought I was sick, because that’s an appropriate connection to make when you’re like 5/6. So I grew up thinking my sexuality was actually a mental illness that my mom was ashamed I had. She would occasionally assure me I was normal, but then still get angry at me and upset in ways that didn’t appropriately match up with my actions. It wasn’t until I was like 14 that I fully understood and accepted what had happened, but by that time the damage was done, my sexuality was tied to an intense shame and belief that I was abnormal and deeply wrong in my actions."

2109,"damienhh","comment","","I don't know if sexuality plays as much of a role in this as gender roles do. Gender conformity issues are hard, I experience them often as a gay-perceived transgender man. It sucks that LGBT people live in a society where we experience such high levels of minority stress, even if we aren't being actively discriminated against. Fear is always there. Dressing in boring ways make me feel less anxious, for one. Another way I have seen other feminine men combat scrutiny is through being sarcastic. Instead of sarcasm I am often very blunt and banal, although that doesn't help with making friends all that much. We should both see a therapist or something. Too bad to do that I need to get a new PCP with involves phone calling, one of my biggest fears. I kind of feel that alter ego thing, too. It's easier for me to lie about my interests and be inauthentic than to be authentic and share my actual feelings and thoughts. I will almost always do that, even in ways that make no sense at all, out of anxiety. Almost like an alter ego, but more spontaneous.nnOne way I have gotten jobs is by seeking out bad yelp reviews and finding places that I hope have a low bar for entry. That hasn't worked out too great for me so far, but I did work for a fabric store for a little while.  I'm 22, by the way."
2122,"Benjoboss93","comment","","I feel you bro. My gf broke up with me for the same reasons. I never wanted to go to concerts or to see her friends because I was always too anxious. Finally she kind of gave up and I got super depressed for a while. That was probably 5 years ago though. I would say to just try and not blame her, she probably tried to make it work but you're just going through some shit right now which made it hard. I'm now with a different girl who also has some serious anxiety too and it is completely different. Shes amazing. We really support and love each other and work through things like SA together. I would suggest getting some therapy and really trying to tackle your SA without it becoming something you're ashamed of. Its fixable you just have to work though it. You might even be able to get back together with her but it's most likely not even worth it. Trust me theres always someone else who can make you equally or more happy. "

2155,"duskyblue3731","comment","","I've never been diagnosed with anything, mostly because I know I'm not emotionally unstable and I don't have any uncontrollable behaviors. If your confident that social anxiety is the only thing you're dealing with, I'd hold off on the therapist. I'm saying that because it's very common these days to have this social problem and slapping a diagnosis on it won't help to solve your issue, plus therapists can be pretty expensive and many social anxiety issues can be solved on your own. A lot of times, you can grow out of it, and a lot of times you just need to break out of old habits. Nothing wrong with therapy, but it's a fairly mild issue and as long as you don't turn to drugs or alcohol to cope, you can break out of it with a lot of persistence and determination. Don't forget, you always have us if you're struggling for answers. :)"
2156,"prettyloathsome","comment","","I would grab my teenage self by the shoulders and tell her not to switch to online schooling and to not avoid all the people who tell her they want to be her friend, because it will lead to a state of isolation that she'll get used to over the years and therefore become nearly impossible to get out of. Aside from a few dates, one boyfriend, and a short period of friendship with a co-worker that I managed to fuck up, I've had no meaningful relationships for 11 years.  I feel that I've gotten to the point where being a loner is simply my fate because I've gone so long without anyone aside from family that the idea of being close with other people, having friends and going out with them, has become unnatural to me. The only possible solution is intensive therapy, which of course is in direct conflict with my hardwired instinct to withdraw that caused my problem in the first place.nnSo, basically, I would tell my teenage self to do the opposite of everything she thinks she should do."
2187,"crippling_happiness","comment","","First of all you’re very brave to sum up everything that is bothering you and post it on here! It’s not always easy admitting to yourself and others that you’re stuck, but it’s the first step towards getting help! :) nnI‘m 18 and I‘ve been dealing with depression and (social and generalized) anxiety ever since I can remember, so I can see a lot of myself in what you’re saying. There are ways to get better, though, and you are not your fear! It’s a part of you, but it does not define you &lt;3 nnIt takes courage to work through all those things and some of them you might have been bottling up for so long you don’t even realize they are causing you distress. You will break down in tears and, at times, question your own capability, but it’s so worth it. nnImagine the life you could be leading if your worries weren’t constantly holding you back. And that’s not just a motivational quote in front of a pretty landscape, it’s a real possibility.nnI don’t know you well enough to give you any concrete advice, but I strongly suggest you get professional help. No one can expect of you to go on this journey all alone and there are people out there who know how to assist you! Try and talk to your doctor about it and he will most likely refer you to a psychologist/therapist and prescribe you medication if necessary :)nnMy inbox is always open if you ever need to talk &lt;3"
2188,"ThePunisher2442","comment","","Hmm. Yes and no. It didn’t affect the way I treated her, but it did make me self conscious when I was in public with her, which made me feel really selfish and guilty. I knew she was attractive and that’s all that should’ve mattered to me yet I let the idea of other people thinking she wasn’t affect me. It made me less willing to go out with her which was very bad, but that didn’t really contribute to the downfall of our relationship. It was mainly her insane parents who constantly tried to control her, but that’s a whole other story lol "
2209,"TrueOptimism","comment","","I haven’t been diagnosed either, but social anxiety is the fear of social situations, or, more specifically, the fear of being judged or viewed negatively by other people which causes feelings of  inadequacy, inferiority, self-consciousness, embarrassment, humiliation, and depression.nnFrom what you said, I’d say you probably have social anxiety"
2211,"TrueOptimism","comment","","I might consider therapy later on, but I just don’t feel ready for it yet. I’ve had it for about 3 years but didn’t notice it until a few months ago. i had the same class for grade 6 &amp; 7 so in grade 8,  being in a new class without any friends made my anxiety a lot worse, which is when I noticed that the anxiety I felt probably isn’t normal."
2219,"lylli97","comment","","It’s always good to get an official diagnosis of course but I’m self diagnosed cuz ik myself better than any doctor could anyway. Tho I might bring it up the next time I see my family doctor. Lots of ppl have very apparent SA and aren’t properly diagnosed. nnI’m just like you, I can go to a shopping mall and grocery store, etc with no problem. I actually work in NYC so I’m around and interacting w ppl daily. However like you mentioned about the small pizza shop I’d think the same things n get self conscious. So we both are still socially anxious, just about certain things. nnWhat I mean by socially anxious introvert is that I am both an introvert and have social anxiety. Most ppl think all introverts have SA disorder but that’s simply not true (I used to think that). Being introverted can just mean you like being by yourself or one/two other ppl because you feel more at peace, not cuz a large group of ppl makes you anxious. Introverts can deal with social interaction but are thought to run out of “social battery” after prolonged interaction w others. On the other hand, ppl with SA tend to have a strong desire to be more social but their condition prevents them and drives them to be introverted.nnHope I explained it well enough for you n I have no problem answering more questions :) "
2220,"many_breads","comment","","Therapy and medication. I wish I was kidding, but if you think it'll get better on its own, you'll soon be an adult with no friends. And that is a way, way harder rut to get out of. My emergency contact is 9 hours away from where I live, shit sucks.nnI don't mean to scare you or make you feel bad, but the people who tell you you aren't trying hard enough to make friends and that you just have to put yourself out there are huge fucking assholes. SAD means that sometimes you really do need medication to do those things, don't beat yourself up about it.

At least, my anxiety is so physical (heart palpitations, tearing up, etc) that I can be totally mentally aware that none of it is real, but still want to crawl in a hole and cry. Meds changed the fucking game for me. nnI know people are so wary about medication, especially since SAD in particular comes off as ""you just aren't trying enough, it's all about your mental space, and so on.""

2285,"OpTicMixwell","comment","","Depends on the medication. nn[SSRIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor) are hit or miss. If they work, you'll be less anxious but it won't really feel like anything. You'll just be less anxious.nn[Benzodiazepines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) are the strongest anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) drugs. They massively reduce your anxiety, sedate you, relax your muscles, and you won't be anxious on the right dose. It's like you can't even understand anxiety in the moment. The problem with benzos, especially the fast acting ones like xanax, is that they are highly addictive and dangerous. Withdraws can kill you, overdosing is a legitimate risk, and your inhibitions get lowered to the point that you can make some very stupid decisions. The feeling is pretty similar to alcohol in many ways. nnIf your anxiety is really bad, maybe talk to your doctor about a weaker, longer acting benzo like klonopin or ativan. I personally think xanax should only be reserved for people with panic disorder. Benzos suck because the feeling is so relieving to someone who struggles with anxiety, but you can't just live off them the rest of your life.  "
2289,"chacoe","comment","","I'm on three psychiatric meds and they are life-changing for me.  I take Viibryd and Wellbutrin (antidepressants) and Lamictal (mood stabilizer).  I had moderate social anxiety my entire life and major depressive disorder.  Primarily I was prescribed the drugs for the depression but it took away 99% of my anxiety symptoms also.  I feel totally normal, just not scared of people.  There were only a couple minor side effects that are totally worth it to me.  Of course it may or may not work the same way for you! It can take a long time to find the right drug or drugs, if you choose to start.  I'd recommend talking to a psychiatrist about your options."
2293,"nuclearchickenman","comment","","I'm in the same situation... well except I'm a 22 year old male which I'd say is an even worse position as I'm supposed to initiate. The only thing maybe is to see a therapist for CBT or medicine if it's possible and if you feel that it is hugely affecting your life, they will help you to try to reduce your anxiety.nnUnfortunately the best way is to stray away from your comfort zone and put yourself in situations where your anxiety is high, so maybe if you see someone that you find attractive and talk to them or ask them out even. What I sometimes do is have a 'fuck it' moment where I just dismiss my thoughts and act on my impulse, although it doesn't really work all the time. Just remember quite a few men find women more attractive when you show interest.nnI'm not saying this as any other throwaway line/paragraph like 'just be yourself' or 'just fake confidence' as I find that these lines are a bit patronising. I know it's extremely difficult as I'm still currently struggling at the moment but it's not impossible, you can do it and never give up no matter how hard it gets I believe in you.nnOn a separate note, online dating is a bit shit tbh and doesn't really reflect anybody as accurately as in real life. I still use them though just in case I get lucky and find someone decent. "
2294,"chacoe","comment","","I didnt even realize I had anxiety and it wasn't just being ""shy"" until I was like, 25. I really really wish I had started medication and/or therapy when I was in high school but ...oh well.  I can only remember two side effects I've had, obviously any others were minor or went away quickly.  One was a reduction in sex drive...that's very common with SSRI's.  Viibryd and Wellbutrin are two medications with the lowest chance of that side effect, if that's a concern for you.  The other side effect is Viibryd gave me this weird...zappy... brain thing? It's hard to describe.  You have to take that pill with food and I found if I took it with dinner and then went to bed too soon afterwards, as I drifted off to sleep there would be this like electric zap in my head and my body would jerk awake.  It would happen several times as I tried to fall asleep.  I switched to taking the pill with breakfast though and that hasn't been a problem since.nnGood luck with whatever you choose to do!"

I’ve spent many of my years focusing on “school” and become a doctor or something “successful” to compensate and at least make me feel better for the isolation like “at least this time took me somewhere” but now I feel that this is not the way to live life and my efforts may not be true/for the wrong reasons. And if anything this isolation is taking me farther from my dreams and true potentials. I’ve always missed the parties, the vacations, the group events and fun, to the point I don’t even enjoy them anymore with people. It’s time for cognitive behavior therapy. I’m done feeling this way.

Focusing on school, taking more time for self care, going to the gym when I have the time. I’ve also been seeing a guy that encourages me and pulls me out of my comfort zone (in a good way), if you would’ve told me two months ago I’d be singing karaoke in front of a whole bar I’d call you crazy, yet here I am. For so long I was surrounded by people that put me discretely put me down and it took me so long to realize it.

2585,"thebirdmindreader","comment","","I was in a very similar situation last year. It was the summer before coming back to college and I started to feel really lonely and sad all the time. I thought it was from my social anxiety and that things would get better when I got back to school and was back to a regular schedule rather than just wasting away at my house. I went back and then things got worse. I was close to the point of suicide.nnSomething that had helped me at that time was thinking that I will only kill myself if it was the absolute last option, meaning I had done everything I could to get better, including things I never saw myself doing such as going to a therapist. I never thought I would ever see one for the same reasons as you, I could not ever see myself telling personal problems with a stranger or that any of those simple exercises would cure the pain I was in. If I could think myself to being happy I would have right? But then I went to therapy because I made a promise to myself that if I had gone through 5 therapists and read at least 10 books about anxiety and was still getting worse, I would end life there as it is to stop the suffering. I decided life at that time was at the very least worth that much effort. Well I am typing this now so you can see what happened. I forced myself to see a therapist through my college, which by itself took 3 months to set up. Then I learned I had developed depression because of the social anxiety. So please try to get diagnosed by a therapist. I would have never ever thought that's what was wrong with me at the time, I assumed it was just the social anxiety. Anxiety and depression are comorbid and can cause each other. The depression can really sneak up on you and make it even harder to deal with the anxiety and must be treated to get better.nnThe thing is, when you have these disorders like anxiety or depression, your view on the world is so incredibly distorted and the scary thing is, you can't see how warped you views are until you are better. You can try to find reasons for things like killing yourself and convince yourself of false truths that prove such ideas. I can tell you right now suicide is not a reasonable response to your situation. The things is, until you get better and are in a healthy frame of mind, everything you think is biased without you knowing, true emotional logic is impaired by these mental disorders. This is why is it so important to get outside perspective and in this case it is a therapist. Yes they will teach you exercises that seem dumb and are at times so simplistic you can seriously doubt if they can work. But they do. I still am baffled by the same thing but they. do. work. I am living proof.nnWalking into the room and meeting my therapist was so hard. In the end I felt like I couldn't open up fully to him and kinda lied about not needing therapy at all even though I still had some more emotional healing to do just to stop going. I don't advocate such a move lmao and will admit my social anxiety did hurt me there.nnBUT I DO NOT REGRET GOING FOR A SECOND.nnFrom what I what I was comfortable telling him, I learned exercises that I had never seen online despite constantly looking up ways to cure my social anxiety and buying books upon books. It also helped that having sessions and ""homework"" forced me to keep up with the exercises as I didn't want to look lazy (the only positive to the social anxiety lol). I gained perspective on automatic negative thoughts I was having. Without an outside perspective there was 100% no way I or anyone in my situation could have ever caught such things without a trained eye. I bought a book recommended by him that helped my depression immensely. But that was one of the largest social anxiety hurdles I had to go over because after that, the other hurdles got smaller and less difficult. You are forgetting that as you get better, things are not as hard and impossible and you gain more energy and optimism so as to deal with the upcoming difficulties. So even though I didn't love my therapist and stopped seeing him, the whole experience provided me with tools that I had never seen and perspective on how I thought and the ways my thoughts were unknowingly poisoning my mind.nnAnd now think what's the worst that could happen going? Its awkward and you don't like them? You don't feel like you can't open up to them? You feel like you're on the verge of a panic attack being there?  Just never return, you never have to see them again and they can't possibly make your life worse after seeing them once. Remember, these intense feelings are temporary, once you go home they can go away. The best thing that could happen going? You feel like your in control of your life again. You can connect with people. You can gain confidence to talk to girls (although remember there is nothing wrong with being your age and never having a girlfriend, I'm 20 and have never had a boyfriend). You can reduce your suffering. Please try to get help IT IS possible to get better and take back control of your life. That is the one thing you can never forget."
2588,"thebirdmindreader","comment","","This \^,  this was exactly what I was going to reply except /u/runescapeN3rd wrote it much better than I could have. Thinking in absolutes, like how the path to recovery is only more suffering, isn't reality. Life is more than just black and white, but there is a whole spectrum in between and this is how recovery is too. The path to recovery won't be painless at the beginning, but it won't only be painful the entire time either. Incorrect exposure therapy could make you feel terrible the entire time, as I tried doing it to myself and had no success. But when I did it correctly with a therapist it wasn't nearly as terrible and made me see progress, which really helped my recovery and made future tasks easier. Also, if you haven't seen a therapist and gone through the process before, how can you say this will definitely be the case? You can make infinite predictions about what the future holds from the past, but you will never know for certain until you have lived through the experience yourself."

I hated being Asian ever since I was in elementary school cuz I saw how my peers and ppl in general made fun of us all the time, and it made me ashamed ever since. Ik I personally can never know hard it is to be black and bisexual at your age. But believe me IK young and straight black boys can be extremely cruel. I’m from New York lol.nnHow those boys treated you, don’t let that be the reason for your weaknesses. Use their immaturity, ignorance, and cold-heartedness to RISE ABOVE and the reason why you won’t stoop to their level. It may be hard for you to accept or realize this now, but in the future, when none of the high school bs will matter, trust me that you will realize it by then. nnI can tell you this with confidence because that’s what happened to me. I was so suicidal back then, everyday I was just living life on auto pilot. I was a soulless empty and socially anxious being in high school. I didn’t have anybody to turn to and I didn’t have any solid sense of identity primarily because of my crippling SA. I’m not rlly sure if I even do to this day as someone who’s about to graduate college, also I still have SA, but I am in a much better place now because life does get better. I have my own reasons, with God being one of them, but also because I gave myself a chance. I started believing in myself. It was a long time coming, but it happened, and though I still have more progress to be made for myself, I needed to stop feeling so ashamed. and to believe that i have a chance at life. nnSo please, if you read everything I wrote, keep it in mind. If you need someone to just talk about anything I’ll be more than happy to help :)."
2698,"tiredinfinitely","comment","","I spent two years of college dealing with this exact same issue. It got so bad that eventually I stopped eating as much and lost weight because I couldn't go to the kitchen because that would mean I'd have to face my roommates. Every time I left my room to go to class or just go to the bathroom, I had this completely irrational fear that made my heart race. I spent too much time being afraid and stressed that it really affected my mental health and made my depression worse. I know this isn't what you want to hear and if I'm being honest, I'd probably still be doing what I used to, but you really don't want to end up how I did. My therapist really emphasized facing your fear and actually letting yourself sit in the feelings rather than avoiding them completely because it will at the very least help you build up a tolerance to the anxiety. Other than that I can't offer much advice but I hope you're able to get some comfort soon, SA is rough. "
2718,"Istuu17","comment","","I started experiencing sweating under my armpits when I was in 7th or 8th grade. It happened everytime I'd go out. On the bus, in the mall/grocery store, especially in school, doctor, cinema, dentist, my dermatalogist. Of course I didn't  realize what it was I just knew that I was always sweaty. Oddly enough no one ever noticed my sweaty armpits cause I did a great job covering it/hiding it. For me I'd sweat and have shortness of breath, my heart would beat very quickly and that's it. What blows my mind is that I've been dealing with nervous sweating since I was 13 and I'm 20 now."
2719,"ValtronW","comment","","For me, it comes from my own embarrassment. I recognize that my thoughts are illogical, perhaps even immature. There are some things that I can't even tell my fiance because I'm scared he's going to think I'm childish or worse, insane. Also, I don't want to drag him into my bullshit. Every time I have a mental breakdown, he doesn't know how to handle it and gets uncomfortable. He says I can talk to him, and I do. But I have to be careful about the conversation spiraling into a breakdown.nnI need a therapist. I don't want to put him through that ever again."
2721,"ValtronW","comment","","Omg yes, that's exactly my partner too! He tries to use logic and reasoning because he's a very logical person, but it's not what I need to hear. I explained to him last time I broke down that I need him to just be empathetic and be my cheerleader when I'm doubting myself. I need empathy, not logic. I think men are just like that, so I'm not mad at him. I need to work on expressing how I feel without basically exploding in front of him.nnI have no problem spilling my emotions to a counselor or therapist because they're use to it. It's their job.

2732,"many_breads","comment","","Y'all, that's depression. That's called passive suicidal ideation, which basically means that you'd think dying would be dope but aren't at the point where you actually want to do anything about it. It's nextdoor to active suicidal ideation and still dangerous. Don't think that just because you aren't ready to blow your brains out that you don't deserve help. _You are worth it too_nnThat said, I've been putting up with it for 10 years, so could be worse I guess.

I would strongly encourage you to reach out to a therapist because you don't have to feel this way. But I totally get that it's hard as fuck, so good luck bud"
2748,"Aminto9","comment","","You should definitely see a therapist. Therapy doesn't always work for everyone but it's definitely a good first step. Just having someone to talk to can be a huge help. If you've been doing therapy for a few months and don't see any improvement, then you could also consider talking to a doctor about medication for anxiety. I can't really tell you how to cure social anxiety as I'm still dealing with it myself (I'm also 17 and have dealt with SA for a few years) but I can say that talking to a therapist about it made me feel a lot less like there was something wrong with me. Good luck!"
2749,"Aminto9","comment","","That sounds like social anxiety to me but don't take my word for it because I'm no expert. If you don't mind me asking, how old are you? For me, retrospectively, I first started to have issues with social anxiety when I was about 13 years old. Although it didn't get really bad until I was about 15 (I'm 17 now). I wish I could give you advice on how to overcome it but I'm still trying to figure that out myself. I saw an online therapist for a few months and that didn't help me much. She just kinda told me to think positive thoughts and to do breathing exercises twice a day. Although I often forgot to do what she told me so maybe that's why it didn't work but idk. Now I started taking a medication that's supposed to help but so far it doesn't seem to be helping much either. The advice that I can give you however is that you should definitely try to get ahead of it asap. Talk to your parents or somebody that can help. I kept my anxiety a secret from everyone for so long because I felt like there was something wrong with me and it wasn't until a few months ago that I told my parents and I already feel a little better. I don't feel as ashamed of it as I used to. "
2760,"middleout","comment","","Honestly, it *could* help if you use it as an opportunity to work on yourself and your social anxiety, and take advantage of the fact that your schedule is more flexible (so you can seek e.g. therapy at any time of the day). However, because of the nature of social anxiety, it's probably a lot more likely to make things *so much worse* for you. I had pretty mild social anxiety in high school, but then I did a stint of online school in my last couple years. Being socially anxious, I didn't exactly seek out social groups and such in my free time, and I'd often go days/weeks without interacting with anyone outside of my immediate family. When I graduated, my social anxiety was so much worse. I couldn't hold down a job. I'd go into the back room and cry my eyes out after being put on register and then get fired. lol When I finally found a job, it took me months to feel semi-comfortable around the people I was working with 5 days a week. It was probably over a year before I felt like I *maybe* belonged there. nnI really wish I hadn't gone to online school. Being isolated for so long was really, really bad for me and to be honest I haven't fully fixed the extra social anxiety that came with it."
2761,"Aminto9","comment","","Hey! I'm also 17, (18 in a couple months), and I've been struggling with SAD since middle school. Interacting with strangers has always made me nervous and having to present in front of a class is like a living hell for me. It wasn't until around the end of summer that I finally told my parents about it and started to get some help. I tried online therapy for a few months but that didn't really help much. My therapist just had me do breathing exercises twice a day and watch these weird ASMR videos that are meant to calm you or something. Other to her credit I often forgot or just didn't do what she told me to. After that I started taking medication for SAD. IT's been probably 4 months since I started medication and I think i'm finally starting to see some results. I generally don't feel as nervous around people and especially strangers. Today I even did a short presentation in front of my class and didn't choke up or jitter like I normally do. "
2762,"jean0_","comment","","if you can find someone you vibe with it can be really beneficial. i was really lucky and found a therapist who helped me deal with a lot of my social fears.nnbut the important thing to remember is you need to be willing to put in the work, and that it’s not going to be a magical fix. there are a lot of situations where i still have the same anxiety i had before but it’s just more manageable. i would get discouraged a lot because i just wanted my anxiety to disappear, but that’s just not how it works unfortunately. nnif you set your expectations though i think it’s worth it. for me the best part was just being able to talk to somebody who really understood how anxiety worked without feeling judged. "
2763,"hedonistsoup","comment","","Oh my god, that sounds horrible. I'd be planning my move out of the country. But seriously, I'm sorry that happened. You could try sending her an e-mail saying you have social anxiety and it's embarassing to have her say those things. Orr try talking or e-mailing a counselor or someone else in the school. I know that's also probably embarassing but it might be worth it. I'm sure she doesn't want to upset you, she's just being thoughtless. nnHope it gets better ):"
2787,"Aminto9","comment","","Well for me, medication seems like it's starting to have help. I've been taking Setraline HCL for a few months. I started out taking 50MG and that didn't have any noticeable effect so I've been taking 100MG and that seems like it's starting to take effect. Although medication doesn't work for everyone so if I were you I'd try therapy as well and see which one works better for you. College is also a big concern for me because I'm worried about having to be around strangers 24/7.  Although similar to what you said, I also see it as an opportunity to make a try and make a different impression on the people around me for the first time in many years. I also have asked a girl out back in 7th grade when my social anxiety wasn't very bad. We were friends for a few months before and I kinda liked her so I decided to ask her out to an upcoming dance. I told one of my friends I was going to do it and he told some of his friends and so on until what seemed like the entire school knew. I still went through with it but I'm pretty sure spaghetti was streaming out of my pockets the whole time. At the time I wasn't expecting her to be my gf or anything, I just wanted to take her to the dance. I don't remember exactly how it happened but we ended up dating after that for like a month. Since then I've had 2 more gfs but they've both made the first move. "

2830,"LesserAnnoyingDog","comment","","Ah, it’s little comments like those that really eat at me, the gaslighting. One of the reasons it took me so long to get diagnosed with GAD, my sister and friends would tell me “you’re overreacting” or “you’re fine, you just need to get over it” yeah, really fucked me up good for a while. Made me believe I was going insane or making the whole thing up. Awful stuff. In hindsight I’ve learned that you know yourself best, and you can’t let people tell you nothing is wrong while your brain is screaming SOMETHING IS WRONG. Need to trust your gut and look after yourself."
2831,"didsomebodysaymyname","comment","","I'm sorry you're having a hard time. I have a few thoughts and maybe something that could help:nnEven if you want to change this, which is fine, try not to beat your self up about it. It is fairly normal to get upset when someone is yelling at you.nnAlso, those people teachers, bosses whatever shouldn't really be yelling at you for anything that isn't an emergency. And it doesnt sound like theres some ongoing emergency from your other comments.nnEveryone has struggles and you're no different, remember to take things one day at a time and if you fall back, just start again, one step at a time.nnAs for things that could help, you said therapy is not an option. Not sure why that is, but if it's money, and your at college/uni they may have some free help available, look into it.nnIf theres some other reason, or they don't have free help, try looking into cognitive behavioral therapy. It's often done with a therapist, but it's such a methodical treatment that you can get some benefit on your own and there are free apps that can help you practice it.nnIt sort of tries to retrain your brain from certain thought patterns and to practice regulating your thinking.nnHope that helps and good luck!"
2832,"auserhasnoname7","comment","","I find that it’s a matter of practice, and I’m not just saying to throw yourself into upsetting situations cause I tried that endlessly since that’s what everyone kept saying. The exposure works if you know what you’re doing and a therapist might be able to guide you.nnFor me personally it only worked when I did the following.nn- first I acknowledge my feelings when I start feeling upset cause sometimes it creeps up on you and when that happens then you don’t have a chance. The sooner you feel it build the better. if I don’t catch it before I feel my eyes water by then it’s usually too late but I’ve gotten better with it. nn- You gotta give a fuck about being good at not giving a fuck. You would think not caring about what people say and think would be easy and something you either can or can’t do but it’s a skill you have to work at.  Whenever something would get to me I’d tell myself, “who cares” “ fuck what they think” “eh whatever”. This has become automatic for me and now I hardly get emotional from confrontation.nnnstepdad and I would fight and we’d both look like assholes and I’d be a sobbing mess. Until one day when we fought and I didn’t get emotional for once after I’d been working at it for awhile. I realized nothing he’s saying is productive or making sense, and since I wasn’t crying I could see his crappy arguments for what they were, and basically just by being calm I already won and it killed the fight cause angry people are stupider.nnDon’t get too sold on that everyone should be accepting of your emotions stuff I see in the comments . While no one should be an asshole to you if you cry being able to stay calm around emotional people and situations is a fantastic skill to have in life. I freaking revel in being able to look at someone whose yelling and spitting mad with a deadpan expression, they get so frustrated when you don’t match them emotionally 😂. The work was worth it."
2833,"shneebnee","comment","","I've worked as a cashier but eventually got fired after messing up a lot (just 2 weeks after). Then I started working in a Cafe to make coffee and serve food quickly. I was able to hold this job for a while but got fired because they didn't need me anymore, I assume it's mostly because of the way I worked completely stressed out. I also worked in another Cafe but they replaced me with a family member of the guy who owned the Cafe. I tried working in IKEA customer support. It was the only job that had called me and I was desperate. I went to the practice session for a month and they thought I was still not ready for it. They told me I can still have more practice session but I needed to get paid desperately so I left. Most recent job was at a car wash but even there I completely messed up and had so many complaint and people yelling and all I got overwhelmed and stressed out and almost have a panic attack.

2839,"TomZanetti","comment","","I understand the struggle all to well my friend. It’s difficult to completely open up to someone normally, but with social anxiety it’s a whole other monster. It takes time to get comfortable with a therapist with social anxiety and that’s okay, first and foremost! That’s why I personally feel that medication and then therapy is a good way of doing things and some research backs this up, but look into it yourself and chose whatever you wanna do. I assume you haven’t taken medication for your anxiety? (If it worries you, just remember that your anxiety is an illness just like a chest infection is. Anxiety tends to exist when the brain is low is serotonin and this is an illness which medication can, to a small extent, help with and moderate)!nnI’m really sorry about what happened to you. It’s so obvious to us how our social anxiety affects us and to hear that through feedback from others must be devastating as it legitimises what you know to be true - that the anxiety has an affect on you. BUT — you’re working, going out every single day and doing work! You should be proud of yourself. I’ve never worked a day in my life (University and self employment being other reasons why) but mainly due to my social anxiety. After Uni, I want to feel able to work but the fact you’re doing that you should be proud of. And you’ll survive this, and get through it, and then you’ll look back and be even prouder of yourself. And if this was the thing you needed to, say, call up your doctors or give another therapist a go, then it could end up being the best thing that’s happened to you when you look back on it in two years time! Who knows.nnGood luck man, and keep me updated."

Your 20's will be a very transforming time.

That is a very easy first step.

If you're at university you could probably get some cheap therapy sessions. These could give you a very safe place to develop your skills. The therapist would fuction as your coach on this journey of self-improvement.nnTry not setting your goals to 'losing my virginity' or 'get a girlfriend'.

And that fact makes me incredibly sad, i know it's really dumb and pointless to care what others think of me after death but I do care what message do I leave behind in this world?

I know what I have to do in order to get better but I honestly have no fuckin clue how to control my emotions. Even after years of therapy and medications nnI'm not sure if I would want to be numb but feeling nothing is definitely better than being anxious and sad .

If possible you could try to find a therapist that can help you with your issues. You could start by writing just your thoughts on paper. You can keep it or burn it afterwards.

Take a moment to register how your body is reacting to everything, check in with yourself and see how your anxiety is affecting you right then. Maybe it's ""my cheeks feel hot"" or ""my thoughts are still fuzzy,"" but hopefully you'll get to the point where it's ""I can breathe.""

2912,"Ben_1999","comment","","Sorry that you have to deal with all of that bud. Yes I've been to therapy but I ironically never really got the chance to talk about this much. nThe advice I wanna give to you is to be honest with your friends if you feel okay with it, looking back I wish I had been more, thats why I wanna get in contact with them again. It's okay to tell them that they upset you, especially if they arent horrible to you constantly. If you're in year 7 (yes Im british too lol) then they don't genuinely mean it when they're being mean. If they're nice to you alot of the time  then that harshness is obviously coming from something they're dealing with at home or with someone else, I promise you they don't mean it and its very important that you don't blame yourself. Id try and be the nice person of your friend group, you very much seem like you are with your post but try and act a bit more positive with ppl. So when your friends are being mean for whatever reason, just be the better person in that situation, keep in mind that you haven't done anything wrong and respond with being kind and calm instead of defensive or upset (im not saying thats definitely how you'd respond but you get the idea lol). nnYou're a very smart person, and if the comment you left is any indication then you've got a very good life ahead of you lol. The advantage you have over me when I was your age is that you know how you feel about things and that you're okay with being open, thats brilliant! Because I didn't find out about my social anxiety until I was 16 and I wasnt able to deal with it until it had already had its affect on me. As long as you speak to ppl about it and ask for help when you need it, those horrible feelings you told me about will pass. Give it time and you'll be fine with this stuff in no time, I absolutely promise :)"

Im just a guy who sits in his room 24/7 and for a guy who wants more that really bothers me. And although these ppl arent the main thing holding me back in life, its hard not to think about it alot. The fact that it feels like I live in a prison cell rn just doesnt enable me to move on. nI know what my problem is, I dont really have anything to attach myself to because of that lack of self worth. I dont feel good at anything like you probably feel you're good at being a lawyer. nnI really dont wanna come off as dismissive btw, like I hate it when ppl are like that with me. I just feel my circumstances make it different in a way. Btw so sorry for typing so much lmao, hope that's okay😅"

The only thing I can say is forcing yourself to do it.nnI would also suggest if it's that bad and you have insurance or the money to pay a psychiatrist for anti anxiety medications. nnThey're like magic when you find the right one and you find yourself getting into a darker and darker hole they can make such a difference.nn"
2924,"Gottchen","comment","","Feel you so much but let me tell you to not overdo it. Try not taking it daily or starting in the morning. Try to make some days of pauses in between and then you should be okay with it. Alcohol gave me a bit of fun, feeling alive and social life back but it also ruined a lot for me. Look for a therapist, quit alcohol and get some medication that helps."
2925,"ChickenPie34","comment","","I had a teacher in high school do something similar, but with singing. She made me sing in front of the class and then told me how bad I was. I was super shy at the time (and only 12 years old) so you can imagine how devastating that was. As a result I have struggled with performance anxiety in any classroom situation since (now 25 and in therapy for anxiety). nnReport this asshole of a teacher. This kind of behaviour ruins peoples lives - or at least hurts them for a very long time - as was the case with me. Don't allow this to go un-checked because you deserve more respect. "
2926,"bubbled_pop","comment","","Yeah, all those teachers can all merrily go fuck themselves.  nIt reminds me of my middle-school math teacher: at 11 years of age she humiliated me because I had forgotten my homework and my parents couldn't bring it to school.   nShe and another teacher openly commented on my (not-really-good) grades in their respective subjects right when I was doing an oral quiz (in my country we do both oral and written quizzes) in front of the whole class.   nShe once misplaced my test and, instead of double-checking, she jumped the gun and was 100% convinced that I hadn't handed it over - and when she did find it (in her own teacher's journal, just in a different place than where the other tests were) she marked it on the spot making all sorts of faces then sneering at me for how poorly I'd done.   nAll of these happened in front of my entire classroom. FYI: we don't change classmates depending on the subject. Once you're grouped together with 20-30 other people on day 1, you will stay together for all subjects and grades of that stage, until you're able to move on to the next/graduate. I don't know if that makes it better or worse; the fact that we can't drop classes or switch them (unless you're willing to change school altogether) definitely made it worse, though.  nI'm turning 24 and I still bear the scars of what she and several other power-drunk-assholes-who-should-not-be-anywhere-near-emotionally-vulnerable-kids I've had the displeasure to meet in (13 years of) school have done to me.  nThe concept of counselor and the like is completely foreign to our school system; if we'd had one, that's what I might have considered turning to. If your country does, that's a nice place to start."

Physical and mental disabilities like depression do exist, and it sucks, but it doesn’t mean that those people don’t have purpose or can’t enjoy life for what they do have. I respect you so much for seeking treatment and implore you to try and find the little things in life you get enjoyment from, as well as adopting healthy habits (healthy for the mind) such as exercising, eating well, meditating and just thinking positive things and avoiding negative stimuli. I also implore you to not give up with treatment, I know it can be a long road from my own experiences, but you might not have found the right therapist for you or therapeutic methods, or perhaps not the right medication. Anyhow, I hope things get better bro."

3084,"whyisitsohardde","comment","","I think it might be SA. I kind of had selective mutism as a child, was never diagnosed, but basically I went like a year without talking to people in class that I wasn’t friends with, to the point that when I spoke, people would be like “wow she talked!”. I was quite talkative with the friends I was familiar with though. nnThis kind of stopped when one day I just told myself I’m not gonna be like this anymore. And then I started talking more. It was kind of weird like I just decided to wake up one day and snap my fingers, but that’s actually how easy it is. You don’t have to go out of your way to talk to people but if you have a need, like you need to borrow a pencil, try and voice out that concern. Something that helped me to is to realise people really don’t care, they’re too self absorbed to really dwell on other people anyways, so even if you mess up or make a mistake, chances are they’d forget about it the day later. And if they do judge you and don’t treat you well, then I guess it’s a good thing to stay away from them."

You're right, it still requires good communication skills, but I somehow landed the job anyway and I was generally OK with talking to people but I could be awkward/nervous/shy if my SA flared up.nnI've found that my communication skills have improved massively on the job - I'm now more comfortable talking to people, have no problems chatting informally with my team, can voice my thoughts more easily in group discussions, etc. It's not perfect - but in some senses getting a job that REQUIRES communication skills is a form of treatment for me. It forces you to learn and adapt. It also lets you realise what types of situations you feel more/less comfortable in.

Sadly i can't just go and travel somewhere on my own since i'm only 15, I did travel across the country to visit a friend last year, i had tons of panic attacks while i was on the train but in the end it really helped me, sadly i can't do that often enough to actually build up my confidence tho. My therapist told me that my social anxiety will never go away and that i just have to learn to live with it wich is really hard. Going out with friends helps me cope with my social anxiety a lot but it's hard to do when all my friends live 2-6 hours away from me."
3101,"whyisitsohardde","comment","","omg you sound a lot like me!! though I’m way younger than you, but yep I come from an Asian society too and there’s a lot of emphasis on prestige. actually these pressure don’t really come from my family but more from my peers because I come from an elite school where everyone is just gunning for really big dreams. I was like that once too until my mental health really plummeted this year and I realised I wasn’t happy at all chasing something society wanted. So I’ve tried to break free from those expectations and I feel really liberated. I’m thankful my family doesn’t also place such expectations on me, so I don’t feel as pressured, but with all my peers going on to really prestigious universities and Med school, can’t say I’m too relaxed haha.nnI also really relate to the part where a lot of people that have success I secretly don’t think they deserve it, but oh well this is life right! It isn’t always fair. I believe in God too and to be honest that’s one of the firm pillars of my life being a Christian, and it really helps to stop me from comparing with others and participating in the rat race (if I recall, there is a bible verse that goes alone the lines of “do not fall in love with the world” and I think it’s really powerful! sometimes we get too caught up and start loving the world too much and it’s materialism, but that all doesn’t matter when we meet God at the end. career prestige, wealth, and things of the world, these all don’t give us true happiness, it’s our faith and trust in God that does.)nnwhat I’ve tried to help me is to start doing the things I truly like. For example, I love singing. I may not be the best at it, but when I sing I get true enjoyment out of it, and I truly feel like I’m living life.nnIt sounds really hard when you’re surrounded by people who are so successful, but one message I found really helped me is that people are really on different tracks. Someone who may be so advanced in their career may have a character deficit. Yada yada. What you see on the outside may not be truly what it seems. Once I’ve accepted that I’m on my own track, and I don’t have to follow other people’s track, makes things feel better. nnAlso I had dreams of being a child psychiatrist though I don’t think I’ll be able to handle the job scope, but I found it interesting how similar we are.nnGood luck!"

3149,"ThomasTheBigHorse","comment","","Don't do nothing. Many people think that this is something that will go away with time. It's not. Many people say this because the people who do manage to overcome social anxiety actually put in a lot of effort to overcome it, instead of just trying to cope. I don't want to start a war here, but this sub seems to be mostly oriented on coping. I don't think you will find much good advice here to overcome this. nnYou don't want your daughter to learn how to live with social anxiety, you want her to learn how to kick its ass. Please take her to a therapist. I tried a long time to do it by myself and I actually made a huge amount of progress. The problem is that most people need a therapist to get good guidance on how to completely overcome it. This is where I'm at.nnSocial anxiety can be overcome with gradual exposure. You need her to start doing things that make her uncomfortable. If she doesn't want to, make her. Try finding things that will make her slightly unccomfortable and make her do it. She won't like it, but it will help. If I wouldn't have done anything, I'd be in a really bad place at the moment. Please, get her a therapist and make her do uncomfortable things.nnThis sub will probably not like my advice and only suggest to be open with her and try to make her more comfortable. Be open with her and let her talk a lot, but don't help her avoid social situations, this will just make it worse."
3155,"ThomasTheBigHorse","comment","","I guess you are right. A good analogy would be with smokers. We did everything we could to get my dad to stop smoking, but that never worked. He never wanted to, there was no point in trying. Other family members who were smokers woke up one day and had enough. They started taking the steps to quit the habit and they did it because they wanted to.nnHowever, the problem is that we are dealing with a teenage girl. Chances are that she won't want to try to change and prefer the easy way out: doing nothing. Humans have a tendency for inertia. I think most teenagers would rather use things to cope than take the steps to fix their issue. nnIf the mom doesn't try to somehow intervene, the daughter will never get better and will simply get worse until she decides to change, which could never happen. nnIt's a very touchy subject. I think a therapist would be better equipped to help the mom and daughter. I think the mom should go to a therapist first to see what would be the best approach."

I can't really go in depth as to how to learn not to care about that because I am on mobile right now. nnThe thing I did is exposure therapy.

But you have to take small steps and the first one is acknowledging that you have anxiety or depression, the second is talking to someone about it and that is what you have done.

If someone would have tried to tell me that years ago, I would have told them they are full of shit. You are a fighter and a champion for coming this far, you will CONQUER this.nn Tip : Don't get too hooked on social media. Social media is often a false representation of reality.

And even I dread about what would happen to my fam if I did end it all. We have a lot in common. I have depression and anxiety too.nnHonestly, theres only two things that still keep me going. 1) The idea that if I keep struggling then eventually something will give. If I keep fighting I'm only bound to get better at controlling my urges. And if I keep searching I probably will find better medicine or therapy or whatever else is out there that can help. And this is easier said then done. I was having a depressive episode just yesterday. I was feeling hopeless but it passed. My life and social anxiety is better than what it was 10 years ago, not by a lot but it still matters because I struggled a lot to make that little improvement.nnThe second thing I tell myself is, and I accept this is not the most pleasant of motivators. Is the fact that I'm going to die one day anyways. Whats the point of killing myself today. I only have few years to live provided I dont die by an accident or something.

I absolutely hated it.nnAs difficult as it is sometimes, I  believe that working DOES help with social anxiety, at least to give you more experience on how to deal with people. Currently, I have been working for the past 10 years as a receptionist at a doctors office. I really love it now but it took me about 2 years to get comfortable enough with my job that I didn't fear going in every day. Now I have so much confidence and I am even braver than my much older coworkers at times when it comes to dealing with difficult people. Do I still get anxiety dealing with people? Absolutely.

I am hopeful I guess but also, its a good place to go for me cause then it feels like I am part of something good (a group of people). I don't know."
3267,"jsphzeleke","comment","","Just becuase some people’s anxiety get temporarily relieved with the use of alcohol doesn’t mean they don’t still have anxiety. If anything more people should be questioning if they have social anxiety expecially if they show symptoms. It’s more of a good thing that mental illness is getting accepted and people are questioning whether they have anxiety or depression. That way more people go to therapists and psychologists to work through their issues."
3282,"xgd8","comment","","Hope is not lost, you will get better with your anxiety as time goes on.nnI went through high school practically comatose and did nothing but isolate myself and play video games in my room. I didn't even go to my first high school party until I was in my early 20's. College wasn't much better as I was still awkward and didn't make fast friends. It wasn't until I got out into the working world that I gained a lot of experience and confidence talking to people. I also dated someone who forced me to travel and get out of my comfort zone (which I really needed.) Nowadays I am in my early 30's and am happily married to someone who also has social anxiety. My anxiety is still with me but I am the happiest and most content I've ever been in my life.nnI found medications to be beneficial; the Benzodiazepines helped me when I had to be in social situations and the antidepressants helped me get out of the recurrent funk I was in about my situation. And while I never did formal therapy, I am a firm believer that therapy can work wonders. Just talking about it will help you feel better and they will give you small goals to accomplish which will help you manage your anxiety."
3305,"screaminghello","comment","","I'm 17, and I'm in the same boat as you. I can't get therapy for my anxiety on the basis that I have no job. I've just spent the past hour looking for more 'quiet' jobs and yikes...you got, library, artist, writer, blogging...etc.basically more stay at home esc jobs. try looking and seeing if some local businesses don't get many customers and apply there...that would mean less of a stressful work day. Or apply somewhere you are very familiar with, and enjoy the environment(that is if such a place exists) I don't think you should force yourself to work somewhere very social and outgoing, because it *might* be good for you, ya know? but if your really forced into a corner, set goals that can be achieved through the monetary gain, like concerts, or nice clothes. I know it wont fix it, but its something."

Taken lots of meds in combination with therapy to help but none of them have worked. The only thing that has helped with previous phobias has been exposure so maybe I need to apply that to this situation too."

3348,"Olofsdotter","comment","","Well, I do have access to it, but I live in Sweden and the healthcare system isn't exactly what it used to be. the waiting time for someone like me would be several years, most likely. My childhood therapist from BUP (the swedish children's psych department) can't transfer me to the adult department now that I'm over 18 since I've been released from my sessions more than five years ago and deemed ""mentally stable"". I am not mentally stable, and neither was I at that age. But being a stupid kid I did everything in my power to convince everyone I was OK. I succeeded and I regret that now. Without a reference and not being actively suicidal or homicidal the waiting time is ridiculous. Also, i don't even know if I'm ready to open up to them about my problems. I feel so ashamed."
3349,"Olofsdotter","comment","","I've thought about talking to a counselor at The Youth Clinic. They provide support for young people between the ages of, I think, 13 and 23. They deal with everything from mental health issues to abortions and treament for STD's. They don't have qualified therapists, but they offer counseling for free. Might be worth a shot perhaps. At least while waiting for ""the real deal""."
3350,"Olofsdotter","comment","","Yeah, thanks. I suppose that's true. Back then I was sooo scared of being locked up or something because I was convinced that I was crazy in the head. I had intrusive thoughts, paranoia and lots of other symptoms that all point to OCD and anxiety, but I was too afraid to share it with my child psychiatrist. The same goes for my depression and recurring suicidal thoughts. I thought that they'd have put me in a straitjacket if they found out about it lol. Maybe they actually would have. Guess I'll never know. nnAnyways. It's too late now (I'm over 18) to use my child psychiatrist as a reference and way in to the adult ward. Up until 18 I was promised (an offer that has now expired) a fast lane if I ever felt a need to talk to someone. But, not knowing the potential consequences of making that call, I hesitated and now I'm here - 19 y/o, severely depressed and on the road to self destruction, physically and emotionally. Sigh. There's really no other option for me but to go the regular route and get myself in the back of the long line. It will take years, sure, but I suppose it's better to put myself on the waiting list sooner rather than later."
3351,"Olofsdotter","comment","","I definetely get what you mean about loving yourself. I've never been able to truly accept myself, I've even been appalled by the idea of it. Like, I feel so ugly, stupid and worthless that I don't deserve to like myself or be liked by others. I don't know where this negative self image comes from (I've been treated well and with love my entire childhood) so it's probably more nature than nurture. Some people are just more self destructive than others, I guess. As a child I often, naïvely, wished to be a psychopath just so I wouldn't feel all that shame, guilt and sadness all the time. nnWhile I haven't yet been able to love myself, I've discovered the importance of having a healthy ego and not be ashamed of it. This has helped me a lot. As you can tell by this post, I'm far from healed and I don't know if my mind will ever truly recover, but non-religious spritualism/divination including the use of ritualistic psychodrama and working with Tarot and a pendulum has aided my mental health. It works as a sort of meditation and gives me time for personal reflections. It also gives me self-induced confidence through ego boosting rituals (most likely a placebo/sugar pill effect from believing strongly that I will see results, I'm aware). I hope to see greater progress in the future by continuing to do this. I will also try to get hold of a therapist to talk about my issues. Just gotta work up the courage first. nnAlso, thanks for the tip regarding ""The Portable Therapist"". I'll definetely check it out. :)"

3357,"Jimmy244","comment","","Yeah, I feel like it will benefit me to take part in an internship, though it's EXTREMELY competitive in my area, since there aren't many. Most I find are in other, far places that are out of the question. Which further makes me feel inadequate and like I'm not good enough. Making me feel like I'm gonna burn out by trying so hard to get in with a good demo reel or portfolio (which I do not know the best way to execute and googling yields varying results. nnThe ones I found are actually paid, according to the websites. I just overthink everything in terms of how to go about them, and even worse is my GPA is barely average, maybe like a B- average mostly due to early classes I took when I was in a different major and some Gen Eds I failed. nnIt's like I'm being pounded with these negative thoughts and sometimes I feel like I'm going to explode or think to jump out my window. Thank you for understanding me. I really want to go to a therapist but I am scared to. Even my parents say I should go. I haven't actually been to any kind of doctor in nearly 4 years. So I am honestly unsure of the state of my physical and mental health, which makes me more scared to go."
3359,"Jimmy244","comment","","Yeah, I think so too. Except that my mom doesn't think I have depression, assuming I'm fine. I once said that I feel like I have depression because I am always thinking negatively and lack the energy and total interest in doing what I love, but she said that's not really being depressed.  There are sometimes where I get in the zone and could sit for hours straight working on something or playing a game, whatever it is, with enthusiasm and my total attention while keeping the negative thoughts away. Maybe I have something deeper? like uneven moods?  I find it hard to make conversation with people, even about the things I like doing, and seem dull (I hate my voice) I am pretty boring in group settings, etc.nnI am with you on the decision making. I find it really hard to make decisions, for example, when it comes to people asking what I want to do, or what I want to eat, etc. I usually respond with ""anything"" and can't really come up with my own opinions. I do things only if I am familiar with it and comfortable. I rarely try new things. nnNote that I have never done drugs or drink, as typical with people who have some of these issues, I have just been this way for many years and now I'm really becoming self aware and it sucks. nnThat is good that you seem to be making progress by going to therapy and from what you describe feels like it might help me. Even the meds. I just always assumed all they do is just ask what's wrong. Honestly, I feel like I would fare well even if I can just submit everything in writing to a therapist. And thank you. I also wish you well on your journey :)"

Anyways ur doc might suggest something for u to try like meds, therapy or idk support groups"
3429,"uncontentified","comment","","Yeah I mean exposure therapy is one of the best ways to combat social anxiety. The thing is you have to put absolutely no pressure on yourself. If you start thinking “I have to act normal right now and not blush once ever again” you will always fail it as that’s what happened with me.nnBut if you just go into every situation and attempt to really just not care what people think then slowly after time you will feel more comfortable in situations and in however many years you will be completely fine (if not sooner) so yeah the best thing is whenever you start to think about how much you screwed something up in a social situation just try and think of something else. Literally anything you can and eventually you will block it out completely by not giving it any power and not caring about it or thinking about it constantly.nnBelieve me it’s really fucking hard but you will get there, never give up!"
3433,"ValtronW","comment","","I kinda get what you mean. I just recently started therapy and four sessions it, I'm questioning if there's even a point.

Maybe I just need medication, because CBT only helps so much....sigh."
3439,"yikesamillion32","comment","","Thank you so much for taking the time to write a thoughtful reply to me! I am definitely in a similar boat that you are in.  While I like the way that wellbutrin manages my depression, I do not feel that it is as effective with managing my anxiety.  I was previously taking lexapro which worked wonders for my anxiety but I had to take myself off of it because I couldn't deal with being an emotionless zombie all the time.nn I definitely feel that a xanax prescription would help greatly with my anxiety, but I am nervous about directly asking for it from my physician because I am not in therapy right now, and I have heard that asking for a specific medication is a red flag.  Plus it doesn't help that I get anxious speaking about my condition to my physician which often leads to me severely downplaying the negative impact this is having on my life.  nnI think my next step is probably getting myself to a therapist that I am comfortable openly communicating with.  Good luck, I hope things improve for you also :)"
3440,"ValtronW","comment","","I think that's a good idea. But bear in mind that it may take several sessions to start benefiting from therapy, much like taking a new medication. And, yeah, I get that, you're probably just feeling uncomfortable and it shows on your face. Been there. Just remember that this can all be worked on if you're willing to try. You probably won't fix everything 100%, and that's totally fine. You gotta still be you!nnSmile more, if you can. Manage your anger. Be polite. It goes a long way."
3441,"DreamCatcher1985","comment","","I think all of the above maybe I should see a psychologist because I feel like I am just different from everyone else. Talking to someone, connecting with them, they all just make it look so easy. I have a rather cold and blank expression most of the time and most people interpret that as me being sad or pissed off. And they’re not wrong technically but it goes much deeper than that."
3450,"yikesamillion32","comment","","Take a deep breath and don't beat yourself up too much.  Try to distract yourself tonight with something that you enjoy doing, and then give yourself time tomorrow to reflect on what happened today and your feelings about it.  Even though you did not make it to the interview, having the chance to interview at a good paying job is a big accomplishment in itself and you should be proud of yourself! It also shows that you are qualified and have a set of skills that are desirable to employers.  Maybe this one got away from you, but keep your chin up and your eyes open for other opportunities that will undoubtedly come your way.  If you are in therapy, speak to your therapist and develop strategies to help combat your interviews fears, and perhaps even suggest that your therapist perform a mock interview with you to help you prepare.  Best wishes to you!"
3480,"vrycoolusername","comment","","Totally agree, stopped browsing this sub regularly long ago because of this. It's ridiculous how unhelpful and absolutely karmawhore this sub reddit has turned to. It used to be a place for venting, discussions, treatment ideas, success stories, and a bunch more. Now it's basically a joke. It makes social anxiety disorder seem like some kind of funny and insignificant thing, even though it can cripple your life in extremely severe ways. I don't get how anyone can feel better about themselves by laughing at the misery their own disorder gives them. I don't see this sub as helpful anymore, it only makes you feel less validated and cared for since serious posts get buried under all these stupid and non funny memes. Oh but by looking at a million memes that aren't funny you can laugh at yourself and see that you're not alone!!!!! No, that doesn't help. Discussing about serious topics like mental disorders requires a serious attitude."
3490,"artofficialflynn","comment","","Yea I was thinking the same except I also do this even when I know it’s an important call from a number I’ve already labeled like CVS calling me to tell me my prescriptions been refilled or the doctor calling to ask to make another appointment or a company calling me about a job application I sent and wanting to schedule an interview. I know I should be picking these things up and most shouldn’t be a big deal but for some reason I feel pressure answering the first ring so I leave it to voicemail even tho I already know exactly who it is lol"

3512,"minibabymochi","comment","","I literally don’t know. It depends. I went to my doctor about it and started going on some meds. Other than that I put myself into situations.

And then when I started working I just made sure to ask questions. I mean u kinda are forced to talk but it’s not that difficult. There should be friendly ppl and otherwise all ur doing with customers is taking their order (I’m a barista)"
3513,"Zomaarwat","comment","","If you think it's because you're not used to the situation, then the obvious thing to do would be to go for it anyway and try to get used to the environment. (Easier said than done, of course.) You don't have to go all out immediately, of course, but maybe doing smaller, low pressure things with a friend could help you acclimatize better. Go for a walk, run errands, play a game at home or wherever you're comfortable, that sort of thing. nnI would also recommend looking up a few breathing exercises, as focusing on something else can often help with nervousness. You could also try telling someone you trust about your problem, so they can help you calm down when you feel nervous or nauseated again. You might be having overstimulation/hypersensitivity issues, so taking an occasional breather while out being social might be all you need. nnThat said, I'm no professional. If this keeps up, you'll want to see a therapist or similar who's better suited to help you overcome anxiety. You can't just keep avoiding people forever, after all. Well, you could, but that's no way to live."

I was even nervous to record myself talking but I pushed through for the sake of my degree/parents money and passed with a B, I get my diploma in a month. Maybe you can try to talk to your professor about your social anxiety, usually that has worked for a lot of ppl. My sister was able to back out of taking public speaking completely by talking to her dean and showing proof of medication (also crying in front of her about her SA lol), so if you can, talk to your doctor about prescribing you Lexapro, etc. that way the professor is more inclined to go easy on you."

Or at least that's how I imagine it in my head. It's a bit nerve wracking at first, but after you have one or two conversations you can get in the swing of it.

I'll be 25 soon and still can't figure out my brain and how to stop letting my fears control my life. nnNot sure if this will help you, but I deal  with social anxiety, ADD and OCD. I've found that a lot of my anxiety stems from my inability to focus. When I can't focus I can't address people or my job appropriately, and that just amps up the anxiety levels even more. When my psychiatrist recommended Adderall I was skeptical since it's a stimulant, but it actually helped me in more ways than one.  My focus increased, my energy increased, my anxiety diminished a bit. No, it didn't go away entirely, but it has helped in some ways. I've also found that Adderall with a tinnny bit of Xanx also helps. It's what I'll take before a big event where I know I'm going to be a mess. It just helps me feel a little bit more normal. A little bit more in control.nnNext, EXERCISE. I know, it's literally the last thing you want to think about. But seriously. Do it. I love to swim, or even just go on a long walk. It works your pent up anxiety OUT. nnMy biggest struggle has been just accepting that... this is how I am. Kind people will not judge you for being awkward with them. They will have enough empathy to see past your weird quirks and see who you really are. The essence of you... I'm a new teacher, and I have a lot of anxiety around parent communication. While many parents aren't helpful or kind, there are those few in every class who go out of their way to be kind to me. Those kinds of people are the only people worth having in your life. Those are the kind worth wasting your energy on. nnLastly, your anxiety isn't you. It is the monster hanging onto your back and weighing you down. See it as that.Something separate from yourself. It isn't you. It shouldn't define you. When you have those negative thoughts direct them at that anxiety monster and not yourself.... haha I hope that made some ounce of sense. nnI hope this helped in some way. Please know that YOU ARE NOT ALONE. I'm struggling with you... but one day we will find peace. You are not a lost cause. &lt;3"

Therapy and meds don’t do it for me either, I’ve even done those outpatient programs before (against my own will) and I just grew more hostile because of it and hated the fuck out of it. I’d stay away from that kind of stuff.nn My suggestion is to pick up a skill? Like music and art is a great outlet and a better alternative to drugs and alcohol but I’m not here to change your way of coping just giving you a different perspective. I spend a lot of time alone just making beats and playing guitar (I’m not very good but it’s gets my mind out of negative places) sometimes I’ll jam with some friends of mine I’ve made through music and the anxiety sort of goes away because we have a common ground with each other. Painting and listening to music or podcasts is also a nice thing.  Just an idea. nnIf there’s something you like to do or that you have a nack for whether it’s an art or a sport I’d just lock in on that and focus on your own abilities and not worry about what other people think. The world is harsh and people suck. I’m still learning that to this day,  it seems like you have a rough home life and it’s keeping you from getting out there.

At least I don’t think that anybody noticed that I was struggling. Everybody I knew were thinking that I wanted to be that shy guy who never actually expresses his own opinion or takes part in conversations, the problem was that I did not wanted to be that guy in the first place. I remember the times when I was coming back to school expecting to become better( being somebody who people enjoy spending time and being friend with). As you can guess, I did not. When the time to say something or actually communicate with other people came, all those desires disappear due to my social anxiety. nnTo overcome it I started finding some mutual interests with my classmates in order to integrate myself into their group. Nevertheless, I was able to find likeminded people and even 1 friend in the group which the rest of the class considered geeks or nerds who were interested in games, programming, computers, movies and 1 person who ultimately became my close friend in self improvement. I chose this group because the other part of the class was either interest in almost nothing or only cloth, drinking, partying and everything related to that, I just did not see myself as part of that group.nnThe problem is that what worked for me, will not necessarily work for you as I don’t know how actually big your problem is. But I will give you some universal tips.nn1. First handle problems that you can actually handle by yourself( like your math problems).nn2. Secondly, I would recommend you to go into Self-Improvement topic as it was the beginning for me and I accomplished so much since then. nn3.

And remember - it is okay when you are different, try to find something positive about it and move on. The important think is to stay up to your ideals and constantly find ways to make yourself and your future better. As I promise you, in a couple of years you will be remembering these times or with smile, or with nostalgia, or with regrets but at the same time you will remember that past is past but the future that is waiting for you is still there, and it is brighter than ever.

3584,"KaDeCh","comment","","**TL;DR:** Pre-planned one-on-one chill session(?) with work friend turned into me being a third wheel in a 4/5-person group. nnI’m probably late to the karma party, but I hung out with a work friend at a mall two weeks ago. It was supposed to be just us two. It took us a month to actually hang out after we said we should hang out for various reasons. On the day we were supposed to hang out (about 5 hours before), I asked her if we were still on (since I guess that’s what you’re supposed to do in this generation). They confirmed, but they also said they were bringing their sibling. They didn’t ask me if I was okay with that or even tell me in advance. They said “hey I’m bringing my sister but she won’t stay long.” nnSo, I see my friend and her sister. Her sister seemed cool. We played some games for a little. Halfway through, I noticed both of them texting at the same time. I’m feeling completely excluded and what not, but I try to stay positive. About 15 minutes later, their friend “randomly” pops up. Later, I got confirmation from my friend they invited that other person when they were texting. nnMy friend’s sister and invited friend go walk around the mall and my friend and I walk someone else. We met back with them at the food court and it was basically the 3 of them having their own conversation and I’m sitting there awkwardly. I heard them discussing “girlfriend” and “coming”, so I’m getting nervous thinking another person is coming, and that’s exactly what happened. nnWhen that third person came, I didn’t spend more than 5 minutes there. I told my friend I would see her later and I went home. My friend later apologized only for her sister inviting her girlfriend (I’m guessing because my friend and her sister’s girlfriend are not close). She didn’t apologize for inviting her sister last minute or inviting her friend when we were already hanging out. But she apologized for what her sister did like it. nnThat irked me and it still irks me a little bit."

Anyhoo, I got angry enough to put on my mic when my team began complaining about my no mic-ness so I turned it on and said ""i don't have to talk"", in which one guy was like ""..haha...welcome to the real world.."" and then condecendingly,""what do you have social anxiety or something?""  He then started nicknaming me a immature belittling nickname and treated me like a dog... then at the end of the game when we all died, he said it was my fault.nn&amp;#x200B;nnI can understand being in team-based games and wanting everyone to communicate, but I don't accept people who treat other humans like shite over it (cause who knows the reason-- noise in the house, no mic, anxiety, whatever). It just is an example of ignorance (which unfortuantely keeps my anxiety going but i'm gonna work on this). nn&amp;#x200B;nnAt that moment it was hard for me to kind of not take it personal, but with my understanding, really he was just a guy who was inconsiderate and more selfish than to really be open minded with the situation"
3598,"brainxmelt","comment","","Oh and the session was like this - she asked why I am there and I just told her how I feel- then she asked a bunch of questions (but they didnt feel intrusive it was like, only questions about what i had chosen to tell her- she didnt assume things about me or anything) and then she gave me some worksheets to test for GAD, depression and a couple other things. And then - most psychologists use cognitive behavioural therapy so they just explain what is happening in your brain and why they think it could be happening and ask if you agree that thats why and then talk you through how they are gonna help. But like I said that was only the first session."
3599,"brainxmelt","comment","","So- I have only been to one session so far- I was worried about the same things. Even worse is I had to go to a counselling psychology intern because I don't have money for a fully qualified one.  But then I realised psychologists have CHOSEN their profession because they want to help people like us. And even if like- you get somebody who happens to be there just for money or something, the fact remains that their focus will be to analyse you for the purpose of understanding your situation from a medical point of view- they have studied to do this, they have had to analyse tons of other people before you and they would be pretty much out of a job if they ever did something like hold their laugh in or talk about you. nnI'm not sure if you will understand this analogy but let me try. If you think about figure drawing, when an artist is drawing a nude model they are focused on the shapes and proportions and tones- they dont see a ""person"" and they dont like- perv over them or judge their bodies because they are focused on the process of drawing. When I went for a session it kind of felt like that- but just, from a medical stand point. She looked at me like she was just trying to understand a situation not like she was judging me as a person."

There might be areas that you are less intelligent in, but that doesn't make you an ""idiot"". Those terms are extremely subjective. I can't go to the doctor and get diagnosed as an idiot.

3715,"screenfreak","comment","","I'm a socially anxious 23 year old virgin with little to no dating experience like yourself but I'm a man. Something I learned in life is Men are typically the pursuers, and Women are typically the choosers. Men typically have to make the first move. People may not agree with my statement, but that's based on my experience.For me I feel I have to make the first move every time, and it's very hard as an anxious person. One time I was getting intimate with a woman I kind of knew well. She was very attractive and easy going. So I'm back at her place and one thing turns to another, we make out on her bed and I take off my shirt. I was (am) very determined to lose my virginity at the time. I was about to move from a big city to a small town a few days later and wanted to take advantage of every social opportunity. My shrink said I have to take chances sometimes and obviously respect consent.  She lets out a hard ""no!"" She wasn't down and she simply said she takes things slow. In the past, in ""romantic"" scenrios I usually walk out and don't do anything out of fear that I'm gonna be rejected and told I'm a creep or something like that. I was disappointed that finally I had taken a chance and it didn't work exactly as I wanted. However, I didnt feel unhappy because I was proud I took a chance. For once, my negative perception on myself didn't come in. I rationalized that she wants to take it slow and that's how it is. It's not me. nnBased on what you said, the guy was trying to ""pursue"" you and it's ok if you feel uncomfortable and explain that you're not down. It's ok to take things slow and you shouldn't do anything you're not comfortable with. If you choose, hit him up again and see what happens is my advice. I bet if do hit him up, and you like each other he won't think anything of your last encounter. Good luck. Could also use some constructive criticism myself for how I am trying to manage my social anxiety in these situations."

I recommend switching psychiatrists. Life’s too short to stay with a doctor you don’t feel is listening to your concerns. nnI have felt my face flush a few times while I was luckily around mirrors and I can tell it didn’t look as bad as I expected after taking meds. Maybe your blushing isn’t as bad as you think it is anymore. I definitely still feel it in my face the same way though even if I appear less red. I have heard of people who take higher dosages so ask the doctor! They’re used to people having questions so don’t be shy or feel like you are being annoying. Tell them your blushing is your biggest concern and they might have other options for you. I’m sorry you are dealing with this and you are not alone."

We turn our attention in ward and focus on a negative image of oneself which is biased and distorted. This image is created by the mind which is internal. By focusing outward you feel good. n3. Rumination after social situations. nAfter exiting from a social situations don't focus on what bad you did. It's one of the maintain factor for.... nJust let be what it is.

Let's be brave many people suffer for a long time probably life long. I am 21. I don't want to live like this. I will do exposure. Even if I feel bad. Keep hitting and trying.

Now i'm able to stand and sit almost completely straight for a little bit if i just strech my back beforehand and i put some muscles on my naturaly weak frame which gives me a lot of confidence.nnBut as was previosly said, these days bad posture is everywhere and it's not as eye-grabbing as it used to be so you shouldn't be worried about it that much.nnKeep working on it tho, it's only going to help you in many ways."

3865,"t00fargone","comment","","Well for like retail, fast food, supermarket work, I never heard of jobs like that requiring work experience. Most hire high schoolers for their very first job. However, for a little more advanced than cashier work, volunteer opportunities can be helpful and can fill a gap on a resume. It lets employers know that you are motivated and not lazy. Volunteer work can be done at any place and at any organization. I’m in the same boat, I am in college and worked at a grocery store and have been trying to get a job that is in my major of social work that doesn’t require a degree since I’m still in school. I finally got a job working as a special education aide with middle schoolers with emotional and behavioral issues. I had no experience for that other than cashier work at a grocery store and a job at McDonald’s when I was in high school. However, I had volunteer experience as a volunteer crisis counselor for crisis text line that I did online from the comfort of my own home. That helped me get my current job. If you are in college, then I would speak to your advisor or if your school has a career center then I would speak to them, they can refer you to volunteer opportunities/internship opportunities that can help you build your resume. Also, utilize student job fairs at colleges as the companies try to recruit students and realize that they have little job experience. If you are a high school student, then it doesn’t make much sense why you couldn’t get a retail, supermarket, fast food type cashier job as they always hire high schoolers and require no experience."

But still this undefinable nervousness is there and if you would ask me where I would feel this nervousness I couldn't tell. It's just such a fucking weird and exhausting feeling. The first days it was much worse so I still want to wait some weeks and then look.nnNice to hear that quitting Bupropion won't be a problem because I always hated that shit on SSRIs, SNRIS, etc. nnGABA, yes, I always loved GABA substances for my social anxiety and depression. Alcohol once was my best friend I regretfully abused but fortunately I got to quit it a long time ago. Benzodiazepines of course. They do their thing but for sure not my favourite and I never abused them or have a big desire for them. Another thing is phenibut, oh my god, best substance I could use for social anxiety and depression but tolerance builds up much too quickly so you can't take it everyday even if I did that for about 3 months in doses of 3-6g a day.

My part-time job didn't help but that was because my boss was an ungrateful, assholic piece of shit (I quit a year ago so I'm okay saying this. They cannot fire me if I quit a year ago). I was paid less just 20 cents above minimum wage, and my coworker IN THE SAME DEPARTMENT made almost $10 an hour while I'm making like $7.75 or $7.80 an hour, and I've been working there for four or five years. My boss lied to me about a raise, then kept telling me how shitty of a worker I was. Needless to say I quit out of spite because I was tired of being treated worse than the rainy day mats. nnNow I'm anxious because I hope this doesn't happen again. I worked with my high school's IT department in the 12th grade and is why I want to be a high school IT, I'm familiar with that environment and know that my ""boss"" is somewhere else at the board of education slaving behind a desk dealing with other issues and that it would just be me and maybe one other person or a student. So that sounds more appealing than working somewhere where I could be dragged across the floor...like the rainy day mats. nnI would say be happy until you start comparing your time there to some inanimate object that is related to company policy, like rainy day mats.

I would suggest talking to someone about this maybe a therapist or something. If you don’t already have a therapist and don’t want one ik Ik it can be scary. Especially with anxiety and talking to ppl, but there are non face to face options like online and what I do is turn the chair around so that me and my therapist cannot see each other and honestly it makes me feel like I can be myself. Sorry I don’t have a lot of advice but main point this shows you care, so you are taking the first steps necessary and it shows that this can be fixed!"
3999,"SaltsyIsScared","comment","","Hey. I’m really sorry I know I am only a 15 year old and don’t know anything but I understand you. I’ve dealt with these same feelings all of my life and the constant disappointment in myself for doing the things I do because of my anxiety. We have to remember that it is not our fault and these things are uncontrollable. It’s easy to beat yourself up trust me I know it, the blame I put on myself and the lack of understanding from others on why I do what I do. Recently I was too self conscious to go out with my friends again and had to come up with excuses. They came to my house and told me to go with them. The thing is, they did not understand this was from anxiety and it takes many forms and comes out in different ways. People sometimes will not understand, but that’s ok. I’ve found being honest with people is the best way to achieve my goals! I think it’s important for a boss or others in your workplace to become aware of these struggles. This worked for me and my teacher was able to help me through awkward situations like presentations. Let’s be real. Therapy can be F**king scary. I never wanted to go! I hate talking to people especially about embarrassing things like events that made me uncomfortable but it an be life changing!!! I know I’m young but please give therapy another go if you have already! So basically since I’m embarrassed to be face to face with someone and feel like I have to be someone else talking to them, my therapist offered to turn the chairs around so we could not see each other! This is actually a very common practice and while it can be u comfortable to talk about things it’s so so so damn useful. I promise you no matter how tough things may be right now I swear this can change! This will not be your life forever. Please try to reach out. Thank you so much and if you need someone random to talk to, even if it’s a 15 yo girl, honestly feel free to message me. nnPs: I’ve dealt with an unfortunate past and depression too. You are not alone and you never will be. There’s light at the end of this tunnel and you just need someone to help you find it. Don’t give up you will win this fight because you are a warrior and you’ve been so strong so far."

You are young and trying to figure this out on your own may not bring the best results. But a professional psychologist can help you with this and your quality of life can improve surprisingly fast. Please don’t put this off. I promise it will get better as long as you get help. I hope the best for you. Take care of yourself &lt;3"

To this day, I thought I was just uninterested in socializing but one day when I decided to make friends and talk to people, I realized I had zero skills and am super anxious. The thing that makes it all worse is that my mom tells me she thought “this was my personality”. But it wasn’t and turns out I’ve had chronic depression from a young age. I’m glad I am on my way to change and I am actively working on myself but I can’t help but wish I sought a therapist sooner."

It may take some practice but I am talking about self consciousness. nFocusing on treat only increases the presence of threat.nWhen you focus outward you will notice sth different.

4016,"missthatfaaace","comment","","I tried to talk to my parents about my anxiety when i was about 13 years old. Their response was “what do you have to be anxious about”. If the problem was addressed when I was 13, I truly believe I wouldn’t have escalated into what it is now as a 20 year old. My parents are finally starting to accept that I have depression and social anxiety but they still don’t truly understand what i’m going through. It’s frustrating. Other than that they’re great, loving parents. I also believe my mom has undiagnosed general anxiety but she’ll never get any help for it. I blame on the way my parents were raised."

4043,"t00fargone","comment","","There are many members of this community, so there are gonna be numerous posts, some you like and don’t like. But a majority of people who overcame SA probably aren’t going to be on this sub, and the people who haven’t recovered won’t be able to make those posts because they haven’t recovered. So, a majority of people here haven’t recovered, so you can’t blame them for not making posts about overcoming SA, because, well, they haven’t overcome it.nnAnd I have seen posts within the past couple of days about overcoming SA. However, nobody really comes to reddit to overcome SA. Somebody needs intensive therapy, both individual and group. Reading a post on how to overcome it or watching a video really isn’t going to be any good. That’s like telling somebody with depression to read posts or watch videos on how to overcome it, they probably won’t do any good. Same for addiction. Reading posts from people who are in recovery or watching videos isn’t going to get someone clean. They’ll need treatment. nnThis community is really a place for people to vent and talk to others who understand them. I would never go on the internet to try to find ways to overcome a disorder because frankly, it’s not that easy. I overcame SA myself and went back to school and now work as a therapist. But I had to get intensive group and individual therapy to do that. Reddit wouldn’t have done a thing. nnHowever, sometimes people on here like to have a pity party, which I believe is harming more than helping. I know, cause I used to do that before I recovered. So, I agree it makes people more comfortable to live with it and less likely to escape their comfort zone in order to recover. And yeah, the memes are annoying, but maybe that’s cus I’m in my 20s."

4057,"theshyintrovert","comment","","A idea I have for an app is an online therapy line, where people can either get free therapy or a better version but it costs money. It would be for people with suicidal thoughts who don’t want to call the lifeline, people with social anxiety or any other anxiety, people with specific phobias, eating disorders, mood disorders, etc. nI really want to make it since I could probably do most of the work at home in isolation away from people, and then I still might be able to get money. nThere’s so many people with social anxiety that are struggling in silence and at this point there just needs to be some way for people to get proper help online"
4079,"sour-soul","comment","","What about calling others scares you? For me, it's the conversation aspect. I always run out of things to say. I suffer from the blank mind syndrome, if there is one. If I have to call for routine things like say for example, pay a bill, make a doctors appointment, or order something, my anxiety damn near vanishes. That's because I know exactly what to say in those scenarios and the person on the other end isn't expecting much from me other than basic information and courtesy."

4093,"schmellix","comment","","I did two job interviews yesterday, back to back. I was very nervous but what helped me was remembering that it’s a two way street. What you think of them is just as important as what they think of you. Prepare some good questions about the job to ask them and it’ll turn into more of a conversation rather than a grilling session. Sometimes they’re even the ones who will screw up. My second interview wasn’t the greatest but that’s because the interviewer was a total d*ck who didn’t even bother to read my resume beforehand. He was burned out and didn’t care to even properly greet me or shake my hand. I, the interviewee, was close to ending the interview early and walking out on him! nnAs long as you care and put in all the effort you can then you should do just fine. If you mess up just remember that it’s a valuable learning experience and choose to grow from it. Good luck!nnI also recommend to keep putting out applications that way you won’t feel like everything is on the line and you’ll hopefully get more leads if this goes south."

I was diagnosed with PDD-NOS at a v young age too, my parents told me (and everyone else) I had it, but when I started going to high school I slowly started to realize I didn't really notice a lot of the symptoms. I did some research and found out the ones I did notice were the ones also common in social anxiety disorder. I told my parents but they didn't listen, in fact the second/third year they sent me to a 'special' school specialized in people with autism. I still go there, this is my last year.nnAt least I seem pretty normal there, not talking to anyone and not making eye contact"

4129,"runningman4776","comment","","Im sorry for your pain. Try these things as they have helped me ...nn1. Therapynn2. See a psychiatrist for meds. Nothing wrong with taking meds. Your social anxiety is crippling you nn3. Mediation (I use Waking Up app)nn4. Pray to higher power everyday for strength to endure. (Make this into a habit)nn5. Once you have been meditating for a few weeks. Begin to practice how to ACCEPT your social anxiety while it's happening. Don't try to fight it, accept it. Meditation will help in this regard. You'll feel tension. You'll feel your face getting red. You'll feel yourself sweating and unable to breath. Accept it. Tell yourself in your head ""ok, I accept"" ""I welcome my anxiety."" Because the funny thing is, when you start trying to fight your anxiety, it makes it worse. nn6. Try CBD oil. It helps with anxiety a lot. Its pricey but worth it. (I buy my CBD from Lazarus.com)"
4143,"BigBoy474","comment","","The only way is to take baby steps and expose yourself to social situations. It can take many years and don’t expect it to go away completely and I know it’s difficult. Really try to take it slow but set goals for yourself. I’m sure you’ll figure it out it just takes some time and not giving up. nnI think talk therapy and stuff just helps you find the root of the problem. Nobody really knows the root “cause” of social anxiety we just know symptoms and things that correlate with the condition. But I tell you from personal experience it can be improved over time. nnI think, at least for me, it’s a lot of irrational thoughts you need to identify the thoughts that are irrational and change them to rational thoughts. For example if you think “this person thinks I’m a total loser, I’m making a fool of myself”, try to fight these thoughts and change them with uplifting, encouraging thoughts. Think, “hey, I must not be that much a loser because he’s not laughing at me” or “hey, he’s showing me a lot of respect maybe he thinks I’m cool”nn^that stuff is not as important as just going out and talking to people. Try going to the gym or taking up a hobby where you have to be outside. Get a dog and take it out for walks. I think that keeping the exposure consistent is really important. Maybe try to aim do do something social once a week, and increase it to twice a week if you are feeling confident."
4169,"ACellarDarling","comment","","Hmm, I find talking to strangers easier actually... here’s my logic on why:nThey are not involved! But I do understand the strangness of therapy - I’m not a fan either of meeting someone for the sole purpose of talking about my problems! I’d rather let the issues unravel naturally... ironically, I think dating can help with that. Dating would be the primary purpose and talking about your life is just something that happens naturally in such a setting. In fact, I dare you, when dating, to answer honestly when they ask you how your life is going. Maybe add a ”should I be honest?” as a signal. I have found that most people want to be kind and help others, but if we don’t know the situation, we do not know how to offer help. Hope that helps,nnAn older brother. :)"
4175,"PervertSinner","comment","","Hi! I'm a social awkward introvert, as i like to call myself lol, who went through almost the same issue you are going through. During my primary school period i used to get so bullied for looking so nerdy and for being so different, thus, i became a loner which drove me all the way to social anxiety, and now that i'm 22 years old, i'm a social cripple, i can't handle a conversation and i can't feel safe expressing myself with anyone who's not really close to me.nnWhen i graduated high school, it was so difficult for me to find a good university because of i choke during the entrance interview, even though i had good grades, and during that same period many people including couple of exes took advantage of my social anxiety to mess with me and basically bully me. so i got into a depression, i refused to leave my room, i started abusing heavy drugs and i've tried to commit suicide 3 times but failed ( obviously), because commiting suicide isn't as easy as it sounds.nnNow, i can say i am depressed in silence cause of my social anxiety, i try everyday to learn social skills from observing people communicate, i even started studying communication hoping i can find that key to unlock more useful social skills, i can't say it's easy now, sometimes things can get be so awkward and overwhelming, but i try so hard to endure it and surpass it. nni really hope i said something that'll help you out my friend.  np. s : i advise you to see a psychologist just so you can get a professional's opinion also get a more legit diagnosis."
4176,"firegirl77","comment","","It sounds like you are blaming yourself a lot, and comparing yourself to others in your family when they are just different from you. Sounds like you have severe social anxiety and depression, which are disorders that you shouldn't blame yourself for!nnAlso I think moving so much as a teen can really fuck you up socially. I'm 23 and also moved a lot as a teen and child, which directly caused me a ton of social issues! Like, I was slightly shy but used to have lots of friends, and moving so much caused me to have no friends for a period of time and set me on a path of worrying a lot about social things and feeling inadequate until this day. If I had started off also being socially awkward, maybe I would have no friends. I say this because I feel like you are blaming yourself for your problems, but blaming something external like moving can make you feel better.nnAaanyway, I don't know you but if I were you I would consider going on some intensive therapy course or wilderness program if you can find one? Or psychedelics (potentially if you are comfortable)?"
4190,"cb2251","comment","","You sound so much like me when I was 16 (I’m 21 now). It breaks my heart to know someone else at that age is struggling in such close ways as I did at that time. I went to public school majority of my school years. Up until the 9th grade. My social anxiety was so overwhelming at that time that I was hiding in the bathrooms during lunch because I felt like I had no one to sit with. I didn’t talk to anyone. My only friend there was the amazing guidance counselor that worked there who really tried to help me. I got to a breaking point with it all and my parents finally decided to let my try online school. While I did online school I felt relieved because I didn’t have to deal with the heaviness and extreme anxiety that I suffered on the daily from being in public school but at the same time it made me more isolated and lonely. I lost majority of my opportunities to make friends. After doing online school for two years I ended up switching over to homeschooling. I was so lost. I gave up on trying and wasn’t doing my school work. My parents were trying everything they could to help me but you can’t help someone that doesn’t want to be helped. I graduated high school by some miracle but after that I did nothing. I didn’t pursue college. I went from job to job because my anxiety was so severe I would just quit and never go back. I was hopeless. I spent the next few years just existing until I met my current boyfriend. I moved in with him and He is the one who provides for us financially. My anxiety is so severe that it’s hard to find a job that I feel like I can handle. But I’m at a point where I need to have a job so that we can get ourselves into a better situation financially. It’s rough for me right now. My biggest piece of advice to you is to try and never give up. If you have a dream then you should pursue it. I know it’s so hard but future you will thank you for it. I regret not trying as much as I could have. I wish I had gone to college or something when I had the best chance to. I wish I had put myself out there then so that maybe now I would have more solid footing in my life. Your  life is worth something.  You are special. You are important. So treat yourself like you are. You deserve friends. You deserve every opportunity that comes your way. You deserve happiness and love and hope. I’m just now trying to get my life together from the mistakes that I made because of my fear of people and the world and I wish so badly I would have done it sooner. Take advantage of the time you have to make something of yourself. You can do anything you put your mind to. Even if it’s scary or hard. You are more than your anxieties. Don’t let that fear keep you from being who you are. I hope the best for you and your situation. Just remember that things can always be better than they are. You can always go up. Have faith in yourself and know that your anxiety is what’s causing you pain. Not who you are. So fight that anxiety. The anxiety lies and it always will. Never give up."

Be proud.nnI want to share my story with you and will answer your questions as good as i can.nI remember having some sort of social anxiety/heavier shyness from the Start of my very beginning as a human being. in Kindergarten.nWith years it started to get worse because my parents and my teacher always told me that i was too quiet. nAnd as a little Kid you will someday believe what the olders say to you. I have an older sister who is actually the complete opposite of me. nWith all the comparing and complaining i began to think that something must be wrong with me. Plus The self-esteem i didn't evelope got the better of me.nWe didn't had a healthy family either and thanks to my fully developed social anxiety At that point i got mobbed at school too. Not to mention the presentations i was forced to held in school.nAnd i think you can relate to that: i isolated myself from making new friends. I couldn't even order food or anything in person. Or have ""just"" fun like the issues you described in point 1 to 10. My life was affected 10/10 for me any day any time.nnMusic was my friend for MANY years. It calmed me down and it still is.nAfter school i forced myself to to a job in a social field for a year. And it helped a bit. nAfter that i met my (now ex)bf and he showed me for the First time that it is okay to be different and introverted  cause he was also that way and he didn't forced me to go to any social Meeting i didn't want to go.his family didn't took it that well. With him around it was only a 7/10 .nWhen he broke up with me (he  actually had some talking issues) i realized that my anxiety got better but i never reached out to someone else in that time. Kind of isolated myself with him. And had no actually friends at that time just my best friend.nGot my ass up then and began to Talk to my old friends and  the people i got to know through time. nnSo i can relate to you a LOT. now it is like a 4/10 and i Think it will never go away fully. Once in a while I push past my Limits/anxiety to Show myself that i can do it And to gradually open up to my family and friends. point 15 feels like home. Maybe it is that :canceling plans at the Last minute  why people don't reach out to us so often.nnMy bad selftalk is also going in my way a lot recently like in point 12 for you. And i have to convince myself if they have an issue with me or dont like what i say or what opinions i have they will Talk to me. and i  especially asked them to tell me when they dont feel like friends anymore. So it is their Problem when they get annoyed of me and wont go. I wouldnt stop them.nI don't Talk to them everyday but i think it is more about the quality  not the amount of friends you have. It is said that one will have only two really close friends in a lifetime. nnNo i wasn't Diagnosed with social anxiety and i think i have some sort of depression now and then because of my past/bad selftalk i got from my childhood and because i am anxious about what will happen with my worklife  now. And it is also get triggered when i see someone make friends with ease it Shows me what i somehow lack. And this feeling is horrible.n i know where i got it and i wished i had some help back then from a therapist or actually my parents so i dont have that much  to catch up on. (I am 25) n(Did you find out  what triggered yours?)nAnd i feel like i missed so much because of social anxiety and it is difficult to me to stay in the positiv mindset. But now that the anxiety is not that bad anymore i feel a lot of Wanderlust.nnAs i got older i also cared less and less about what people think of me. But there is a quote for that as well that makes me go easier through life:nYou will always be the bad guy in someone else's story . So take it easy you won't be able to get everyone on your side. As sweet as a peach could be there is always someone who hates them. No i haven't told anyone except my sister and my closest friend and the  people who have it too. I just don't care anymore what the ""others"" would say about it. nnTo your 13: it is wonderful that you want to ""heal"" First or work on yourself before you get in a serious relationship. I wished more people would listen to themselves First rather searching for their happiness in other people. Should have done that myself years ago :/nMake yourself happy First than the happiness will come to you.even when it is just accepting yourself. I hope we both get to that point some day. nBut who am i to say that. I  have a long road to Walk too and i am neither a wise old woman nor an ancient god who knows everything. (I'm not religious)nnTo get further in Progress i want to go to a therapist this year or next depends on when i get an appointment. Maybe it will help maybe not i will try anything. nKnowing  myself a little bit better helped me too. Do you know 16personallities? You can take the test for free maybe you find yourself in one of those descriptions. Don't know if you know it already or if you believe in this. n nAnd the point with the talking only about yourself or be narcistic.

4258,"DeadEndMyBoi","comment","","Is there something in particular that happens whenever you meet new people? What causes every attempt you make to reach out fail? There is a possibility that you're just not finding the right people to vibe with. That doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you. If there are no in-person communities that match with your interests, try joining online communities that do. Online friends might not be the same as having irl friends, but at least it will help to keep the loneliness at bay. nnI know its really, really, REALLY hard, but you have to learn to love yourself. You have to. Its a cliche saying, but it is true that if you don't love yourself, it is likely that others won't either. If you don't love yourself, every rejection will hurt twice as much because you'll feel as though that rejection only solidifies how you feel about yourself. nnHow do you do love yourself? It's not going to happen overnight, obviously. Start with the little steps. Keep a journal of the things you do and thoughts you have every day, record both the good and the bad. Look back on it and reflect. How did you feel about what the lady at the supermarket said to you? Did it make you feel happy or upset? Why? Analyzing why you think or feel a certain way helps you get a good look at yourself. It works better than looking in a mirror, trust me. And most importantly, remember that every single thought you have is valid. Even if you think it's ""wrong"" or feel you ""shouldn't think this way"", it's *valid* . Chances are, there are several others who have had every bad thought you have or screwed up as much as you did, sometimes people you'd least expect.nnOr, alternatively, pick up a hobby. It could be anything related to your interests. You don't have to be perfect, but do it to the best of your ability. The point is to be comfortable with your own company and gain a skill that you can associate yourself with when talking with people. nnDon't give up now, you still have a ways to go in life! There are so many options out there. I was once in the same pit you were in, but I got out. And I didn't rely on anyone but myself. Sometimes I struggle with myself now and again, but all I need is a second or two to reflect and stop myself from spiraling downwards. To remind myself that there's a good to every bad, the sun will shine tomorrow, and the only end to everything in life is death. Times are hard, but we have to make due with what we have. I'm sure most of those upvotes and these comments are by people who have all been or are in a similar situation. Just remember that you're never alone. You can perservere and get through this, like so many others and I have. nnAlso, is there a reason why therapy isn't helping?"
4259,"DeadEndMyBoi","comment","","If people treated you like an outcast just for being confident in yourself, then it sounds like they're just projecting their insecurities onto you. I find that some people will hate confident people because they can't be confident themselves. And if there's a hivemind of insecure and bitter people, then they will try to make you feel like the odd one instead of them, as is usually the case with bullies and internet trolls. I also find that in a school setting, conformity is prevalent and anyone who acts outside of the norm is looked down upon. I understand why this would make you feel like that, and I know it will be hard to overcome this fear. Just remember that how people judge and react to others stems from how they view themselves and the world. I've also observed this in myself too, whenever I become depressed I tend to view the world and others negatively, which does nothing for me but make me feel even worse. And I've seen this exact pattern of behavior in those around me and even online. It's sad there are people who consistently behave this way without being self-aware, but there's nothing we can do about it if they refuse to get better. We just have to look out for ourselves and the people we care for. nnAwesome! Yes, looking inwards and discovering yourself can be an amazing journey. It is important that you come to understand yourself without too much external judgement, but at the same time don't feel ashamed or hesitant to reach out to others for help and advice. We all get stuck sometimes! If I may recommend, r/motivation and r/DecidingToBeBetter are two subs with great daily posts about this sort of stuff and will offer optimistic views and advice. If you're interested in meditation, that is also a great technique that will help with managing anxiety and give you a clearer headspace. And these are just a few of the many self help options out there. You just have to find and utilize what works best for you.nnI'm glad that it did, and I'm happy to have helped! Wishing you the best of luck! :)"
4262,"thefuckingicequeen","comment","","My therapist could tell that I got really anxious everytime there was an awkward pause or lull in the convo. He would suggest we practice sitting in silence for a long time until eventually it didn't bother me as much. I would suggest maybe bringing it up with him, that it makes you anxious when that happens and maybe you guys can work out a way to overcome it."
4267,"lolboll12","comment","","My guess would be that the people you talked to either missed the mark or sucked ass. The downside of that industry is that, ironically, many of the pros you go and see are nutcases themselves, and actually finding people that understand you can take time. It took me many years to find someone that could take care of me properly. Don’t give up; I promise that there’s solutions to these things. Whether it’s by proper therapy, medication or meditation. If it helps in any way, I know how you feel, and I’m with you. I experienced hard abuse from my parents and bullying as a child. My life has been hell on earth. I truly sympathize with you.

You are probably more likely to get further with the right therapist than with meds. There is definitely no magic pill, though it's also worth a shot as meds effectiveness varies person to person and the side effects are mild if there are any at all.

You can't control when people will come in or out of your life, so you should worry about what you CAN control. You can control how you can take care of your mental health by seeking help. That's all you can do."

I remember my freshman year I was so nervous to present this presentation about a book in English, that I actual went to my doctor got her to sign me a note to send to my teacher. He told me I could present to him after school alone. I then had to go to a therapist that my doctor sent me to but personally it did nothing for me. I’m just glad high school is over and my program in college doesn’t really require a whole lot of presenting. Thank god."
4281,"TactilePope94","comment","","I'm in almost exactly the same boat. I turn 26 this May. I've had bad social anxiety my whole life. I was tested as a kid and they did not diagnose me with ASD, but I was diagnosed with GAD and social anxiety. Just a few months ago I decided to get another psychological evaluation done (insurance covered most of it thankfully), as I felt that there were things ""off"" about me socially that couldn't be explained only by social anxiety. After a lot of tests, this time they diagnosed me with it. The testing process and diagnostic criteria have changed a lot over the years. Ultimately learning this didn't change much for me. It's just a label after all. But it was good to finally get an explanation after all these years.  I don't know if you would be diagnosed if you were to get tested again but it is worth looking into."
4282,"Tandem-soli","comment","","I feel like this is a very common problem among people with social anxiety (I mean, any social situation is common with socially anxious people, but this one more so) because it's one of those scenarios where you just don't know what to say! nnI don't know how common of a cause this is, but my reason has always been because I grew up in a poor family. My mother could never afford to send me to the hair dressers often. So the person who cut my hair? My mum. And occasionally my nan. How could someone possibly learn the social protocol in a scenario that they've never been in? nnI've been to therapy for social anxiety, and one of the things that I was always told was to do things with family or friends first along side you, that way you can have them as a safety net in case things go wrong or awkwardly. They can also tell you what you didn't do and what to do differently next time to make things easier. Not only that, but you may need to be open to your friends and family about the anxiety and simply ask them what they would say when they walked into a hair dressers themselves. Practice and planning makes things like this a lot easier in these situations for me and I hope it would for you (or anyone who may be reading) as well. nnI hope I helped a little. Let me know if you want to ask anything else on the topic!"

When I tell him that for the last 5 years nothing makes me happy anymore he said “try and find more things that make you happy” and I told him how I get depressed because I’m not close with my family and he literally said “what’s the chances you could build  a relationship with them?” ..... he completely forgot that I told him my uncle molested me when I was 11 and my whole family took his side.. so yeah no chance on rebuilding a relationship like what therapist forgets that... to cope with being lonely I daydream a lot and it’s called maladaptive daydreaming which isn’t a diagnosable disorder yet :/ but I created a whole fictional world in my head that for he last 5 years I’ve preferred over real life... and I told him I genuinely feel like part of me belongs there and I feel like the fictional characters are my friends.. and he doesn’t see an issue with it... only thing I’ve been diagnosed with is social anxiety and depression:/ I want a new dr but I feel like they’ll say the same thing :/ is being a parent with social anxiety hard? I’m worried for that one day... how can I be a parent if I’m so shy:/ feel like I’ll be judged for it"
4294,"lowknees","comment","","I've just finished my third year, and I live with two of my best friends who I met in college. nnI felt exactly like you're feeling, it's a really big change and it's totally fine to feel nervous about it. But there are some great campus resources you should utilize to help make that transition smoother.nnFirst thing I did was go to school counselling, and even get an official diagnosis for social anxiety. They put me on meds, which can be tricky to do adjust to at first while youre also managing school, but can be really helpful. Usually your school will offer free counselling sessions as well that you can sort of substitute for therapy.nnI got really lucky in my first year, because I found someone who was outgoing and approached me first. But it's as easy as finding something in common with anyone in your classes. Whether you have more than one class with them, or youre in the same program, etc etc, making that first move and talking to people can open up a lot of opportunity for friendships later. nnJoining clubs can jumpstart you on finding a group of people who you mesh with. Having that common interest and preplanned activities can help you make that initial connection.nnMy advice is also to doing things with people! It may seem so easy to use school as an excuse to stay in and study, but doing things with people, like going to see a movie or going out for a pub night can help you get to know people better, and vice versa. Or if thats not your thing, form a study group with people! Get your course work, go to a library or cafe together and spend the afternoon working together. nnIt can be daunting at first, but don't beat yourself up about it. Just try and keep a positive, open attitude and you'll be fine! Remember there are a lot of other people like you who are new to this too. Good luck, I hope it's a rewarding experience for you!"
4297,"Tandem-soli","comment","","Like others have already posted, it's hard to put an exact year on it. I didn't speak until I was 2.5 years old, and everyone my mother knew said that I was ""glued to her hip"" as a child when we went out (but this may be related to Asperger's Syndrome rather than directly to my social anxiety). I was bullied in every school I went to, but started noticing the serious effects that SA was having on me when I first started college at 17. Shortly after that was when I started going to therapy."
4310,"thatreadyfeeling","comment","","I had this experience when I got my license! I'd actually been driving alone with my permit a lot and I think the anxiety of knowing that was illegal messed me up, so then ironically when I got my license (at like 17) and it was finally legal, I was terrified ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ nnI ended up convincing my mom to let me go to a counselor for it; I only had like 3-4 appointments but a flip switched or something and the anxiety wasn't as bad. nnI can't say it completely went away to be honest though. Now, at 24, I'm rarely relaxed in a car lol. People seem to be able to just tune out the fact that they're moving 70-80mph, I've never understood that. I'm always thinking ""Jesus, if she flinches we will both die."" But, if it helps, I do drive pretty much daily and it's not a big source of anxiety for me anymore, so it can definitely get better"
4315,"Tandem-soli","comment","","It's hard to say. I don't think you ever overcome social anxiety, you just get better at dealing with it. I've had times where I think I've made amazing progress and haven't had an anxious moment in months, but the truth was really that I got into a routine of avoidance and planning out all of the social interactions that I knew were coming. When one caught me off guard, all of those feelings came rushing back. nnI will say though that I've become a much better person than I could ever have imagined through trying to improve myself. You haven't said how old you are, but I'm 23 if that helps. I had therapy when I was 16-17 and the best advice was planning and first doing things with someone like a friend or family with you to use as a safety net in case things go wrong, then slowly work your way up to doing it by yourself. This really helped me get better at new things that I hadn't done and having to interact with new people that I hadn't before. nnBut things still get me. I'm forever planning out every conversation in my mind before it happens, thinking of conversation starters, repeating lines to myself over and over whilst in line to see someone in the shop (before covid that is) and there are still a lot of things I just will not to, and would severely panic if I was forced into them or caught of guard which has happened. nnI'd say just take everyday one at a time, and keep trying to comfortably push yourself against the box before fully leaping out of your comfort zone. It doesn't matter how long it takes, as long as you keep trying and keep making progress, no matter how small."
4346,"thatonefoo310","comment","","I’ve been there trust me. I’ve worked in Many places and I always was shunned out but for the reason that I was a quiet guy. Honestly I had to work on myself to even begin to start talking to people because I would be terrified of any confrontation.  I have 1 friend and I could say close friend because she is my only one. But she does accept me for being that quiet guy when all I needed was a bit of a push and I’m comfortable to the point where I’m not even scared to talk to her. But before that I would always put myself down saying I was fat, ugly, disgusting and that no one will ever like me cause I was a slob and shy and for a while I felt like it was true because making friends was hard for me. All my guy acquaintances would just make fat jokes , even today when I see them around the city they still bring up when I was fat even though now I’ve lost a ton of weight. Losing weight helped my confidence along with realizing I didn’t need people’s acceptance to be happy, now I can be in my room alone without feeling lonely all the time. I’m no psychiatrist or anything just by experience, being 25 and still shy is sad but I know im slowly getting over it because I will!"
4361,"SadBoiHours62","comment","","Ive been in therapy and meds for only like 6-ish months now, so I'm still pretty fresh to the whole deal and can still remember what my beginning experience was like. nnIn terms of therapists, there's a chance that the first one isnt right for you, and that's perfectly okay! But it's good if you really give them a fair shot. I remember being incredibly scared my first time going into her office. I stuttered, rambled, was clamy, heart beat pretty fast, thought like I was annoying her with every word (social anxiety amirite?) But what I did to alleviate that was SAY that you're feeling this way. In the moment. Right now. They'll most likely try to calm your fears right away. They know that therapy can be a scary experience at first and will try to make it as comfortable as possible (and will tell you that you're not annoying them lol). nnIve had 2 therapists in my time, one was pretty good and the other one was not as good. Even with the therapist was not as good, it still gave me someone to talk to, which imo is better than nothing. And don't hesitate to tell them if you feel that this isn't working out after a few sessions. This isnt some sort of ""break up"" they're professionals. They'll understand and try to give you recommendations for different people in their practice if available. They won't take it personally, I promise.nnThis is getting a little long so I'll give you a brief rundown on meds. Going to the doctor in the first place before all of this therapist stuff happened was very nerve wracking for me. But They won't try to be your therapist, its simply not their field (or at least they shouldn't try). They pretty much want your symptoms and how long you've experienced them. They've most likely have had many people come in for mental health problems, so this is just an everyday occurrence for them. Meds can be weird. I was on Citalopram for a bit, kinda sucked. Then I went to Buspar, didn't suck at first but is kind of sucking now. Just keep at it really, and just like therapists, give the meds a fair shot and remember to take them when they said to take it. Some Meds won't do anything unless theyve been in your system for a certain amount of time.nnSorry this went on a little long but I hope this helps!"
4381,"depressed_autistic","comment","","If you have the time please try and read all of this. Im not the best with words or explaining stuff but i would really appreciate  it.nnIm autistic and all of my brothers are to some degree. Plus my mother is a child psychologist and has lots of friends who are child psychologists. So id like to think i know quite a bit about mental health.nnIm 19 and was only diagnosed with autism about a year and a half ago. It was at the same time as i was diagnosed with social anxiety and generalised anxiety and depression. However i had known i had been suffering from anxiety and depression for years before that i had just been really against recieving any help as i felt it was me being weak and i was a lost cause so what was the point.nnMy mum always had a suspicion that i might be autistic, but then she had alot of experience with it what with her being a child psychologist. But i had never even thought about it. In fact i really doubted it because i just didnt think i had any traits of it (idk if traits is the right word but thats what im going with) nnTo me, it felt like all my problems were to do with anxiety and depression and i couldnt possibly be autistic. But i have learnt something. PEOPLE WITH AUTISM ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION (especially in girls) . A lot of autistic people struggle to read emotions and when it comes to social situations they just miss a lot of stuff, and thats where the anxiety comes from be it social or any other kind. nnAutistic brains are wired differently plain and simple. And because of that your brain is more likely to recieve impulses related to anxiety and is often fight or flight mode. And its why autistic people tend to prefer maths based subjects because their brains are wired to think logically and will miss the more grey area of say english lessons where you have to analyse texts.nnAlso the hair thing is quite possibly i sign. Alot of autistic people struggle with sensory things. So personally i have never been able to tie my hair up (like into a ponytail or plaits or anything) i dont know why its just makes me feel really uncomfortable and it would literally reduce me to tears when i was younger and i had to tie my hair up for school sports. So i always cut my hair every couple months so it didnt go past my shoulders (as my school rules where that you had to tie your hair up if it went past your shoulders) nnI also cant deal with things around my neck so when my school introduced lanyards that was really difficult to try and explain to them that having a lanyard round my neck was so horrible for me and made me feel ill at times. But actually my school were really good about it and after a bit of digging their heels in they eventually just dropped the issue. (Though they were also aware that i was dealing with a whole lot of issues both mentally and family wise, and the probably realised it was better for me to be in school and learning without a lanyard than to be at home too depressed to leave my bed. Which is what the previous two years had been like.nnI hope this is helpful in somewhere. I know ive probably rambled a bit, but i find it useful to give to much infomation sometimes as it helps get some of the anxious thoughts out of my head.nn Also your first step is probably, (if you can i know a lot of mental health services even in developed countries like the US and the UK can be really hard to access) is to get some form of diagnosis whether it be one of autism or anxiety, though i think people are more reluctant to diagnose adults with autism. But to be honest any diagnosis will help, because if nothing else it will put your mind to rest a bit. nnI know for me, my mental health, (whilst still not brilliant) definitely improved after i got my diagnoses because it helped me stop worrying about self-diagnosing myself but  it will help you make sure you get the correct support. For example someone with social anxiety might be treated using CBT however if it turns out you do have autism then CBT might not work for you. I dont really know the details of it but basically because of how CBT is done, it doesnt really take into account the autistic brain and how an autistic person sees and processes emotions differently. Also a lot of CBT therapists arent trained in or very aware of autism and so it woukd be better to have a therapist that specialises in autism. That be said obviously any therpist is better than no therapist. Plus it might turn out that your not autistic anyway."
4415,"gunnerCKY","comment","","Hey man you'd be surprised by just how much you could change in 3 months if you made an effort. I started seeing a therapist when I was around 19. I had just finished highschool and dropped out of uni and was feeling exactly like this. For a few months all I did was go to therapy once a week. Even taking a cab was a nightmare. After a while things just started coming together. I came across Jordan Peterson on youtube and sorta became more spiritual. I'm 21 now, and studying psychology in my second year and things are a lot better. Even though I've still got a ways to go, I've had days where I felt super human. I'm talking speaking to strangers left and right and being really confident. The thing is there's always gonna be an up and down. Some days are going to be insanely good where as others are going to be insanely dark. Don't beat yourself up and believe me when I tell you that even the most relaxed, confident people have days where they will feel and even act like the biggest weebs in the world. What you have to do is put your best foot forward and try to live a good life. TRY YOUR BEST. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday and not who someone else is today."

However, you are 14, which unfortunately means that your feelings are easy to dismiss or undermine as ""teenage hormones"", or a phase. And unfortunately, you can't advocate for your own health yet.nnAnd for the most part, all of these anxieties are normal! Especially when you're in a transitional phase of your life. The question for you to ask yourself is, are these anxieties preventing you from enjoying your life, finding sucess in school, and making and keeping meaningful relationships in your life? To me, it sounds like maybe they are. nnAnd if that's true, there are ways to get help. You can have that conversation with your parents, see your GP, and talk about diagnosis and treatments. Even if this is something you will grow out of, getting professional help, even temporarily, is nothing to be ashamed or feel bad about, if it can improve the way you're feeling now.nnIf that seems way too scary and intimidating now, (I've been there, it took me untill college to make that step), there are still resources for you. nnThere are many things online that can help you cope with your anxiety. You might have to try a couple of different things out to find out what helps you the best.nnOne of them is called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT. In simple terms, its a method of journaling. There are youtube videos, websites, printable worksheets, and mobile apps. Even just starting out keeping a basic journal might be helpful to you.nnEven if you feel unsure that this is ""real"" social anxiety, these tools are for everyone. You don't need an official club membership, or some kind of pass. But if youre struggling, you don't have to grin and bear it. Introverted or not, there are ways to enjoy socialization again."

Yes most men talk about what you called “the basic 4. because those are four super generic categories almost every man alive can relate to. If you can’t, you’re probably gay n5.

I have no idea how gay guys make friends with straight guys. If you don’t have similar hobbies then why would you want to hang out with a straight guy unless it was to try some gay shit? n7. Don’t be a boring, do nothing-know nothing person. Guys like to vibe with similar energies. If you have a shitty personality or you’re so overwhelmed by anxiety that you can’t say much, see a doctor because that’s not normal. n8. Men literally live and breath competition. What’s fun about a video game or sport if there is no competitive aspect of it? I guess if you had a friend over you couple play co-op story modes on some games but that shit’s so easy it probably wouldn’t be fun for the other guy. If you suck at online games just keep playing and you’ll get better. n9. Of course those guys stopped talking to you when you sent them your schedule, that SCREAMS commitment and honestly sounds like you’re trying to plan a date, which goes back to the whole gay thing. n10.

I want to commend you for trying therapy for 6 months, it shows that you are willing to try and committed to overcoming this. It is hard when every instinct tells you to panic or be self-conscious when interacting with people. It is especially hard when it seems to come so easy to others and tends to be expected. I just want to say I am not sure if any of us will ever be the most outgoing talkative person who makes friends and doesn't break promises but that is OK! I am sure you are wonderful person and just because it feels like you are at a loss for what to do it doesn't mean you aren't still growing and improving each day. Sometimes it doesn't feel that way but don't give up it is a life-long marathon and there are going to be some bad days but there are definitely going to be some good days.nnFor a bit of background on me I am a 25 yo male. I get nervous all the time. Meeting new people, reconnecting with people I care for (quarantine is not helping), public presentations, walking literally anywhere (I am overweight so I am super self-conscious about that), expressing serious feelings, making phone calls or texts...the list goes on. However, I would like to say to that it has gotten better over the years. Despite all of the things that make me nervous I am functional (arguably lol). My anxiety was never as hard hitting as yours so take anything I say with a grain of salt. nnKeep working at it and as shitty as it sounds try to get out of your comfort zone. I definitely think you should also be able to take some time to yourself if you are going through tough times but when you are ready try making small changes. If there is anyone you are comfortable talking to (for me its my mom) practice with them. Be open and ask for advice. Social anxiety sucks but being able to speak to people, make phone calls, communicate effectively are skills which means they can be practiced and learned. For me it was middle school when one of my teachers decided it was important that we all make posters and share about our lives in front of the whole class. I tried faking being sick, mysteriously had to use the bathroom when my turn was coming up, so many excuses but in the end I had to do it. I froze, I stumbled, I muttered, but it happened and I was told it wasn't that bad. I made some comments (weren't necessarily jokes but whatevs) and people laughed not at me but with me. Overall, it was a surprisingly positive experience. I still panicked like a MOTHERFUCKER (please excuse the language) afterwards and am clearly still thinking about it today around 12 years later. However, my teacher was suppourtive, gave me feedback, and encouraged me to keep trying. I am not great at public speaking but I have done it quite a bit since. The point I wanted to make is that while I still have anxiety I was encouraged to take a positive experience and build on it. As horrible as I am at public speaking it was a skill I was able to practice and develop and what was a weakness became not necessarily a strength but something I have developed confidence in and it has led to opportunties for me. nnI hope you can take some time to yourself to recover and reflect on some of the good things you do. It doesn't have to be about social skills at all. If you got up today and put on pants (its an accomplishment these days if you ask me) you have done at least one good thing. If you have someone you trust and feel comfortable with say hi. Low pressure situations are great way to build up confidence imo. Take it slow, it is ok if you don't meet all your goals today. You are still growing and you are work in progress no matter if you are 9 years old, 19,  or 99. I hope you reach out and try to pursue therapy again if that is what you want. It may take some time to find the right people and the right approach but we are all hoping you find it. Lastly, I hope you have a great day and don't let this keep you down (YOU CAN DO IT :) !!!!!!)nnAlso...my bad for this super long winded comment. In addition, I am sure there are some spelling/grammatical mistakes but I hope the message gets to you and is positive!"
4626,"shatterlatter","comment","","Wow, that's pretty much me exactly, except it's my younger sister who is the \~top of her class perfect child\~. I'm not really in much of a place to give you advice, but talk therapy and medication might be helpful. My social anxiety and general anxiety used to be a lot worse before I started taking medication. I was opposed to it at first, but sometimes you need a little help in order to make positive change. Extreme example: Someone who is too anxious to even go grocery shopping can't even work on it because any and all social interaction is too much. A little medical help can make it possible for you to slowly work on improving your social skills and develop strategies for dealing with social anxiety, preferably with the guidance of a therapist.nnI know I preach all this but I literally JUST made a post about being miserable and feeling hopeless, but honestly it used to be a lot worse. Sometimes I get moments where I feel like this, but most of the time I feel better. I think the whole covid and isolation situation is making me feel worse about myself in general. Sometimes I feel hopeless, but I know that I can get better even if it seems impossible. I've gone through other mental health problems as well that were insanely difficult, and I literally thought I would die before I worked through them, but here I am. My life is not a waste, and neither is yours. This sucks, but it won't necessarily last forever."
4631,"Frodo_Of_Rivia","comment","","I wasn't given any prescription medications but I was offered CBT. So far I'm starting to leave my house few times before going back in if it's intense. This is the early sessions, if it gets worse they'll try different methods. From where I live, they won't prescribed you with pills, which is unfortunate and I'm planning to switch my therapist to another one."
4641,"mayz576","comment","","I think your outlook and motivation to improve will get you soo far. I'd say that's the best thing you could possibly have to be able to defeat your anxiety. It seems like you are very observant and are very aware of what you are feeling and why, which is also important. The advice I would give you is based on my experience of anxiety, so it may not be best for you. I'm 19 and have always been very motivated to get myself out of my anxiety, which has actually been very successful over the last few years. The main thing that helped me was CBT and I honestly cannot recommend it enough. I think with your awareness of how you are feeling you would be very good at this kind of therapy, as it is about realising your negative thinking patterns and actively changing them with your therapist, in it's simplist terms. I think therapy would be the best thing for you to do in your situation, I often wish I had discovered CBT earlier as it has done me wonders. I hope this helps, if you have any more questions I'm happy to help :)"
4642,"mayz576","comment","","Honestly, I've done this so many times. I used to be so ashamed of myself and would worry so much about telling my family or my therapist because I 'failed' at something. I'm 19. I've gone to interviews then declined job offers, done my first shift and not gone back, been for a couple of shifts then bailed. I started looking for jobs in 2018 so this happened over the last couple of years. Anyway, I wouldn't beat yourself up about it too much, I used to tell myself that I just jumped ahead too far, and I should dial it back a bit and try something slightly more within my current capabilities. So I started volunteering for an animal shelter (literally the SCARIEST thing I've ever tried to commit to in my life) but I'm still there two years later, I don't know all the people that work there still. I've done a couple of volunteer things since then, among all the jobs I bailed on! My point is, just keep trying, as cliched as it sounds. One day you may find you can push yourself a little bit further and do the interview, but not do the job, and then in the future have the confidence to actually turn up to a new job etc. It does get better honestly, just keep trying. It's so hard and shitty but don't beat yourself up for not doing something, and the most important thing is to remember that it doesn't matter how slow you take things."
4693,"hambone2101","comment","","Yes I do, and it's become the absolute bane of my existence. As I'm sure you know, you can't really emphasise how bad it is to someone who doesn't have one, but its seriously just the world's most shitty thing. My stutter is really quite bad, every sentence I utter there will be a point not even 3 words in where I'll get stuck halfway through a word, or not be able to start one. And I sound like such a fucking idiot going ""b-b-b-b-b"" for up to 5 or 10 seconds and either you give up or someone just talks over you. And there's nothing wrong with your thought process, the sentence forms clearly in your head, but once it comes to talking, it's near impossible. nnI've had mine as long as I can remember, and since my SA has gotten worse, the stutter has gotten worse as well. In fact, I'm sure it's played a major part in the reason I developed SA in the first place, I just stopped talking to people to avoid embarrassment or being teased (which has happened more times than I can count). Along with that, my self esteem has also taken a nose dive. I've tried speech therapy a few times but nothing seems to work. I honestly just want it gone, it's dragging my entire life down."
4705,"xjrsc","comment","","I had my first job at 16 as a paper boy. A first job is a step we all need to make eventually and I believe that I 16/17 is a good age to begin . IMO 20hrs or less per week is really good for a teen. They get their own spending money, and they meet knew people with different perspectives on life and ways to do things.nnI'm making steps to better my life because of people I've met at work. I never would've seen a doctor for SA or depression if it wasn't for my co worker. I never would've taken grade 12/11 summer/night school at 20 if it was for another co worker. I never would've asked out a girl if it wasn't for encouragement from a coworker.nnIf you're worried about school then I can understand, but when I was 16 I was getting mediocre grades so its not like I was trying much to begin with (I thought I was doing my best but in reality I was slacking).  Be honest with yourself, are you using the time you would be working studying or being better in some way?nnIf you're worried about SA affecting your work performance then again I can understand but from my experience, from a paper boy, to cashier, to sales, to manager, to sales again, customers are the least of my worries. They want something, I give it to them. If I cant help, I offer them someone who can. There is very little thought towards customers I know alot of people can relate to that feeling. I only find issues regarding SA arise in the break room where at my current job I'm kinda expected to socialize which ends up triggering alot of anxiety but that's a separate issue that isn't related to the job, its a sickness.nnYou can also use a job towards your health. At my place of work, part timers receive benefits after a certain amount of time employed. I used the benefits towards paying my prescription for anti-depressants although benefits vary depending on the job.nnIf she hasn't already, take her to a clinic and have her explain to the doctor how she feels. In Canada I can just walk in anytime, I'm not sure what the states are like when it comes to that especially for a minor. nnSA/Depression wont go away on its own it requires alot of effort from her and you are in a position where you can significantly help her."

4727,"TheDr259","comment","","I left my therapist for similar reasons.nnHe wanted me to ask people in stores how their days were going and stuff like that. But I just think, who even asks that? Don't people go to the store to buy what they need and go back to whatever they need to do. I would feel weird if someone started talking to me while I'm trying to buy groceries. Also, how can you make conversation during this time? I think it's useless. You're supposed to stay away from people. nnAnd whenever I felt like I socialized, even if it was small, I felt pretty good. My therapist said I wasn't ready, so I should just move on to talk about some other issue, if I had any others. He said that if I wasn't going to try, I should just stop. He wanted me to just dive in and be SOCIAL. I don't know about anyone else, but it's very hard for me to just BE social. I think a small step is a bug accomplishment and I don't care if I never cure/reduce my social anxiety. There are some positives to it and I love it, it defines who I am.nnIs it just me thinking that it's hard to find a good therapist or psychologist? I've had like 2, but I never really felt like I got a lot out of it. If only I could talk to someone about every thought I think lol."

4742,"P_Foot","comment","","21M here. I also feel like I do everything awkward comparatively. Like I mess up more often or fumble too much.nnHowever after a lot of therapy and medicine I’ve started to realize that even though I was stumbling more than other people (from being nervous of that fact) nobody would pay any attention. People are so worried about themselves, and that’s not a bad thing necessarily.nnNext time you feel like you’re doing something stupid or you did something stupid, try to think about a time you saw someone else in public do something stupid. Then think about how little time you actually spent thinking “wow what a weird guy” and how quickly you forgot. This gives two effects: makes you remember that other humans mess up and that nobody remembers things of that nature about other people that long"
4756,"dessertismyfav","comment","","You probably won’t find an expert on here so It would be best to talk to your doctor about it and see if you can get therapy. I know they can teach you techniques to help you. I live in the USA so unfortunately it’s something that I will have to save up money for and even then I’m not sure I’d be able to go many sessions because it’s so expensive. What I usually do is watch motivational videos to put myself in a positive mindset. I also read about people who also have had panic attacks and see how they deal with anxiety in general, they usually have a lot of good tips that can also apply to social anxiety. Meditation can help a lot if you do it consistently enough. Putting yourself out there can help with the right mindset, but even then I still struggle sometimes. I’m still learning to accept that SAD is a part of my personality. I used to be embarrassed about it, but lately I’ve been telling people that I deal with anxiety around social situations and so far all of my friends and family have been supportive and understanding. One of the biggest things that helps me is positive self talk. The kinder I am to myself, the less stressed I am about having anxiety. This is just my personal experience. I’m not sure that what works for me will work for everyone. I highly encourage you to try going to a doctor or therapist first if you have that option. :)"
4761,"shinjixo","comment","","Mine definitely got more worse as an adult. I’m also 22 and because I have social anxiety, I find it difficult to take care of myself. I’d suggest taking medication like Zoloft as it made me feel more energized and I can now maintain somewhat of a good sleeping schedule. At the end of the day dealing with SA is life-altering but the world cannot stop for you. You have to move on with life. If money is not an issue the obvious thing to do for long term would be therapy, but I found that it’s pretty easy for me to figure out the root of my problems (insecurities of how one looks whether physically or intellectually ), so I write things down and try and look for solutions to combat these problems. I had a weight issue but with SA obviously I don’t like being in the gym, so I tried jump roping from the confines of my own home. I always had questions about big picture stuff (as one gets because dealing with SA means always having negative thoughts) so I thought I’d start reading philosophy. A lot of people don’t understand what living with SA is like and how crazy it is that I have difficulty answering phone calls and texts, going to stores or even meeting deadlines. Things like this that you see other people do so easily that to them they cannot comprehend it. So to answer your question, medication definitely helps and journal a lot. Self help books catered towards people with SA would help as well. I feel very lucky to have this subreddit to know that I am not alone with what I am dealing with. I hope it makes you feel the same."

4780,"opalserpant","comment","","Alcohol is a horrible drug to use to help with social anxiety. Assuming you've tried therapy and other ways of helping social anxiety, there are other drugs to help with social anxiety that are better than alcohol. Phenubit, kratom, visceral are some of many. Phenubit is probably the most hardcore, and visceral is the least. You have to know if you have an addictive personality and need self discipline before trying phenubit and kratom. Kratom and phenubit are legal online in most places, and visceral you need a prescription"

4822,"rlynbook","comment","","Sometimes talking with a stranger is very scary at first. Then it seems like what you were missing. They will not judge you or degrade you - they are only there to listen and help you. Talking to your family is very hard, it took me close to 20 years to open up about what I go through. I was afraid they wouldn’t understand or like me less because it is just hard for me some days. They still don’t completely understand but they try and they never make me feel bad for how I am. In fact they find ways to make me happier too now.nnI am the same way with phone calls and video chats, I find texts and face-to-face easier for me. A good therapist will still see you face-to-face even with the pandemic going on, and will understand if you feel more comfortable being able to text to them. I recommend finding one that deals with DBT, it has helped me a lot with learning how to handle situations and feelings - more than just talking about it. Also meditation helps a lot, concentrating on your breath and the way you breathe reduces anxiety."
4823,"taiyaki98","comment","","You just described my adult life. Yesterday I had the same conversation with my mother. She doesn't understand my trauma, my fear of people, being judged and of the adult life in general, she just said forget it, get over it.

Today is my first day and I am scared but I have to go or else she will be mad...I am not even seeing a therapist because she won't allow it, in her opinion I am fine I just need practice, but I feel my problem is deeper and practice won't solve it.

4836,"Boring_Raspberry5593","comment","","In my country you either have to go through the general healthcare to talk to a psychiatrist, or you can contact your nearest psychiatry directly but they are swamped so you generally don't get to come unless you're suicidal or in need of urgent care for either your own or others safety. Also you could go to a private clinic but it's generally very expensive so I haven't had the finances to do this since I don't work anymore. The woman I talked to was a psychiatrist provided to me through general healthcare. I've been thinking of trying an app where you can video chat with psychologists though, might feel easier than having to sit eye to eye with someone?nnI haven't really thought about it being panic attacks, I guess it could be panic attacks? But I'm really not sure, like I said it's like a wave washes over me with anxiety, I start to sweat, shake, it sort of feels like I'm not there and that what's happening is not real, my heart is pounding and I want to escape the situation. I guess I don't want to say that I've had a panic attack and maybe offend people who suffer from it if it's not actually that... But I do know that I get an intense wave of anxiety"
4839,"chatty52","comment","","I can somewhat relate to what you’re saying. I’m 23 now and developed SA at around 16, I get nauseous before doing anything social and analyse every conversation I’ve had afterwards, cringing at everything I’ve said. nnWhat has helped me is firstly weekly therapy, which I’ve been having for over a year now. It makes you understand why you feel the way you do and actions you can take to change your short term feelings. Also confiding in family and any close friends you have is a good idea, so at least they understand your reasons for being distant. nnFinally, the biggest thing that’s helped me is exposure therapy. I force myself to go to social events, sometimes even dates if I’m feeling brave. To tell the truth a lot of the time I feel very uncomfortable and it cuts me up on the inside, but after repeating the process over and over again it gets slightly better. I still have SA and think I always will, but you have to break through that initial barrier in order for it to get a bit easier. nnIn terms of how my social anxiety developed, was definitely substance abuse from a young age. I never used to be anxious, but a few panic attacks and a couple of addictions later I had severe anxiety. I’m now completely clean (bar cigarettes) and am somewhat happier, but I think SA will always be there. nnI’m not sure why you have developed it, everyone’s different, but getting therapy is a good step towards finding out as you can explore your past traumas and experiences. nnHang in there, it will get easier you just have to start making baby steps towards your goals, as change is never possible without action."

Congrats! nnI'm 25 and I started about a year ago, I've been to therapy before but could never bring myself to say that I needed help with social anxiety until last year (I've struggled with this since I was a kid). It was the best decision I ever made, it also helps that I have an great therapist. I don't have much advice, other than to try and stick with it cause it takes alot of time but I've seen huge improvements. This was the hardest therapy for me because it required alot of homework and practice, but if you stick with it and ACTUALLY do the homework/practice, it really pays off.nnGoodluck!! You've got this!"
4891,"sarcastic_mermaid","comment","","25 here, and I can relate to a lot of what you’re saying. Anxiety dictated my every move during my teens and early 20’s, leading me to many missed opportunities and poor decisions. I would absolutely redo that era of my life if it were possible. I think it’s okay to mourn what your life could have been. nnWith that being said, I think that depression and anxiety love to make us think that we’ve completely failed, when we haven’t. Try to take a step back, and breathe. Remember that feelings are not necessarily facts. You might feel as though you wasted your early 20’s, but there’s probably a lot that you accomplished during those years that you’re not giving yourself credit for. I also think there’s an expectation that you have to be successful/have everything figured out by 25, when that’s not true for most people. nnYou have time, OP. It may be worth giving therapy another try, maybe with a different therapist. While therapy unfortunately doesn’t make these thoughts and feelings magically disappear, it can be helpful just to talk it through with someone."

I really dislike bullying, and I feel sorry you are going through all that.nnI prefer to be that ""weird loner"", because I have that same feeling of resentment and I want to be different than most. Yet society pressures me into fear and anxiety, doing things I feel uncomfortable doing. They think ""Therapy and medication fixes you"", ""College is a ticket to success"", so on, so forth. I don't think so. Your feeling of worth and purpose is what keeps you alive.. I can feel what you feel in many ways (I hope you get what I mean).

4935,"Witchy_Crybaby","comment","","I know everyone is different so I don't want to be giving medical advice really, but you might want to consider asking your psychotherapist for a psychiatrist recommendation. Maybe a combination of the two will help you more than just a psychiatrist or maybe once you start seeing a psychiatrist you'll realize you don't want to continue with your psychotherapist. Unfortunately it's kind of a trial and error when it comes to that kinda thing. nnI'm currently on Prozac 20mg, Lamictal 50mg, buspirone 5mg twice a day and hydroxyzine 25mg that I can take up to three times a day as needed. Really they all help for stabilizing my mood and my depression, my anxiety not so much, the hydroxyzine makes me tired so when I see her at the end of the month I'm gonna be telling her that being exhausted all the time hasn't stopped me from being anxious. nnFor me personally, yes, medication is more helpful than talking through things. I've just struggled with it for so long and tried everything I possibly could and looked up how to calm myself down and in the moment, they never helped. It's like when I become anxious, all my logic is thrown out."
4937,"Witchy_Crybaby","comment","","Well I've been struggling with anxiety since I can remember, I was always described by teachers and my parents as shy.

When they never did work, I realized that no matter what I did, how much I breathed and talked myself down, that my anxiety and stuff were things I couldn't control.nnWhen I first started seeing my psychiatrist like I laid everything out on the table and before my first appointment I had written down all the main things that I needed help with. I have bipolar disorder and major depression and anxiety, so the first thing she did was get me on mood stabilizers and an antidepressant. Once we found a combo I did well on, then the process began of getting my anxiety under control, a process I'm still going through. nnI suppose the difference is like my psychiatrist can see that I understand my thoughts are irrational and I tell her that, like that I know in public hearing someone laugh doesn't mean they're laughing at me but it feels like they are, I know leaving the house is a necessity and there's no reason to panic, yet I still have that feeling of impending doom. So really the only things we really talk about are how my medications are helping, I explain how my symptoms and thoughts have changed and we tweak them."

My anxiety on the other hand has not unfortunately, but I do have an appointment coming up to discuss that. As now really even though my depression has gotten better, the fact I'm still so anxious makes me feel awful because with the depression fog relatively lifted, I care more and want to do things like go to the dentist and the store and get a job, but I'm still terrified."
4950,"Holy_Kek_Balls","comment","","I (Dutch, 23M) am currently doing CBT and it is helping me a lot. I am aI have had 13 sessions from March until now and my approach to social situation has changed a lot. Before I started my recovery I was depressed, very insecure and planned out all my social situation before they happened. Now I am much more confident and almost don't care about social situations anymore. Sometimes i have bad days, but those are part of life. I have learned where my anxiety comes from and because of this I can calm myself down very easily. So I am longer afraid of panicking and being afraid of the anxiety itself does not help...nnFor everyone reading this I really recommend searching professional help, since it helped me so much. You are welcome to dm me with questions or your struggles. I hope I can help!"
4953,"vanvell","comment","","I’m 23 (f) and have been in therapy since grade 9, so almost 10 years now. It honestly completely changed my life.nTherapy takes a lot of commitment and hard work, and at first it may seem like things are just getting worse and not better. Stick with it though, it gets worse because you’re finally talking about all these horrible anxieties you have that you’ve been pushing down for years so naturally it’s gonna be hard when they finally come up. It also may take awhile to work, but don’t be mad at yourself about that. It’s one step forward, two steps back as with most new habits you try to form. But honestly, do it! Do it do it do it! I can’t express it enough over how amazing therapy is! nI did CBT for about 5 years, that really laid the foundation for me and I feel like it completely changed the wiring of my brain. It was a lot of cognitive exercises and teaching you techniques for how to combat the anxiety. At first it can seem really annoying to do these things, I definitely felt that way at first, but now looking back I realized that all I use all those techniques everyday and that they’ve made my life 1000 times more bearable. I now do DBT, which is often used for those with borderline personality disorder but is helpful to anyone who feels emotions very intensely. It basically teaches you how to deal with the extreme waves of emotion/anxiety that will overwhelm you and stop you from being able to function. I recommend CBT for someone who is just starting out though. Remember, it’s important to find a therapist you click with. It can take a few tries with different people, but don’t stop if it takes awhile. If you don’t click with someone that’s okay. Once you find someone you like, it will still be hard work, but having someone you click with and who genuinely cares about you makes all the difference."
4954,"vanvell","comment","","Why wouldn’t they give you the time of day though? Do you ignore people who are ugly? I don’t think you do! You seem like a kind person who just needs to reprioritize your thoughts. I know it’s hard, I struggle from low self esteem myself and some days I’m convinced that I’m the ugliest person to ever live. But therapy and CBT has helped me immensely, making it a lot easier to let go of superficial desires and focus more on just being happy and confident in my body. I’m sending you lots of positive vibes and love, and hope you can get to a place where the mean voice in your head is even just a little quieter. Remember, that voice is lying! It’s an outright liar  lol, it’s not trying to help you, it’s not being honest with you, it’s lying."

4975,"BUGA55","comment","","If you want therapy you’ll have to commit to in person, it’ll be more effective that way. A lot can be lost in translation from having a conversation in text form. I went once and having a person to listen to your woes releases all that anxiety. That is if you can manage to muster up the drive to do it :) nnFYI, I bailed, because I felt the receptionist and waiting area was unfriendly for a clinic. I got to go back to improve the quality of my life nnHope you feel better"

Just ask me some questions if you're more interested! :)nnAnd bro I also suffered from social anxiety only but the issues social anxiety brings with it soon will give you depression. That's what it did with me so please get your social anxiety in order and maybe do a therapy or just bring yourself a lot in social events and unconfident situations (out of comfort zone). That's what I would have told myself when I only suffered from social anxiety. Just a hint with love!"

4991,"AllNerfNoBuff","comment","","Yup I'm 25 no job, no car, living with my parents, and I don't even have a learners because the thought of failing it and being judge by my parents kills me inside. My accounting degree means jack when I have 0 internship experience. All my friends have moved on from video games so I can't talk to them regularly anymore.

4997,"LotsaEggSandwiches","comment","","Maybe I'll give you some insight from someone who fits this label. I have social anxiety but I'm also an extrovert. I need social interaction to function and I like people. But, I can't order in restaurants without shaking, I can't give presentations without nearly crying, when I moved to university I had a breakdown before I did any activities where I'd have to meet new people. I dread going to the grocery store, when I'm jogging on the forest trails near my house and I hear people coming my way I turn around because it scares me to have to interact with them. I can't fill out forms without overthinking: it's taken me two months to apply to a grocery store job because the thought of being new at a job and interacting with a group of people who already know each other makes me want to vomit out of stress. Among many other examples, I think it's safe to say that I face anxiety-based adversities and I do so almost every day. nnThat being said, I also want to have friends and do activities. Sometimes I feel strong and I compliment a stranger on their outfit, I'll be anxious the whole time but I still do it. I make myself meet people and initiate conversations, I try my best to be as strong as possible so I can live the life I really want. My extroverted side comes out, I seem very bubbly and excited even though I'm having heart palpitations and my stomach is in knots. A lot of people are surprised that I have social anxiety because I seem like I'm really able to put myself out there. nnIt's like you're gatekeeping social anxiety, there are more to people than what meets the eye, and you seem to not understand how people can struggle when they aren't meeting your ""criteria"" for anxiety. nnPeople can be shy and not shake, cry, choke, sweat, etc. They are valid in their struggles even if they aren't as extreme. Having anxiety and some shyness is human, and it doesn't need to heavily impact their lives to be real. Just because you get these extreme symptoms doesn't mean you can discredit other people. I'm sorry that you think others can never fully understand, but you really have no way of knowing what others are going through. I think it's also really weird that people HATE others for experiencing these feelings. So what, they're wrong about being shy? People interpret their own feelings differently so what's shy to them might not be to you. nnSorry if this seemed like a rant, I just think this can be a really damaging and narrow-minded way of thinking. I agree to an extent that when people exaggerate things or self diagnose, it's irritating and can be demeaning for the rest of us. I think rather than come out with ""I lowkey hate..."" it would be better to try and educate others and start a discourse. At the end of the day who are we to discredit others based on their personal interpretations of their own feelings."
5000,"idkjustanxious","comment","","I wish it would be taken more seriously, most people still don't believe SA is a REAL thing, they take it as some excuse to be lazy, mostly because they don't understand or even try to understand it. I was diagnosed and I know I will have to cope with it for the rest of my life, nothing can ""cure"" it, so when thinking about getting a job I always feel so guilty, I'm 22 already and I never had a real job, when looking for a career I just looked for one that didn't require lots of social activities and I'm still studying scared for the moment I have to put myself out there. It's like my life has to be molded around my anxiety so It would be SO AMAZING if we could put in our resume SA and have people understand us instead of looking down on us."

But when it comes to just doing stuff just cos I want to, eg, going to a cafe, shopping for something other than food, going out out, etc, I can't do it.nnI am much better nowadays than I used to be. I noticed a big change in myself when I got a job delivering. I was with a driver for 10 hours a day, visiting 40 houses a day and it forces you to learn to talk to people. Seeing lots of people a day puts into perspective how most social interactions don't matter. It was a physical job too and when you carry a washing machine to a top floor flat, you're too knackered to give a shit about what you said. Also I found a bit of pride in being able to carry heavy stuff as an unfit-ish guy, makes you feel useful ya know?nnThere's no secret to overcoming anxiety, you just gotta take small steps and it's hard, no lie. But if you want to live your life how you want, you gotta work for it. No one can do it for you. Others can help like therapists, and they do help a lot of people, but you still gotta work for it. Take every bit of help available.nnOne ""technique"" i do is pretend other people aren't real when i get really anxious. They do not matter because they do not exist. Think of them as NPCs ya know?nnIdk hope this helps, it's a struggle but i wish you luck for your future"

5023,"Redechinacea","comment","","Hi, i'm a 25 years old woman. At 23 I began therapy for social anxiety and by now I have improved a lot and are actually able to enjoy socializing with other people than my closest friends. I still tend to look for signs that everybody secretly hates me all the time if i'm not consciously shutting those thoughts out though. But have improved a lot and I also didnt make as much as 1 friend at the University - that was the absolute worst years of my life so far and i'm glad they made me realize i needed help. So it is possible to improve. Also I started strenght training a year ago and that has helped me a lot. I hired a personal trainer, and it was expensive but definitely worth it, even when it was half of my income. And don't worry about sexual experience, it is different for everyone, so learning to fuck one person will not necesarily help you get better at fucking somebody else. But you could consider checking out ""omg yes"" if you want educational content on womens pleasure. nnAlso i have acne, and my experience is that working on my appeareance is worth it when it comes to improving my social anxiety - getting medication, loosing 5 kilos and being conscious about my way of dressing. So i'll definitely recommend you to work on your body, personal style, hairdressing and skincare if relevant. nnSorry my explicitness and bad Spelling, i'm danish."
5038,"back2thelotus","comment","","Oh yes. I used to have that and it was actually the reason why I went to therapy in the first place. The way to get past it for me was acceptance. When the tight feeling in my throat would arise, I wouldn't try to fight it. I'd work on letting it be, and I'd tell myself I wouldn't mind it. I also didn't change a single thing about my routine either when this came on. I wouldn't sip water, or do anything to try and 'help' it, because this ironically makes it worse in the long run. It was hard to adopt this approach at first, but it really does work. By doing this I haven't gagged due to anxiety in well over a year. Meditation, mindfulness and acceptance is the key to relief of this symptom and social anxiety itself."

I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for about 7 years now. It started when I was in elementary school. The first few years I was normal, didn't worry about anything and everything seemed to go well. Then kids started calling me names and bullying me because of my clothes and my big nose. Then it hit me hard, they were right. I was just and ugly fuck pretending to be cool.nnFast forward to middle school where I became even more anxious and socially awkward because it was a really crowded school and everyone expected all kinds of things from me while I couldn't even function properly. I'd spend my days sitting at my desk, staring at my books, pretending to pay attention because I was too scared to even lift my head up to look at the text on the board. When the lesson was over I'd walk to an abandoned spot in the study wing as fast as I could and sit there in silence looking at my phone till the next class started. nnWhen I got home I'd be too tired and worn out to study or exercise so I'd disappear into video games. nnFast forward a couple more years. I'm a complete wreck, I have crippling anxiety all day when I have to go to school or work. I've never had any female friends because I'm too awkward and ugly. I couldn't suppress my struggle anymore so I told my mother and I've been in therapy and on meds for a few months now. nnI'm 17 and I don't know anymore. Every day I feel numbing anxiety from the moment I wake up till I get home. I have to constantly force myself to do stuff, to get out of bed, to go to school, to go out while all I wanna do is die. nI work hard for school, I exercise, I try to be social, I meditate, I read, I draw, I have a job but it doesn't matter what I do or how hard I try, I'm still the same mess as I was before. nnEvery time it seems to get better and I finally feel happy and without worries and have nice contacts with people I wake up the next day and I'm back where I was, how am I supposed to keep relationships with people when I am like this. Right now I'm laying in bed, I have work in like an hour and I'm freaking out inside telling myself ""Don't go, don't go, don't go.""nnI'm sorry if I sound like a complaining little bitch, I just needed to ramble and let it out somewhere."

In 4th grade stuff began to change, I had a horrible teacher who would blatently bully me for my weight and a speech impediment I had since birth. Everyone picked up on it and my class picked on me daily. Now I know everyone gets bullied once in their life time and this sounds quite dramatic but it really did happen, and it shaped my self esteem to what it is today. I kept my head up and after multiple complaints the teacher was fired. The bullying and picking never stopped though. I literally missed the day where people made friends, I still had people I regularly talked with but by 6th grade everyone was getting clique-ish and my group was shrinking dramatically. Once middle school came I was excited to get to meet new people but I got mixed with the wrong crowd, and a very abusive ""friend"". It took both years but I eventually dumped them in time for high school. I'm a senior now, but the past 4 years every day I wake up, go to school, go to every class, go home, do some homework, brows the net a bit, eat then sleep. Every. Single. Day. It's as if 4th grade was foreshadowing for how lifeless I'd be. I've asked other people for advice and they all say the same thing ""Have you tried making friends at all?"", and the answer every time is of course yes. I live in a tiny small town in Indiana, surrounded with corn and a clearing for a football feild and a few houses. There's not a lot of people who haven't always known me as the outcast looser girl, and with 12 years in the community it's a hard title to stripe myself of. This is my struggle though; do I want a life? Do I even want friends? Of course my answer is yes but when I think about actually going up to talk to someone and introducing myself and trying to get to know them, I just don't see it at all. I keep pushing it off to college, telling myself that I'll make friends next year. But thinking about trying to make friends with my reputation and be seen as a lame loser with no one and getting rejected makes me want to throw up. I so badly want friends, but do I really?"
5098,"JussStop","post","Anxiety and Me","Rambles of a Restless Mind:nnI am now 24 years old and still tell myself my ""condition"" will get better as I get older. I can specifically remember being 18, on my way to exiting my teenage years and telling myself that my 20s will be different. So far, Ive been wrong. The same feelings remain. The gripping of my physical body by invisible forces continues, leaving me in a space much like that of the Sunken Place in ""Get Out"" as my mind continues to race on negatively to oblivion. The worst part about living this way is remembering the brief moments when the pain lifts and the sun shines brightly on ones soul, releasing you for an instant from the burden of your anxieties. When being social seems to flow so simply and you just go with the flow of life and everything is finally RIGHT... Then poof... The good times are gone and the self-loathing and agoraphobia come rushing back. You cherish those moments because you dont know when, or if, youll get a chance to experience those joyous feelings again. Its all in your head, they say. I know this. Thats the shittiest part about this affliction. I spend my days trying to understand what moments in my life sent me down this road, or if it stems from genetics but cannot pinpoint where ""I went wrong."" I have a brother who goes through life like a breeze. The same brother who tormented me growing up. I often think my issue is rooted in how much my brother and myself got along over the years which has been very, very little. The only thing we share, the only thing my brother felt we could come together on was music. If not for making music, I feel we would have never re-entered each others lives. I feel cheated because from my perspective, its been my brother that propelled the low self-esteem and self hatred in me. To only be accepted by my brother because of my ""talent"" only made me feel worse. The thing which I used to empty my thoughts on why I felt the way I felt was now being incringed upon and controlled by who could possibly be THEE REASON I feel the way I feel today. I know its stupid and unhealthy to blame another for how you feel but I will. I will because it was not me who would hurl insults at myself that were way more than making fun.. it was not me who would torment myself in front of others. I couldnt cause that kind of distress in myself. The kind of distress that you fall into unhealthy ways of coping over. The kind of distress you run away from, using instant gratification as a source for happy feelings. I couldnt traumatize myself enough to get stuck in a pattern of behaviours that only served to make the issue worsen over time. No. I couldnt do that. Knowing this, it gets hard when I read about natural selection and bullshit about strong and weak because in reality, we've all got the potential to become one or the other based on the environment we grow up in and the thoughts about ourselves which are positively or negatively reinforced. If you look at our American society today from the outside, youll see how much we praise the worst kinds of people. The kinds of people who torment others for their own pleasure, then turn around and ask ""whats wrong,"" after attacking the peace of mind of another. One can only take so much. Eventually you hit a wall, a point of no return of sorts, and accept the negatives about you. What you tell yourself begins to sound like what your attackers tell you about yourself and the journey on the road of social anxiety and little joy begins. nnIm caught between wanting to feel better and not caring about ever feeling better altogether. I know that, to the brain, thoughts are like exercise; the more you think about something the stronger the connections in your brain, pertaining to those thoughts, become. I am now 24, once again, and have had ample time to strengthen the worst parts of my brain due to negatively reinforced thoughts growing up. If you feel like I do, Im sorry you had to be subjected to prolonged treatments of negativity, causing you to form a pattern of negative thinking that youve been forced into. I know how hard it is to wake up every day wishing you did not, while those that exposed you to the negativity smile and laugh and have no problem ""being themselves."" nnThough we all feel alone, we are not. nIf no one ever reads this, oh well. nI really just needed to relay some thoughts.nThe sad part is this is the only place I felt I could do that.nI hope one day I can look back on this post from a heightened sense about myself. That would be a moment to behold. nTill then, I wish you all the best on your own journeys.nn- some guy on the internet"

I started going to therapy about 2 years ago I think and started taking medication about 1.5 years ago. Before help, I had severe social anxiety. Just the typical. Having trouble going out in public, going to school, talking to people, attracting any sort of attention to myself, crying after school because of the fucking littlest things. But after getting help, I sky rocketed. But the problem is that even though I may be more comfortable with talking to people, I don't know how to carry a conversation? Like all I do is nod, smile and say ""yeah"". Like my brain has never been used to having conversations because my social anxiety has never given me the chance to do so. But now that I am somewhat comfortable with talking, I don't know how.. I know that this can be a good topic to talk about with my therapist, but how can she help? I feel like this is something that you can't just.. fix? Have you ever had help with anything similar?"

I have no motivation to do anything about it though, I am struggling to get out of the house and interact with people, I also have social anxiety. Just so you understand me better.nnI am extremely depressed at this point, it is so difficult because I took on a college course and I have hardly gone in, when I do go in nobody takes me serious cause I never turn up. I emailed the tutors weeks ago telling them I have been dealing with depression but am okay now, at that point I thought I would be once I just got a hold of myself...I ended up slipping back into a depressed state a few days later. I have now missed more classes and am humiliated at this point to contact them again and turn up, I feel like a joke. It is a school they are running not a hospital. The social aspect is crippling for me, I am finding it difficult to be around strangers in a store let alone making friends in college. I just want to hide away and not face people cause of what a failure I feel I am. nnI already told the student advisor at the beginning of the year to give me a chance to go to college this year again when I missed the last semester due to leaving an emotional abusive relationship after 6 years and told him I was doing better, I feel so guilty he really helped me to get into this year and I feel I have fucked it, and I have nobody to blame but myself. nnI did try to go to a student counselor for a few weeks, he told me all I seem to do is kill time, I talk about nothing relevant. I go to the gym at late hours and that is the reason I am being harassed. That I need to start going at normal hours and coming to college. He seemed to think this depression and social anxiety I have is all just a joke. I am beginning to think maybe I am just a joke and everyone should laugh at me. I have been on the same antidepressant celexa for 8 years now. I take 15 mg, I weaned myself down to 10 from 20 but after telling her my social issues, dr told me to go to 15.

If I ask anybody what they think about me, there usually is a lot of positive things to be said. I get told that I'm very physically attractive, that I'm smart, talented, funny, interesting, cool, etc. But when I try to bond with people and make friends and connections, I get the impression that I'm a giant unlikable freak of nature. n n I'm constantly trying and having to resist sabotaging my relationships with people because I feel like I'm just so annoying and weird to them, no matter how much they reaffirm that they feel the opposite way. They could kiss my ass until their lips wear down and I'd still feel like I'm just a last resort in place of literally anybody else. Anybody is better than me, I feel like a shitty person to be friends with, thus I'm never happy being in company. Mind you I'm not happy being alone either, but I feel worse when I'm with others. n n Common feedback that I get is that I'll never feel loved if I don't love myself and I think that's simple and fair. So I assessed what it is that I don't like about myself. n n Thing is, I think I'm pretty and I like the way I look. I think I have good taste in music, I play a few instruments and I'm not too bad at playing. I'm trying to make beats and produce music and I'm not too shabby at that either. I'm a visual artist and I have done and am trying to do more art commissions and I'm proud of that. I think I'm quite awesome. I just don't see what anybody else could like about me. I don't see who else would give two shits about that stuff, if that makes sense? I feel that it's not enough. n n I think this mindset is rooted in some trauma I experienced in high school where my friend who I considered my sister and the one person I trusted and opened up to completely betrayed me out of nowhere. One summer she decided she wanted to be more popular and get into partying and drinking, which was fine. nn However she was constantly comparing me to her new friends that she found, making me out to be some hermit loser for not doing the things they were and inviting me out with them only to humiliate me and put me down in front of them. Naturally, it upset me. I thought she was somebody who truly accepted me for all who I was and then all of a sudden she was throwing personal things about me in my face. Maybe she hated herself and saw the person she thought she was in me, whatever the fuck but we had a falling out. nn She's long since apologized but we haven't been able to be friends like we were before since then. I tried but it just wasn't working. We exchange messages once a year, on my birthday, usually her telling me happy birthday. I still feel like she thinks I'm a hermit loser even though she expresses missing me, thinking about me and whatnot. I should also add that after this altercation that a lot of other people who were close to me treated me badly the rest of the year and I got into fights and embarrassing situations and stuff, I don't know. nn I just don't believe people who say nice shit and I always get the impression no matter how hard I try to maintain friendships that I'm just not good enough for them. Sorry that this is so fucking long but what can I do? It's to the point where I've told people I need to be alone for the rest of the month because I can't deal with them acknowledging my existence. They've all respected that I need some space and are waiting for me to return but I'll probably feel the same once I get back in touch with them. I don't know what my problem is really.

I had friends when I was younger, but once high school started we all drifted apart and my life went to shit. I'm in college now (UK college, so I'm only 17). I was treated like absolute shit in high school. For the first 6 months, nobody acknowledged me. Eventually they did, but in a negative way. Horrific bullying occurred that left me selfharming and a failed suicide attempt that nobody else knows about. I automatically vomited up the pills and was ""fine"", physically anyway. I struggled through the rest of high school, hoping that starting college would help my social life. A fresh canvas, so to speak. Getting to make a new first impression on people who don't know me as the weird depressed girl who always sits at the back of class and gets herself detention on purpose to avoid walking around alone during lunch break and getting harassed. It sounded great. I was fucking wrong. nnA week into college, I knew somehow, somewhere, I'd fucked up. Social groups were starting to form, people had had a week to find their ""crowd"", so to speak. Naturally, nobody had spoken to me except to ask me for a pen. I'd attempted to speak to the people sitting on my table (which took all my effort, I had wanted to die inside) but it would never fledge into a proper conversation. They would answer me, but then I wouldn't know what to say and would just kind of smile and nod along awkwardly.nnI'm now 6 months in. Nothing has changed. Everybody has friends. Everyone is going out clubbing and shit on Saturday night and I haven't fucking been invited anywhere. I hate it. I fucking hate it. I love stuff like that. I'm not a recluse. I don't want to be anyway. Fuck. I'd love to go into the city for a night with my friends and have fun, flirt with guys, get drunk etc. It's what people my age are supposed to do. And what's extra frustrating is that I'm a really fun person once you actually become my friend. The few friends I've had always said that, before we all drifted apart I was the most popular friend in our little group at the beginning of high school. There were about 11 of us. Where did it go wrong?nnToday, I overheard this girl talking about me. She's talking to the guy in her table and I'm like 2 metres away but for some reason they think I can't hear. What I heard was something like ""BMTHJessi is scary. She glares at you like you're a living piece of crap and then will attempt to compliment you on your drawing 5 seconds later as if she wants to be nice. She's so fake, everyone thinks it. I hate people like that, thought they'd be out of my life now I've left high school."" nnThe girl who said this isn't a typical bitch, she actually seems like a really sweet girl a lot of the time. According to her Facebook she's gone through bullying during high school etc. She's been through a lot. I can actually relate to her in a lot of ways even though we've never really properly talked. This just makes me feel even more hurt that she thinks of me as the very kind of person who drove me to attempting suicide.nnI came to a realisation today and it hurts. It isn't other people, it's me. I'm not fake, if I don't like someone, I don't talk to them, and that's usually only if they've burned me first. I don't act fake towards people, I would never. Maybe it comes across that way but I don't mean to. I don't remember glaring at anyone at any point. If I have it has been subconsciously. I'm doing something wrong but I don't know how to change it. I'm not going to walk into college tomorrow all smiling, everybody already thinks I'm a fake so that will make it worse. Fuck. Is it too late to change things? Should I forget the social side and just focus on my education? Is my social life beyond saving?"

I was always bullied and an outcast,  especially due to my looks. Last time I was in college before I dropped out, it was pretty terrible, I had someone from my highschool in the same class that did not like me, called me ugly and her friends didn't like me either. most people seemed to not like me either. It was such a miserable experience, I ended up dropping out because my depression got so bad and how unliked I felt by people. I couldn't concentrate on my work anymore, couldn't bear to do anymore presentations or group work.nnIts been six years, I'm 23 now and I lived a lot of those years in complete fear and putting life on hold. Now I want to go back out there and do something with my life. I'm trying to apply for jobs and I rarely hear anything and it hard to find a job suited to social anxiety. so I think I should just go back to college for that extra job security and income and that my mom is pressuring me. She is worried sick about me and I cant handle her worry and stress over me, so I will try to go back to college to ease her and a benefit for my future. I'm just scared college will make me mentally worse again.nnnBut I feel so terrified. I'm not a great looking person and I'm terrified of being called ugly again and treated badly by others especially being around people my age. I feel my heart race and want to run, if anyone looks at me for even a second. Should I try to give it another shot or keep looking hard for a job?  I'm currently on Zoloft, but I don't feel much different so far.nnnI just feel so lost, I have no idea what to study, what I like, my depression and anxiety stole most of my passion, I  have no idea what step I should take in my life"

We had a bonding session 2 weeks ago and i did not take the opportunity to make new friends there...nnI dont even know how to. I have nothing to say. A few of my classmates have asked why Im so quiet. I just say ""i dont know, i have nothing to say lol"" and it always, ALWAYS, follows with an awkward silence. Then they leave or go to talk to some other friends.nnThere were 2 people who even asked me if i was ok because ive been reaaalllyyy quiet the whole camp. There are some classmates whom ive known for 2 years but not really friends, but i know some stuff about them. I want to befriend them but it feels like im not their type of friend. I dont like swearing so i dont talk in their ""language"". E.g. person A teases person B and person B says ""/F*** you!"" And they both laugh. If I was person B it would be so much different. I would laugh nervously and try to think of a comeback which means awkward silence, and i usually have nothing to say. I try my best to think of something but it never works out well. Whenever I successfully engage in a conversation, I usually cant speak up loud enough (i try) or I cant understand what theyre saying. Usually takes time for me to process what someone says if it isnt very distinguishable. I dont know what to do.nnThanks for reading."

I dont know where it came from however, my family was always kind to me and my parents are still married, there weren't any problems which i can remember back in my childhood.nnThe extraordinary thing about me is, that i always was the alpha male in class and generally in groups where i feel comfortable (kind of a dominant personality) ,however, I do struggle sometimes when it comes to meeting new people and big social gatherings where I cant drink alcohol.nnMy biggest fear is still meeting girls, especially doing something with them alone when i dont know them yet. When im drunk, i am able to approach every girl and dont care about rejection. Also, im then able to flirt with them and im quite succesful with it (getting to make-out every weekend.) Next day when im sober again, im getting all my SA back and cant meet up with them, because the anxiety hinders me (i think im really awkward sometimes)nnI've tried therapy before, it didnt help me much ,however my therapist showed me a helpful method called hypnosis (search for it on youtube, for example hypnosis for confidence.) I do it every day and i think it helped me a lot to atleast build confidence (do a hypnosis session before going to a social gathering, it makes you more relaxed.)nnFor everyone who has problems in conversations, try getting the mindest 'i like these people and i want to talk to them and have fun'  into your head,it helps a lot for me. As soon as you have a meaningful, interesting or fun conversation with someone or a group, you'll gain feel good chemicals  and from then on you can go on with the flow (this however doesnt help with severe SA i can imagine.) Also, try to stay in the moment and really try to comprehend what the others are saying ( meditate every day to get the ability to stay present.)nnMy biggest problem is still my sexual anxiety, my first time was a really bad experience. I didnt know the girl well enough and was nervous as hell (couldnt get it up.) This really bothers me because i think i could get many girls and im always telling myself that i need to have fun in my youth.nnI would be really happy if you can share a few tips for my problem, thanks for reading.nn"

5240,"towers9","post","I just realized how I developed social anxiety. I'm scared to seek help","This is going to be long.nSo, I'm an 18 year old guy. I finished High School last year and I'm about to start university. I have been struggling with social anxiety for a couple of years (even though I wasn't aware I had it) and after a lot of thinking I realized how I developed it... Let's start from the beginning. When I was very very young I used to be a very shy kid (the kind of kid that would hide behind his mother when meeting new people) but as I grew older I became a bit more extroverted. During the first years of primary school I was one of the most ""popular"" (I wasn't a bully or anything like that, I just was a friendly kid with lots of friends) and smartest kids in school; I remember that I used to be very happy at that time. nBut then, when I hit puberty (when I was around 11 years old) I became a bit of an awkward kid (I believe I was considerably more awkward than most kids of my age at that time). Even though I was very sporty, smart and I had quite a few good friends, people started to make fun of me by saying I was a ""nerd"" and things like that since I was the skinniest and most awkward kid.nThe last year of primary school was probably the year when the social anxiety began. Two new kids who where complete assholes joined the school that year... and I guess they wanted to show their dominance in order to fit in the group by bullying other kids that they considered weak. I was the ideal victim for them: a skinny, awkward, ""nerdy"" kid that was already being made fun of ocassionally. These two kids started to make fun of me too, but they took it to a new level. They never attacked me physically, but they insulted me and humilliated me in front of other people at the school every time they could. These two bullies eventually became really popular (the bad kind of popular) and I became very introverted and awkward as a result of the bullying. I never told my parents about that because I didn't think it was important at that time.nThen they kept bullying me during High School. I've had low self steem since then. I had a small group of friends even though most people either made fun of me or tried to avoid me. I wasn't invited to parties or other events very often. I was too scared to talk to girls I liked so I never had a girlfriend during my school years (and I've never had one to this day). I became socially anxious without realizing it.nI finished High School last year. The good thing is that I got the highest grades in my group and that I got admitted to one of the best Universities in my country (I'm very proud of that :) ). The bad thing is that I have Social Anxiety. I lost contact with most of the people I called ""friends"" during school, and now it is very hard for me to make new friends. I get really anxious whenever I'm the center of attention (I 've had panic attacks in these kind of situations). I feel lonely, depressed and unable to make friends. I going to start the University in two months and I really want to get over my SA, be able to make friends, have a girlfriend, speak in public, be sociable and just be happy. nI feel like my social development has been stunted. Most people my age have close friends, they know how to socialize, the are charismatic and the have been in multiple relationships. Meanwhile, I feel unable to connect with other people and make friends. People my age make me specially anxious, probably because I was bullied by them. I just want to be normal.nI live with both my parents and I get along well with them. They have no idea about my SA and I'm terrified to tell them. They think that I'm completely normal and that I have close friends.nI know I need help. I think going to a therapist would be beneficial but I'm completely terrified of telling my parents because I don't want them to think that they have a mentally ill son (even though the kind of do). nThank you very much if you read this, I really needed to get this thoughts out of my head. I will be grateful to read your suggestions about this problem. nBy the way, sorry about my grammar... English isn't my first language.n"
5241,"BrazilianRabbit","post","First post, need some help *MISDIAGNOSED?*","Hi, I am a 17 year old boy and I have Panic Disorder. When I was 13 years old I got my first panic attack at the barbershop. I always liked the barbershop because they touched my hair and gave me a sort of a massage. Since than I avoided that barbershop not because of the people that worked there but, I thought that if I went again to that place I would lose control and go crazy ( didnt know what a panic attack was). After this experience I felt somewhat weird but it didn't really bother my, I was pretty confident. A couple years later I was at the supermarket waiting in line and felt this super strange feeling again, mumbled some words to the cashier and thought wtf lol? Then I started to avoid this supermarket also, couldn't go alone to that supermarket but with a parent of friends everything was fine. By the time I was very social, introverted, but it wasn't a problem for me. I had a girl friend and felt pretty fine, did lots of presentations because I liked it, was always talking in class making jokes, but still in some situations I thought about the weird feeling I got at the supermarket and barbershop (extreme urge to run away, of being trapped, going crazy) and that made me sometimes nervous of doing things involving other people ( never tought about it as being judged in doing me but, just scared to get this feeling or being at places that were hard to escape because I couldn't control it). 1 year ago, I lost my girlfriend, parents got into extreme fights and now im in the middle of a divorce. Not the best situation but everything was ok coz summer and spending lots of time with friends and doing fun stuff, smoking weed every weekend. But 1 day I woke up with a super strange feeling, everything felt super fake and made me depressed as ****, slept everyday for 12 hours. Summer was over and school started. I became super nervous for no reason, sitting in a class room made me sweating like crazy. Could cope with it but stopped smoking weed, alcohol and ciggarettes. When I had to read things out loud it was still okay, could do it but for some reason I was scared I would get this weird feeling and go crazy, everthing felt already super fake and I thought I had a crazy disease or deficieny. Avoided going to a lot of places, exercising made me feel super weird because I was scared for my heart pumping ( mimicked the panic feeling). Then I had to read something out loud, panicked but no one remarked it, was more an extreme urge to run away. Things went downhill after this, started panicking more and more and had panic attacks in class ( not fullblown but a feeling of dying and going crazy scared to jump out of the window lasted for approx 2 mins but the super weird feeling whole day). Self-esteem was pretty low but still had fun with my friends and picking up girls. 1 day I had sex and I became super anxious about not being able to do the thing and get a panic attack because of the heart pumping and she would seee that I was anxious, lost al balance in bed, room was spinning ( not really because of her I had known her for a long time and had sex multiple times before) The next day we did it again and everything was ok. But 3 days after this experience I had more trouble talking to girls, scared of panic attacks when I did and making a fool of myself, outside my house it didnn't feel safe constant derealization. I went to the GP and she said I had an anxiety disorder ( Thought lol **** this isnt true) but yeah couple weeks later I started with CBT. Things got clearer but the anxiety worse, couldn't talk to strangers any more ( sometimes I could because I didn't feel anxious or sweaty and thing went pretty smooth than felt like my old self) , speaking in class was worst nightmare along with presentations. I had to do my presentation  and thought F it did it but, extreme shaky was so happy when I was done but everyone thought wtf. nI am diagnosed as Panic Disorder. My question is, is this right? When you have social anxiety you have a fear of being judged negatively, right? But I dont know if I have this fear, I dont like these situations because I might get a panic attack but not really if someone judges me. If someone say they dont like my or hate me I'm okay with that but, sometimes this gives me a weird feeling of not being able to talk back and get a panic attack midsentence and othertimes I can laugh it off. I tested myself by doing extremely embarrising stuff (cycling through the town in my underwear, even saw people I know, they laughed) but I didn't feel panicky. And the other time in class and someone asks me if I want to give a presentation I might get a crazy panicattack. Sorry 4 bad english "

Currently I’m not in therapy or taking medication. nThe past few years have been rough but I finally have a decent group of people that I kind of like. The problem is sometimes I feel like I hate people or maybe it’s talking to people or hanging out in groups because it makes me feel anxious. I worry about what I’m saying or doing or if my friends really like me. So then when I actually hangout especially in a group I dread going and then everyone always asks if I’m okay or if I’m having a good time. I just don’t want to be a burden on anyone and make everyone have less fun or feel uncomfortable because of me. nnnAt the same time when I’m not invited I feel neglected and left out. I have a best friend who’s my main friend but he has other groups of friends so when he’s hanging with them I’m home alone. But for some reason I get worried that he doesn’t like me because he has so much fun with them. Since I’ve never really had friends I become very emotionally attached to the ones I do have. For example my best friend and a newly made friend/romantic interest of mine are becoming close friends. For me I feel scared because my best friend is like the complete opposite of me he’s very charismatic and even when he thinks he’s being weird or awkward, people around him love that about him he just is good at being himself. For me being myself was never acceptable so I’d always try to impress others to like me but now I don’t even know who I am. So I have issues with trusting or being close because I worry they’ll just walk away and get tired of me. I also have low self-esteem and confidence in myself, which doesn’t help. nnSo unfortunately, I worry that their conversations are more interesting than mine and that they like him better. It’s hard living in his shadow because whenever other people want to hangout, I feel like they just invite me because I’m friends with him and not because of me. It’s gotten to the point that I’ve become pretty envious which I hate because he’s my friend. Honestly I don’t know what to do anymore I feel conflicted. I really hate that this is happening to me any solutions? "

Everything was so sunny and bright, I didn't dread going to school for once. When I came into school, the teachers were treating me nice, and my voice wasn't as quiet . My day was going great , and I even managed to talk to 2 girls for like an hour. I wished i could just go home and be satisfied with my day without any negative thoughts. I got on the bus to go home, and my fucking luck just ran out. My bully who treats me like shit was on that bus. I hoped he wouldnt notice me and used my phone for a while. Then my bully called me and said ""Who you texting""?. I responded by saying ""my friend"" and he laughed like it was the funniest thing in the world. He said ""you're the type of person to only be texting your mom"". I responded with nothing and just looked down on my phone. Everyone on the fucking bus heard what he said and it became silent. I wanted to cry, and also punch him in the fucking face for ruining my daynNow here I am, depressed as usual. This might've been the day I recovered from social anxiety but my bully messed it up :("

Although it has not been diagnosed but after a lot of online research, I came to this conclusion.n nI also feel depressed and sometimes it lasts for months. My depression comes and go. This has been going on for at least 7 years now.nnMy anxiety hasn't had any severe impact on my physical being. I have been generally a good perfomer in terms of grades. I also have a good paying jobnnBut socially, it is as miserable as it can get. I have zero social skills and I have a very hard time connecting with peoples. I have had friends in college, but I lost in touch with them. Everyone got busy with their own thing and also I started avoiding them. Although, I made some friends at my work place, but there was no real connection. Instead of calling them friends, i should call them acquaintance.nnI am also not very close with my family and I have no one to share these feelings with. Even the trivial things such as shopping and going out are very hard for me. Whenever I am surrounded by people, I have a constant feeling of being judged. I know this is all irrational and most of it is in my head.nnSo after working for 2.5 years, I thought it's time to make some changes. I made a brave decision of moving to a new city and taking a new job.nnI was excited, hoping that I would meet new people, make some friends. Hopefully find someone special.

5257,"aestheticcompulsive","post","Getting help- EMDR Therapy &amp; medication DNA testing","There are a lot of bleak posts on this sub, so I guess here's this...nnWhere I'm at with my anxiety right now: I can force myself into public, like going to the grocery store or the theater and be ok for the most part because I don't really have to directly socialize with anyone. I am currently a college  student, but I'm that quiet, weird kid who almost never talks. I have a pretty severe case of RBF, so I think people just think I'm a bitch. Since quitting my job a year and a half ago, I have been too afraid apply for another job, so I am unemployed. I have 1 friend and have never been in a relationship. nnEarlier this month I finally made myself go to therapy. It was undoubtedly uncomfortable and I did in fact ugly cry while rehashing my history of bullying and other miscellaneous traumatic experiences that contributed to my larger than life, monstrous social anxiety issue. After two sessions of talk therapy/CBT, Therapist One referred me to a secondary therapist whom Therapist One thought would be more of service to me. nnOn Thursday, I had my first appointment with the new, better equipped Therapist Two. She was empathetic, incredibly understanding and patient. I did some more ugly crying after once again, reciting my trauma history. Then we worked on a prognosis/plan. Next session, a week from yesterday, I am set to begin EMDR therapy. Upon the mention of medication, I expressed my apprehension (bad past experience with Zoloft/Sertraline, felt like an apathetic zombie and cannot recall anything beyond that during a 3-5 month span), to which she responded by informing me of a fairly recent DNA-based test, that can indicate which medications will work, which ones have potential and which ones have a slim to none chance of contributing anything fruitful. This was news to me. While I am still not crazy about the notion of being medicated, I figured at this point, why not? nnAs of now, I am feeling very hopeful about taking necessary steps to improve my life overall, but especially in the regard of my social life which has been an enormous hindrance since the inception of my SA 9-10 years ago. (I'm only 20, so roughly a hefty 50% portion of my existence has been anxiety riddled.) nnTldr nhttps://genesight.com/product/ nThe product website explains it more thoroughly for those interested! (I am by no means sponsored or anything like that. I just thought some people may find it interesting and/or helpful.)nn(Moral of the story:)nLastly, get help even if it is hard and initially sucks. Deep down, I think many of you know that you should get help, but muddle a good decision with excuses and later talk yourself out of it (this was me everyday for the last 5 years). The fact of the matter is that you cannot and will not improve if you do not take steps conducive to change. Imagine if you had gotten over this hurdle a year ago, five years ago-where/what would you be now? Future you will be eternally grateful you did. "

I always feel like I'm different, like I'm trying to fit in to this society with all these social norms that is common sense and that you should be able to do almost automatically. Like how I should use body language, how much eyecontact is needed, how to handle a conversation without making it awkward as hell. It's like I'm playing a role for a movie and I'm trying not to break character, all the time. Like I'm only acting my whole life. I always feel very anxious during and before I know that I'll have to be around/talk to people. nnI think all the time that people I speak to judge me, and every little mistake I make can haunt me in my thoughts the rest of the week, or even months/years depending on the situation. When I know I'll be speaking to someone, I always before try to play many possible conversations in my head that might happen to be prepared. Just doing ordinary things freaks me out. Traveling with my family to a different city/country just makes me want to stay in the hotel room more often because of my anxiety around people. nnAll this have gotten worse as I've been growing older, with feeling more anxious all the time with effects like sweating, high pulse, trembling, blushing, stuttering, dizziness and so on. I want to seek help, but still not. It feels like I'm making this all up to myself, because in my head there's no logic of why I'm feeling this way in these situations. But when it happens it's real. nnGetting help means I have to tell my parents about how I really feel, get to speak to a therapist/doctor(?) about my problems, and then possibly get some medication/therapy sessions to try to help me get less socially anxious, which might help me slightly with my negative view of myself and life. It's just to get there is the hard part as someone who doesn't fully thinks he deserves to be happy. nnI don't know what I expected to get out of this post, I just think I needed to share this to someone as I've been keeping all this to myself."

It has had extreme affects on my life, like dropping our of school to homeschool for 5th-8th grade went back to highschool for 9th-10th, and went back to homeschool because of panic attacks nearly everyday. I've always wanted to try and get over it without medication but it just isnt working, I haven't replied to any of my close friends for nearly a year and a half now and have an inbox full of invites and I miss yous that I just cant bring myself to reply too. nnSo I basically started self medicating about 3 years back, got severely addicted to cigarettes, and smoked weed every day, neither of those helped really at all so I cut them both out about a year ago. The only thing that did help was using psychedelics about once a month and talking with close friends while on them which did amazing things for my anxiety. However the ones I used were technically legal to purchase and you wouldn't get a prison sentence for having them but the law in my state changed last year so I haven't been able to use them for about 6 months now and my anxiety has gotten to an unbearable point. nn A few nights ago I was having a panic attack and I had a .5 mg klonopin left over from when I used to take psychedelics just in case I ever had a bad trip, which I never had to use it so I didnt know jow it effects you. I had never felt better in my life, I sent some messages to the people that I hadnt been replying too and didnt worry about mistyping something or saying something that might sound a little stupid for the next 4 hours. I decided then that if my anxiety is so bad that I haven't had a job for a year, losing the connections with all of my childhood friends and just worrying about everything can be fixed with a simple pill I need to seek medical help and nip it in the bud.nnNow this part might seem a little silly but it is a big worry about me taking medication. I really enjoy online competitive game, so my main goal is to get a medication that isnt going to completely fuck up my reaction time and make me a zombie( I also have to drive about 2-3 times a day so nothing too inhebriating).nnso the TL;DR is I need some suggestions on a medcation for social anxiety that isn't going to make me a zombie and fuck up reaction time.

(pics included)","https://imgur.com/a/wHVJnnnObviously these are shitty pics taken when I was sitting around the house after or before work but I wanted to give an honest idea of how I look.nnI just graduated from college a few years ago and I've never met a girl who seems interested in me and I'm almost certain it's because I'm genetically ugly. When I talk to girls I feel like I come off as a pathetic loser and the way I look is probably a big part of that, the idea of a woman finding me physically attractive is absurd to me. My forehead is giant and my jaw is sunk in so the lower half of my face looks really small and my head is disproportionately large compared to the rest of my body. Because of my sunken jaw I have tons of gross loose skin under my neck and around my chin, I had a hard time getting pics that show this that also look natural. I've been told my face has ""weird angles,"" if that makes any sense. I also have weird slanted teeth that make my smile look really bad. I was diagnosed with Asperger's when I was a kid and I think I have features that are typical of someone with a developmental disorder, like if someone saw me on the street they could tell I'm awkward and weird and have no chance with women just from how I look.nnBack in college when I'd try to talk to girls they'd either ignore me or seem really uncomfortable as soon as I start talking, sometimes they'd seem uncomfortable just being around me. I'd always develop these dumb crushes on cute normal girls and it would make me feel awful since there was nothing I could do about it and they'd probably think I'm gross if they knew how I felt. If I tried to show them I'm interested they'd probably either amused or insulted that I think I have a chance with them.nnI'm super self-conscious nowadays and whenever I'm around other people I feel like I stick out as being ""different."" I'm still looking for a decent job so I'm not looking to date at all but I'm worried I'll meet someone I like and I'll end up feeling shitty again. How do I deal with this?

I have my whole life ahead of me which scares the hell out of me. I suffer from an extreme case of social anxiety and depression, to the point where it has changed me into a heartless monster with no soul. A heart of stone, no empathy, no smiling, no crying. I’m just a shell. It has ate away at everything I once was as a happy little boy. Every time I walk outside I feel like I have 500 sniper rifles pointed at me. When I’m with people, they all seem like they have really figured out life, and genuinely enjoy living. And that scares the hell out of me.

I see these people I hangout with die laughing of a simple meme, and i struggle to even smile. There is just so much stress caught up in my head, and anger towards the world, towards people.

Every time I hear people talking I always assume it’s about me, bad things about me, and I can’t seem to convince myself I’m wrong. I am living in hell with so many mental problems. I’ve been keeping all of this bottled up inside for so many years. Everyday I visualize myself getting hit by a truck, or never waking up after overdosing. It’s so comforting and soothing.

5289,"Mexipino17","post","How I Cured My Social Anxiety + Found My True Self","I am a 19-year-old male. I did not always have social anxiety, but I believe I started out with very very moderate SA and it worsened over time until I cured it just recently around February or March, I don’t remember the exact date, but it was in 2018. I am so glad I finally cured my SA because it was really affecting my life negatively and it caused so much loneliness and depression. The loneliness and depression didn’t occur until my 6th or 7th grade year at my middle school, but it was at its all-time worst during my high school years. Before the day I cured it, I had difficulty expressing myself, communicating with ANYONE, going anywhere where I was in risk to having to speak with someone or seen by anyone, small things like cutting the grass, doing my jobs, going to the store, and even seeing my own family at get togethers I would not be able to speak to them.n	Some things that held me back from being myself because of the SA include: meeting new people, being terrified to interact with others-especially girls, skipping school because I had a presentation that day, not being able to my perform to my best abilities at any of my sports games, quitting my travel soccer team because one of my coaches made us do random things like dance or say something goofy in front of the team and I wasn’t cool with that at the time, instead of hanging out with friends I would rather just hide and play video games or watch anime, I couldn’t even talk to my first ever girlfriend in 7th grade (I have no idea why she liked me. Keep in mind she did not know my true self-only my SA self), and the list goes on. Social anxiety caused these things and made me a complete loner for a great portion of my life. At first, I thought it was just how I was and I was an extremely shy kid, but as I grew older I knew deep down inside that I was a very outgoing person and knowing this made my sadness even worse. At home, only my close family knew the true me. I was always dancing around the house, making everyone laugh, being a clown basically. It felt impossible for me to change during middle school/ high school because everyone knew me as that one “mute” kid and whenever my quietness was questioned, I felt awful because I knew everyone only knew the fake version of myself. It would have been very difficult to just outright change during these times because the anxiety was just too much.n	When I went off to college, I thought I would change easily, but the symptoms were still there. This was the lowest point of my life where I felt like an outsider and I just hid my depression from everyone. I never gave up on life though because I always believed and prayed to God that I would find that happy life that everyone else seemed to have while I was just sitting alone at that lunch table trying to figure out why I am so different from everyone else. After many nights of crying myself to sleep, I finally stopped running from my problems and started searching for answers. Instead of going to see a doctor like a normal person without SA would, I solved my own problem with the use of the internet. At the time, I thought I was just an extremely shy person, but I found out that I definitely had social anxiety with a simple google search. I actually found out that tons of people have my same issue and that gave me tons of confidence to finally change myself. Now I just needed to find out how to cure my anxiety. The biggest recommendation by people online was to get out of your comfort zone. My comfort zone was at my computer all day with no human interaction so I couldn’t even imagine doing that. So, what I did was take very small baby steps( my change was very gradual). I was brave enough to put myself in situations where I was forced to speak to people. I had a little bit of experience at my paper route job, but I needed more work.n	Big changes occurred during the time I started working as a security guard. I was always forced to speak to people and this gave me so much more confidence. It was a lot of standing around too so the only thing too pass the time was speaking with my coworkers. I will call one of the coworkers John. John was a great influence on my life because he taught me it is okay to be yourself, how to have fun during work, communicate with people, and enjoy life in general. He did not teach me directly all these things, I learned by his example when observing him. This job also gave me many realizations on life because at the same time I was committing an awful sin-stealing money. At first, deep down I did feel very guilty, but as I kept doing it it became easier and I stole much more each time, but of course the karma got to me and I was nearly caught. I believe I did receive a sign from God because one night after finished working, while the boss of my job was counting the money he told me I was 20 bucks short. I kept my cool knowing that I did in fact steal money that day and he told me it was no big deal and let me go. As I was leaving his office he ends up finding the 20 dollars hiding between a white paper where the money is held and lets me know. I took this as a blatant sign from God and decided to never commit a sin ever in my life again. S/o to “Pulp Fiction” and my idol Jules Winnfield. My favorite movie and character off all time. After this day I realized money is not the most important thing in this life and I believe the most important thing is happiness and “Pulp Fiction” does an amazing job of portraying this message. I also believe that anyone can change themselves for the better and stay on the righteous path of life. I know the character Jules has committed much worse crimes than me, but I feel like I completely relate to him because he also receives a sign from God while in the act of sinning . Jules is the man I respect, look up to, and definitely influenced me to become the “shepherd” in my life- s/o Quentin as well he’s the homie.n	Another thing that helped me cure my social anxiety was getting into social media. On Snapchat, I was lucky enough to make my username a very popular anime character’s name. Having this username had many people randomly add me because it is such a popular anime and character. One of those people is a very important girl- I’ll call her Jane. Jane is important to me because she helped me develop better social skills, gave me someone to speak to while I was very lonely, gave me more confidence in myself, helped me realize that it is not scary at all to speak to girls, and we were able to bond through similar interests. Sadly, I had to block her because she was becoming way too attached to me and claimed she loved me even though we never met. She is still young and needs to mature, but I definitely plan on meeting her in the future because she is very important to me. Hopefully she does not hold a grudge against me and understands why I blocked her.n	The next important person that helped change me was a girl I met through Tinder- I’ll call her Stephanie. I don’t know if meeting her was a crazy coincidence or another sign from God because we share many things in common. Before meeting her in person, when we were talking on Snap we had the same sense of humor, same randomness, she doesn’t know how to swim like me, a little color blind like me, and many more very specific things. I just had to meet her right away because I almost had the feeling she was my soul mate or something lol. I drove to her area and we hung out for the day. I did not make any moves on her besides a hi and bye hug because she gave off more of a little sister vibe. That day I also realized another thing about myself- I don’t like to see anyone sad and I want to show people how they could find happiness like me. I realized this when she told me about her past breakups and I also realized that she is not very confident in her appearance. This made me very sad to hear and I hope one day she will be happy or I could help her out in some way one day. She is a very good friend and I plan on hanging out with her many times in the future. Stephanie contributed to curing my social anxiety by helping me figure out myself more by finding out that I am interested in becoming a counselor, more confidence, better social skills, being with a girl alone for the first-time fear, and she also gave me more confidence to be myself.n	These events in my life led me to cure my social anxiety and another plus- finding and being my true self. As of right now I am actually really bummy lol because I withdrew from all my college classes knowing that I plan to change my major to a counselor related field in the fall and also there is no work for me right now, but that no excuse either because I should be applying to jobs I’m just being lazy lol- something else I need to fix pls help. I would say my social anxiety is completely cured, but I rarely have some general anxiety when in a place where English is not the common language (I plan on learning more languages), in sketchy type places or hoods, and when I see people that knew me as that one quiet kid. Lately I have been sad about not having a girlfriend, but that’s just because there is not much to do in my boring ass city, but I know that I just have to continue to be me and get out the house as much as I can. Cali looks like the fucking dream place frfr. Nowadays I am talkative with anyone, can hold a conversation, living life how I want to and enjoying it every day, and my favorite thing I like to do is make someones day and make them smile. My plans/goals/wishes for the future include: becoming a “shepherd”- just someone that people look up to and hopefully I can set them on the right path, maybe becoming a counselor, maybe become famous or something lmao, write a book of my life, writing a book on how to cure social anxiety that branches off into curing general anxiety maybe, make many connections with people, learn how to swim LOL, finding my true love someday, and just helping anyone that is going through some shit because I’ve been there and it’s the worse feeling, but I believe anyone can find what makes them happy if I can. nMy biggest inspirations are Jules Winnfield, Naruto Uzumaki, and myself.nJules - Stay on the righteous path.nNaruto - Follow your dreams/passions-always believe in yourself!nMe - And lastly, just be you.nPlease respect my opinions and religious views. Thank you! If you have any comments or questions feel free to ask and I will try to answer them all!n"

Could our fault for over-analysing simply be leading us to the truth?nnAt work, my boss just doesn't like me. He makes no effort to communicate with me other than criticise, while I see new people being hired every month and yet with them, he bothers to ask how their day or week was. I've never, ever gotten that in the entire year that I've been there, and it makes me feel like shit. Like I said, he criticises me and this is usually in front of others, and although with them/my other coworkers is where I get to assumptions, it feels like (in turn of my boss' attitude towards me) they all treat me the way he does; they talk to me like I'm a bumbling idiot/child who doesn't know how to do my job. And then not talk to me either. nnI ""over-analyse"" what I see and experience, and what I see and experience has made my job miserable. I'd like to think my boss likes me, but I just know-- I swear that I KNOW its not true.nnI'm not saying people with anxiety have some sort of super power, but that our analysing or attention to detail is a feeling/reaction like any normal person's. Because anxiety does make us act out in ways that may seem unusual for others, and in turn they react, and in turn WE react to that... but the way we react is interpreted as overthinking things? Again, I'd like to think its just knowing that this or that person doesn't like us, just like any regular person without anxiety would know if someone else wouldn't like them. nnApologies if I'm not making sense... I know what I'm saying but find it hard to get across."

I used to have kyphosis which i had surgery for, but before the surgery there was not a minute that went by without me feeling uncomfortable and anxious about my posture and my general apperance.nnIn social situations i generally get nauseous/butterflies, i sweat a lot whenever im in focus/talk, and i blush and turn red. I like to think im fun with close friends, but im so so awkward. I also dont really have a lot of friends outside the 3 i hang out most with. I recently went on a date and i was nauseous as i expected, but it got so bad that i puked right before and also couldnt eat anything the same day.nnIf theres anything happening thats planned, i worry a lot about it. It might be hanging out with friends, or travelling, or really anything social. Last summer i had to cancel going to a concert with my friends because i felt so anxious about it, and i lied and said it was another issue. Its always so easy to cancel instead of worrying, but i dont want to drift away from my friends. nnWhen im at parties or social gatherings, and if ive lost my friends, i get anxious and most of the time i just find the nearest toilet and sit there until they answer my messages. Being alone in a social setting scares me. I hate big family events because theres so many people talking and telling stories and i dont talk because of that and it makes me self conscious. I could never go shopping alone, or go to the cinema alone etc.nnIve always been the ""clown"" in my friend groups. Im usually the one that takes the most jokes, and im used to it. I like to think it doesnt affect me but i guess it does deep down.nnIve never had panic attacks i dont think, but i feel like my physical symptons are the worst. I think i might have mild social anxiety and a  lot of confidence issues. I can talk to strangers even if i dont like it, i find it harder to talk with friends about meaningful things. nnIve never told anyone about this before, and its the first time im writing this out. I dont think i will tell my family yet, they would support me but honestly the thought of them knowing makes me feel uncomfortable. I might go see a doctor first instead. Maybe get betablockers for the physical symptoms and atleast see a therapist.nnSorry for the long post, i just felt the need to write this out somewhere right now."

I don't know what it is or why I feel it. I thought it had gotten better after I've read multiple after multiple articles and books to try and relieve and work on the anxiety, but i guess it's worse than I thought and almost uncontrollable. I just can't stop thinking. I don't want to complain about my mental state because I feel like others have it worse, but now I'm not so sure. It seems other people are more well equipped to deal with life than me, l don't know what to do anymore. I'm thinking about finding a therapist but I don't know what they can do if I'm being honest. I really just want to see how I'm acting, change it and be normal. My heart won't stop racing, I just got off a busy shift at work and honestly I thought I was okay but some girl coworker I just met told me ""just breathe, I get that feeling too"" when she said that all my thoughts came rushing into my head because no one has ever really tried to help me, and then one of the other managers commented about the same thing. I realized that it actually is really bad and much worse than I thought. I feel like all my problems come from inside my head. Lack of friends, lack of any relationship, lack of connecting to family or ""friends"" that have always come and gone, pretty much any and every social weakness I have and I hate it. It's causing me problems outside of what it is, I'd say sadness and loneliness are the main ones I can think about. I don't think I'm suicidal yet but I've felt it a couple years before dreading every day, I don't think I've hit that point yet but it feels closer every day. Now I'm just rambling off nonsense, I just really need a solution, I want to be normal, have friends, be all there. I don't want to be like this anymore, I just feel constantly in my head and can't get out."

5311,"StarShot77","post","I need help navigating a situation","So there is this girl I have been friends with on Facebook for a while, whom I also knew in high school. We hung out with the same crowds but never really interacted. We share a lot of common interests and I think of her as my dream girl. nnWe haven't spoken much. Two years ago I randomly messaged her because she was mutual friends with this other girl I was trying to befriend who got the wrong idea and ditched me. She listened and was pretty understanding but I didn't drag it on too long. Since then we didn't speak until a few months a go when I messaged her out of the blue one night. She was cool about it and we had some fun in our dialogue. She said she was cool with being friends now since we weren't in high school. nnOur dialogue is pretty short most of the time, as casual conversation doesn't get far. When intoxicated, I've opened up to her and she has been pretty understanding and supportive of me. She's even encouraged me to talk to her more. That's not exactly what I want from our relationship, as I want the usual friendship that isn't riddled with my anxiety and depressive symptoms constantly coming up. nnA month ago, I felt bold enough to ask her if she wanted to go see the new Pacific Rim with me. She gave me a ""possibly"" answer and went into a lengthy explanation about how she really wanted to, but was very busy over the next six weeks (the stuff she was busy with was true). nnLast night we talked briefly and she mentioned that the responsibilities she had were ending soon and specified that she would have more free time. Today, I asked her if she wanted to go see Deadpool 2 when it comes out in two weeks, with a ""possibly"" as a response. She seems interested but since I am bad at reading into things I am here to get more input. nnShe is a very nice and caring person, and I believe her when she says she cares about me. When I decided to quit Facebook last week over an emotional fit she gave me her number without asking and told me to message her whenever, if I needed something, and made me promise to keep in touch. nnThough when I message or text her she isn't always responsive. To be fair though, my social anxiety makes me have unrealistic standards of that and I hypothesize rejection before anything actually happens. She is nice though and seems willing to listen to my problems, but in that respect it makes me feel like she wants to be my therapist instead of my friend. In my experience, anything short of a ""yes"" tends to mean ""no"", and she is the kind of person who is too nice and considerate to give a straight ""no"" answer. nnRegardless, she does seem to want to keep in contact and cares about me. So I am perplexed about which way the winds are blowing in this situation. It's also two weeks until it comes out, so it's fair to get a ""possibly"" when neither she nor I could commit to seeing it right now. Still, my social anxiety is running rampant again so I am here to get answers, albeit indirect ones. "
5320,"StarShot77","post","I need help coming to terms with a situation","About a year ago, I met a girl who lives in Europe through a sub-Reddit. We began talking for initial mutual purposes and then in general. Initially it seemed we didn't share a lot in common, but I like her for her mind. What I mean is, she has the same types of weird thoughts, fantasies, and other thoughts in her head that I do during the day. It's sort of like the Joker finding Harley Quinn (without murder or violence though). nnNeedless to say I have feelings for her. Last fall when our dialogue was just casual I became very depressed due to life circumstances and she put up with the blunt of it, something I feel terrible for making her endure. She was there for me, and for that along she means a lot to me. I'm a pretty neurotic person and she eventually became more of a therapist than a friend. I constantly turned to her when emotionally distressed about things, and she came to resent it. It got to the point where I almost ruined our relationship but we talked it out. I acted more confident as she wanted to see and things have been great ever since. nnI've gotten to know more about her, and she is a very interesting person. She reminds me so much of me in some ways. Alas, she bats for the other team and has made it clear she doesn't feel attracted to me that way. I'm really happy with where things are right now, but part of me is pained by how I will never have her, or even meet her. And I like that, I feel like I found that rare person who compliments you in such a way. nnWhen such a conflict arises I tend to do what I've done in the past, which is passively aggressively give hints that I'm discontent without saying it until I push the other person away. I like what we have, I just want my heart to stop aching for what I realistically will never have. How can I do this?"

I’m 22 now and doing a masters degree. Depression and social anxiety has meant I haven’t attended most of my seminars due to feeling uncomfortable around other people, meaning I’ve made no friends this year. It doesn’t help that I have very few university contact hours, so there’s no solid routine I can get into. I struggle to even leave the house, I feel in physical danger if I do. The problem is I feel very lonely. I want to be social and go out, but I feel strangled by my social anxiety. It’s so frustrating because when I do go to seminars, meetings, I see that they’re not as bad as I thought. I can cope. But as soon as I have a few days in the house, I sink back into the fear of the outside world. Thinking about any sort of social event, especially a university one, makes my chest tighten and I get shortness of breath. I’m going to have to get a full time job in September but how on earth am I going to do that if I can barely leave the house? I am having relatively regular hypnotherapy sessions to try and tackle my issues. My hypnotherapist thinks lots of my problems stem from an emotionally abusive step-parent who made me feel bad about myself when I was growing up.

As you can imagine, I have some severe problems which make me believe I'm missing so much of my own life and kinda like throw away all the good stuff. I haven't had good experiences with psychologists, and that's why I hope someone here can help me \- at least a little bit.nnI'm 18 years old and don't have much friends. Actually I wouldn't even call them ""friends"", because they are either my girlfriend or colleagues. In school I always was kind of popular for some reason, but I never got to that point, where you are a real friend to someone, like doing stuff together, talking about everything and so on. I don’t even know why. Well \- I know one thing \- it was always my fault. Maybe even on purpose. It's not that people didn't want to be my friend! As long as I can remember \(still to this day\) I have some serious trust issues with everyone. If someone’s nice to me, I immediately suspect anything bad and try to think of reasons why they are nice to me and what they want. So I guess that’s the main reason I don’t really have friends.nnLife went on and everything is going very great for me. When I think about it, I don’t have any single problem right now \(apart from this topic of course\). Over the years I learned how to fake confidence, because it’s very important for my job. But apart from my workplace I’m still the anxious little boy that trusts no\-one. nnNo\-one except for my girlfriend! I met her two months ago and there were some chemistry between us immediately. Luckily she did the whole stuff like asking me out first and when I’m with her I feel safe and secure, because I believe she likes me as I am. I don’t know why I think she couldn’t betray me so easily. Actually very naive of me when I think of it…nnYesterday she got an invitation to a barbecue and told me I could come, too. She got invited by some people she also didn’t even know very well and apparently they said her boyfriend is also invited. First I said I would love to come, but I guess she knows me too well and noticed I don't really feel comfortable about it. So we agreed that it was totally okay for her to go alone, which I was very glad of. The problem was that a\) they were many people and b\) not even my gf knew them well. At the end of the evening they decided to go partying and from this point my mind went totally crazy and my heart pounded like shit. I imagined her being with other guys, being in dangerous situations, but most importantly it bugged me that I haven't been with her. Not because I'm jealous or I don't trust her, more because I felt like a really shitty boyfriend. I mean, I'm happy enough to have a girlfriend in my condition, but I could scare her away so easily with my problems. nnThe thing is that is would never be possible for me to to a bar or a club, like almost everyone in my age does. Apart from the many people who are in these locations, I don't even get the point of buying overpriced alcohol and dancing in front of foreign people. Isn't that so embarrassing? I couldn't sleep the whole night, later her new\-found friends have brought her home \(which isn't actually my duty as a bf?\), and she always texted me, which was really cute from her, so at least now I don't have pictures of her being with other dudes in my mind anymore. But it really nerves me that I'm not capable of having fun and going out like a normal social human being! I want to spend time with her, maybe even with her friends \(btw, she wrote that I already might have fucked up with them, because apparently they expected me to come\) and also would like to experience the atmosphere of a club some time. But my anxiety just doesn't let me. In the moment I just fear losing her because of my problems, and I really don't want this to happen. She means so much to me. I wrote a long text to her, explaining how I feel and that I'm sorry I'm so special. I also asked why she's with me. She could easily find someone better, everyone's better than me as a boyfriend. Anyway \- Let's hope for a good response when she wakes up.nnI can imagine some of you are in a similar position and maybe even found a way to get over this. I would love to hear every single tip you have for me, because I really want to work on myself! nnSorry for this wall of text and eventual grammar mistakes, English is not my native language.

5346,"theJAZZ3204","post","Social anxiety sucks but it's not the end of the world.. Long","A little background here... I'm a 20 year old male with pretty severe anxiety and a very mild form of autism known as PDD. Having PDD means essentially that mentally you're always going to be a few years behind. Mentally I feel like I'm 14 or 15, but at least I'm mature enough now to recognize that. Maturity wise i've always been 4 or 5 years younger, so hopefully as I get older I'll eventually start acting my age.nnSo this disorder first really became a problem in middle school, after going through a traumatic event. I was popular in elementary school (everyone thought I was funny), but I became socially withdrawn. I was put on heavy doses of experimental medication though, which, while cured my social anxiety and depression, turned me into a psychotic, narcassistic, fat freak who had no emotion and didn't give a shit about anything but me. I eventually (over the course of years), got off of everything because the meds were killing me physically and psychologically. This is when my social anxiety returned with a vengeance, and became unbearable. In 10th grade I transferred to a small private school for troubled teens after moving out of an **autism** school I had been in for 2 years (the meds pretty much made me lose control over my behavior completely, public wasn't an option anymore). I was so scared of people that I couldn't make eye contact, could barely speak up at all. When I did, I always embarassed myself. I'm sure people thought I was slow or something.nnI ended up getting convinced that the only way to control my anxiety was through illegal drug use. Yes, my plan was to smoke weed and abuse Xanax among other things so I didn't embarass myself everywhere I went. And, yeah, I got involved in some pretty heavy drug use. It did cure my social anxiety, though, for the most part (Heavy Xanax and alcohol intake, that is). I ended up making some friends (most I'm still close with), keep a job and excel at it, and I even (sort of) lost my virginity.... But the excessive drug use was a nightmare. My doses kept going up and up, and every time I tried to taper I'd just become a psycho. They were hitting the danger zone; I was seriously afraid stopping them would kill me. I was up to an equivalent of 50mg Xanax daily, an absurd amount. Since withdrawals off this shit can be deadly and because I was a junkie I felt like stopping wasn't an option. I ended up being so depressed I woke up every day wishing I was dead. I became an obnoxious, cruel narcissist. Never accepted blame for anything. Bitched constantly. Manipulated people. I was just out of touch. And I was dopesick all the time too. Always in pain. When I had sex for the first time I could barely get it up even though I loved the girl (I still do), which was embarassing and painful. Things ended horribly with her, and I've got nobody but myself to blame for that. Even most of my friends couldn't stand to be near me and those who could were also really out of touch. Parents were saying literally every day that they were going to kick me out, and they were searching my room every day and finding shit. Even though I worked 40 hours a week, pretty much every penny I made went to drugs, alcohol and cigarettes. It was awful; I turned into a junkie and an asshole nobody wanted to be around. nnOne night, a week or so after me and my ex cut things off, I took an unusually high amount of benzos and drank about a bottle of vodka when I was out with friends. I barely remember coming home that night. Woke up in a cell. They said I assaulted my stepdad and attacked cops who showed up after. The guy was sick of my shit, rightfully so I see now, and wanted to bust me. Damn did I get busted. I ended up spending 77 days in what was essentially prison (a step up from the county jail, where real inmates go), had to detox cold-turkey. It was brutal and lasted a month, but I'm alive. I was convicted of 5 misdemeanors in jail and I now have to wear an alcohol monitoring bracelet (which I've worn since April). I have a felony (assault on officer) pending, but if I don't break the lengthy conditions of my probation for another 60 days, I'll only get 3 more misdeamors (huzahh).nnThings are fucking tough right now. My social anxiety is back with a vengeance, and, again, everyone thinks I'm autistic as fuck. Hell, I even started writing this in the first place because someone at work today said I was ""slow"", because the intense stress I have to deal with makes it very hard to focus on work and process info. Work is torture because the last thing I want to do right now is communicate with anyone and doing that all day makes me extremely, extremely uncomfortable. Interacting with strangers and coworkers aside, I even feel like I lost the ability to relate to anyone, including close friends. It fucking sucks.nnThings are getting better, slowly, however. I was put on 50mg Zoloft a month ago and I have to say I'm surprised at just how effective this is. I'm able to get out of bed, I don't dwell on things as much, talking to people isn't *totally* impossible, and I'm finally seeing the obvious error in my ways and trying to make amends with anyone I've hurt. My apologized to my mom, who understood, thank god, and told me something I won't forget: ""When you're so caught up in how awful *you* feel, it's understandable that it's hard to see things from another person's perspective."" I'm making amends with my stepdad, who I used to think was Satan incarnate. I see now he isn't such a bad guy as long as you're not breaking every law under the sun in his house. Even made up with my ex, who said she'd ""be there for me, forever and always"". I really don't deserve people this understanding. A friend of mine who used to not be able to stand me because of my bitching ended up hanging out with me a few times and had a lot of fun. I remember him saying, ""Are you cutting the bitching out just because I'm around?"" People really aren't so bad, I've found; I can't understand why I'm still so terrified of them. But things are getting better slowly. I actually think that, if I just keep working hard, saving up money, focusing on sobreity, et cetera, I have a bright future ahead of me. Because I'm not dumb and because people in much worse situations than me have made it out alive by giving it their all. Every time I'm at work, and I'm tired, and people are making fun of me, and I'm so uncomfortable I'm studdering, I just keep thinking about my ex, how she, for example, worked 60 hours a week just to stay alive on her own at 18 to escape from an abusive household. I could be in a much, much worse situation and I'm a wuss if I continue to just blame everything on my anxiety and other people, and never take the steps myself to improve my life. A quote from my absolute favorite show, a legit masterpiece and a work of art, *Neon Genesis Evangelion*, is something I live by day to day; ""As long as the sun, the moon, and the stars exist, you will always have a *chance* to be happy. After all, you are **alive**, make the most of it.""nnAnyone who actually read this, thank you so much. This is really my life story more than anything and if I'm being totally honest I wrote this as a form of therapy. I went overboard, but if my story reaches someone, somewhere and helps someone out in some way, shape or form, I'm glad. We're all in this together, we're never alone in our struggles.nntldr: It may seem like rock bottom now, and daily life may be a very real struggle. But there is *always* a *chance* at happiness as long as you are alive no matter how hopeless it all may seem.nntldr 2: zoloft induced rant tbh"

I did a 15min group discussion on a brand of my choice with six others on Saturday. We basically pretended to be market researchers and moderate to get the others talking about the brand for that time. When I moderated I was shaking with my legs so much my whole body was shaking too.. as I write this now I do it again. Also I felt my heart race. It’s doing this now again. My hands got sweaty and shaky, I wanted to run away. Another nice symptom showed up: dissociation. I felt as if I wasn’t there and couldn’t consciously comprehend anything of what the others said. Weirdly enough I still managed to ask questions, it happened like an automatic process. Like a robot version of myself took over. Almost had tears in my eyes and when it was over and I got in my car I actually cried for a good 10min. Then shortly felt better, drove home and cried again, still shaking like crazy for about an hour. I then distracted myself.nnThe funny thing is two people told me I looked so calm 😂 people always tell me this when I hold a presentation wtfnnSooo the problem is I’ll do a 20min presentation next Saturday. Fuck me what do I do to not be such a mess? And be in control of my emotions instead of them controlling my body? Any tricks? I can’t diagnose myself but this sounds so much like a panic attack to me. How do I calm down from one? When I think about this group discussion which was 36 hours ago I still want to run until I break down. Focusing on my breath doesn’t cut it really."

I really need a haircut (too long, damaged, impossible to deal with) and I keep putting it off even though people I know have actually brought up that I need one (so awkward!). I have read a few posts on here about haircuts, but it seems my anxiety differs a bit. I don’t have a problem with the small talk or explaining what I want. Instead I have a bit of anxiety about getting a bad haircut and HUGEnanxiety about people’s reactions after. Weird I know. I hate the attention and the whole “did you get a haircut?” thing. It seriously makes me want to cancel plans with people or always wear my hair up. I literally feel anxious about it for a month (until everyone I know has seen it).  I know this is a really stupid anxiety, but it is keeping me from making an appointment. I have the same problem if I change my makeup or wear a dramatic outfit, so I avoid both. I don’t know it’s an embarrassing problem that I don’t really understand. Ugh. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks guys "

5355,"swarmofhell","post","the unease eats away at my mind...","this is my first post on this website and im about to get into something that has impacted my social life immensely. i am 15 years old about to be a sophomore in high school and in the beginning of freshmen year i was still quite stressed and depressed all the time, but as time went on it got worse. around december 2017 i got kicked out of my high school and wasn’t in school for a total of 4 and a half months. when i was in my old high school everything was great, compared to how things are now. I still had and went through many flaws, but things are worse now. Back then i felt that i was social with everybody and my status with all of my friends was good. Between December and March i was starting to become less social and only talked to the friends in my friend group and nobody really else. From March to now which is June, things have gotten worse for me. I started to drift away from my friends and everytime im out somewhere or hanging out with my “friends” I get really uneasy because of social interactions and i hardly speak at all within the duration im with these people. When im with these “friends” of mine im basically bored 95% of the time im with them and when im there they hardly acknowledge me. When I talk to them outside of real life i don’t really have much to talk about and i don’t care too much to talk about what’s going on in their life. I started going to a different school about a month and a half ago after getting expelled from my old school and i feel like im better around the new people i have started to talk to. I still get very bored around them and awkward for some reason and mainly just stay out of everything. but hey, being around them is better than the people i associate myself with. the problem is that all the people i actually do like don’t live anywhere near me. the last few days of this week there has been a fair going on in my town and my friends from my old high school hardly hung out with me during the days I went and even if I did hangout with them id just wind up walking away out of boredom because i really don’t care about what they have going on. So I just leave and do something else. I have a really bad reputation in my town for a lot of things and a lot of people don’t like me and don’t want to be around me for whatever reason, probably because im a metal head and everybody in my town and old high school are very close minded to types of music such as heavy metal and other things along that nature. to sum it all up, i don’t like the situation im going through and i get really nervous around other people and whenever people say hi to me or try and talk to me i just get really nervous and even more quiet and it’s hard for me to spit out a sentence because i do not like social interaction anymore. Nobody really cares about my wellbeing anymore at all either, also if im in big groups of people nobody says a word to me and im just there doing absolutely nothing. If anybody has advice for me please help me out and reply, my situation really sucks and i need advice from somebody. by the way I’ve already been down the route of going to therapy and i still do go to therapy and even then i still don’t like talking to anybody there and that shit doesn’t help me anymore. so that option is already outta the picture. i can’t be the only person in a situation similar to this one.

5357,"GiftedAnubis","post","I just realized how socially anxious I am today.","I always had some level of social anxiety that I  always thought is mild. In most social situations  I would feel nervous  but I thought  it's normal nervousness (unless I'm  in a busy street then for some reason I'm  on fight or flight mode feeling like I'm gonna die any second). Anyways today I went to a dermatologist. She was a nice person. Was smiling talking nicely and seemed like a nice person.  Yet for some reason I was shaking without realizing.  Didn't  even notice till she told me  I seem nervous  which I said I'm  fine. And then after taking she told me I should relax it's fine. Then I realized my hands are shaking and my gut is ""swallowing itself"" if that makes sense and I'm  jittery. Then I realised. I'm   quite  literally shaking. I started feeling cold for no reason and my mouth began to ""shake"" because  of how nervous I got after realising that I was shaking and that now I look weird.  After the appointment  was over I put my hands on my chest and I realize my heart is  atleast at 90BPM. Never realized that my social anxiety was THAT bad till today. I thought  I just had casual  nervousness. Don't  know what to do about it now."

I'd been in and out of different therapists' offices and they all tried to treat depression. My mom has been extremely insistent that I have major depressive disorder.nnHowever, I started seeing a therapist in December and a psychiatrist in May, and both of them are convinced that I have social anxiety more than anything else. They pointed out that my ""depression"" was actually a byproduct of my social anxiety since it drove me to being so isolated that I was lacking a basic human need.nnFor the first time, I felt truly hopeful and at peace with my mental health. For years, even when I was doing well, I was worried that I was ignoring a serious problem such as depression or ADHD. I desperately did not want to have either of those things: I didn't want to see myself as a depressed person and I didn't want to be on ADHD medications (I was for 6 years of my life and they absolutely destroyed me). nnNot only that, my therapist said she would MUCH rather try to treat someone with anxiety (especially a more narrowly focused type of it like this) than depression. nnHas anyone else had this experience? Social anxiety is definitely shit and I think I'm speaking for all of us when I say I wish I didn't have to deal with it, but for me it masqueraded as other things that would be even more burdensome.

I am at my grandfather's farm and we live on a road where there aren't a lot of people, or shouldn't be. It is near a few small towns however. I have been doing well with my social anxiety, until right now. I know I shouldn't be bothered by one bad person, but now I don't know if I should trust people anymore. My grandpa has a few dogs, boxers and they might jump but they are quite gentle.nnI am outside looking around when I hear someone shouting, which scares me. There is this lady on a bike. She yells at me ""Get your dogs away!"" Keep in mind the dogs are not near her, and are just on the driveway, they only go over when she starts yelling. I try to get them away, but she keeps yelling at me which makes me shake because it is terrifying me. I say ""Well maybe people shouldn't bike on this road."" She than says ""I shouldn't ride my bike here!?"" I mean this isn't where she lives, so I don't get her logic, anyone who lives on that road knows there are lots of animals, not just on my grandpas farm but other peoples too. I see her ride off and I just run into the house crying and feel this feeling of terror that I can't even feel in a nightmare. nnI have been diagnosed with social anxiety because I couldn't go to school. Last year my mother almost hit someones car and the lady went off on her, which made me terrified of cars. I can't easily go to my own town anymore because of that. I don't feel safe where I have felt safe for years. I am scared of her, of other people.nnAlso a car stopped while I was trying to get the dogs off the road, and the man starts laughing at me. I'm scared, I don't want her to hurt my dogs or me or my grandpa. I phoned my aunt when I was about to have a panic attack, I felt one coming and she talked to me for a while. I am sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, but I am really scared. I don't feel like I can handle life, I am already a failure. I'm only 14 but I am really hurt, I am sorry for bothering anyone but I don't know what to do. I thought my anxiety was getting better but it feels like I am going through it all over again. nnI mean did the man laugh because I look fat, or I'm short, I'm stupid?

I'm getting married this year and we have been fighting a lot because she just doesn't understand my social anxiety. She's paying for the wedding and is a control freak so it's been hellish dealing with her. I have really bad phone anxiety. I always feel like she's going to judge me for how I spend my time or judge me for my life choices and it causes panic attacks and/or crying. My mom knows I have anxiety. She understands that it affects who I am and how I live. I've told her many times since I was diagnosed about my phone anxiety yet she insists I call her everyday. To add to this, my phone is broken and when I call anyone I have to repeat myself 3 or 4 times until they understand what I'm saying which causes stress and anxiety in itself. When I don't call her she sends me messages along the lines of ""Well I guess you're too busy to talk to me,"" or ""Well I guess you're not calling today. I'm going to bed goodnight"" or she will just text me 10 times in a row until I answer. When I point out that she's being inconsiderate when she says things like that, she gets defensive and says that it's just because it's over text. I can't have my phone at work so I can't text her back which she is aware of but no matter what, if I don't answer, she freaks out. She says rude things to me and implies that the reason I didn't call is because I don't like her or I'm mad at her or I'm too busy or I just do nothing all day. She always implies it's for something other than my anxiety. No matter how many times I explain to her she just doesn't seem to understand. She thinks I use my anxiety as an excuse not to call her, like I'm making it up. Does anyone have any advice on how to help someone understand anxiety? I'm so sick of all the fighting and stress my mom is causing me. Please help! "

I have always had a stuttering problem since I've been born.... I feel like whenever I'm really happy I don't stutter as much but recently I feel like shit. Everybody at my work seems to be really outgoing and we often take alot of breaks and I just feel weird because I never really have anything to say.. I feel like people think I'm weird and when they say something to me my mind goes blank and I can't think of really anything to say. I used to think I was really funny but I feel like I'm losing my vocab and words really don't even make sense to me. It's really hard for me to focus on even what someone is trying to say and I feel like I can't even comprehend and keep a conversation going. This really brings down my self-esteem. Lately I've been avoiding my friends and I just don't feel like I'm myself anymore. I feel like I can't even handle any responsibility and my mind is constantly racing if negative thoughts and I just don't seem happy anymore. When someone shows me a funny video I hardly even find it funny and I just fake laugh so I don't seem weird. I feel like I'm always worried and I'm constantly thinking of the same thoughts all day. I can't seem to enjoy myself anymore. I feel like a boring person to be around and I feel like my personality is completely gone. I honestly don't know what to do anymore or what to think. Everyday I get home from work I just sit down and watch the time go by and worry about work the next day. I've been feeling this way for about 3 weeks now. I feel like I don't have any emotions anymore or even know how to feel... I'm constantly worried about fucking up and when I'm assigned a task at work it's difficult for me to focus and be organized.

I don't have health insurance but I am going to see a doctor the 14th . I honestly can't even read pin point how I feel. I've been working with the same person everyday and alot of the time I just watch and whenever I get to run off and do my own thing I usually start to feel better about myself. I just feel really confused and lost... Whenever I talk to someone my response is usually ""really""? Or ""hell yeah"". I constantly tell myself I'm stupid and just beat myself up. I never really felt this way but I just feel lost in my thoughts ever since I've gotten this job. I've never really been great at conversations and it's hard to enjoy life if you can't even talk to people.. This has completely taken over my life and honestly I don't know how to feel anymore. Nothing is making me happy and I dread to go to work. Don't get me wrong everybody at work is really awesome and it's laid back but I just feel mentally slow and antisocial and I feel like people are bored around me... I don't really know how much of this over thinking I can take.. As I look through all the posts I feel like I do have social anxiety.. I've always been a weed smoker but recently I've quit to see if I can get my memory back but I feel like weed was the only thing I looked forward to and made me happy and I've take that away from myself. I haven't had a good time in along time. I'm not sure if I have a disorder or all of this over thinking has just went out of control. Honestly I'm scared to even see a doctor because I feel like I can't explain myself that good. I feel like I've just lost all hope and my whole perception on life has changed. I guess you could probably say I have depression but honestly I really don't have much to be depressed about other then trying to make conversation .. I feel blank minded and I feel like I have no energy. I always feel slow. Can someone give me some advice..? Anything helps :/"

( 22 and still clueless)","*English isn't my first language so sorry if i make countless mistakes*nnI'm 22 and i've been very socially anxious and depressed since I was a teenager. I was a good student in secondary school and in CEGEP ( I don't really know why it exists but it's like a pre-university college) but once it was time to make  a career choice , going to university  , i just had no idea what to choose so i just left school after completing my CEGEP (which is a useless diploma since it just allows you to apply to university). That was last june. I briefly went to university but left because i reached a new high in terms of anxiety and depression.nnSince  , i've tried to have a job and maintain it but i always quit after a month (2 times) because my anxiety is just so bad. I have therapy and on medication which helps a little in social situations , which means i don't feel so hot and nauseous. I also began a career counseling process earlier this year. It was concluded that the job that would be most suitable for me would be that of a translator, but I failed the entrance examination at 2 different universities. So I guessed that I was just not good enough  for it. nnSeeing that there were only a few days left before the deadline for admission, I chose to register in linguistics because I thought that it was related to the translation job.nnSo as of now , i'm wondering if I should go back to university even though I don't feel motivated by school (it has always been so draining socially and mentally for me) anymore. I don't know how to express it but it almost like ptsd everytime I enter a scholar institution , I just never liked going there, but I don't know where else to go...nnI would like to know if any of you followed a different path than universitynn nnnn"

Hell, I can barely even hold a conversation without constantly thinking about rejection. Due to this thought I almost never socialize with girls out of fear and I don't know how to get past this. I've always been this way, even way back in elementary school I was afraid of talking to girls. nnI've been really depressed lately because I don't see myself changing and I hate living this lonely life. Something about me just seems to drive girls away too. If I'm ever forced into some sort of conversation with girl, there is always this awkward tension that seems like we both want to get away from each other. I don't know how other guys make it look so easy talking to groups of girls at a time. All I want is to find someone who understands me and I can be comfortable around.nnI'm currently going to therapy for my anxiety and I've brought this up to me therapist a few times.

5398,"Creepy_Presentation","post","I'm suffering with debilitating social anxiety. I feel like I'm going to spend the rest of my life living in fear.","Hello,nnThis is going to be a little long, but please take the time to read this. I don’t know what to do. I’m not trying to gain sympathy or pity, I just need to pour my heart out.nnI’m 20. I’m a boy. I have social anxiety. It’s something I struggled with my whole life. In school I was always quiet because I was very shy. Students used to always ask me “Why are you so quiet?” Teachers would call my parents and tell them “Your son is very quiet.” My parents would get mad at me because of it. When we would visit family, I was always quiet and in my shell. They would ask me, “Why are you so quiet? You can open up.” I was always shy and uncomfortable around family I didn’t see very often. My father always scolded me after we visited his family for being so quiet and acting uncomfortable around them. I spent a lot of time in the house. My father never liked that. He always wanted me to go outside and play with the other kids in the neighborhood, but I never wanted to out of fear. He would always give me a hard time for always being alone and not having friends. He would say, “You’re always alone, you have no friends.” I know I don’t have any friends and I’m always alone. It was very hurtful to listen to him and hear that, but he’s right. The truth hurts. He still says it to this day. I would talk to people in school, but I would never hang out with them outside of school. I couldn’t take that next step. And people never wanted to hang out with me anyway. They would never ask me if I wanted to hang out with them. They never asked for my phone number. I could never open up to people. I was always awkward and uncomfortable with other students in school. They definitely picked up on that. I went to the same school district since third grade, and I don’t have a single friend from there.nnMy anxiety hit rock bottom out of nowhere during my freshman year of high school. It could be attributed to the fact I was going through puberty and my hormones were raging or it just progressively got worse. I started developing so many issues that were not a problem prior. I started having a hard time making eye contact with people. Being sensitive to how people look at me. If I get dirty looks from someone or a weird look, I feel like something is wrong with me and I’m devastated. When I’m out for a walk and someone is approaching me I either put my face down and look at the ground to avoid eye contact or I try to make the effort to make eye contact with the passerby, but they just look at me funny and I feel awkward. Going out for car rides and feeling like people in other cars are looking at me and judging me. Going out for walks with other people around. People noticing that I’m nervous or uncomfortable and judging me for it. Walking into a room full of people with all eyes on me. Always feeling like people are staring at me and judging me.  Just so many issues that became so severe. nnI always had anxiety, but during my freshman year of high school my anxiety got much worse. Prior to this, my anxiety wasn’t that bad. I was more care-free. It was easier for me to interact with people. I was able to enjoy life more. The issues I started developing weren’t much of an issue in the past. I became so upset that my anxiety gotten worse. I let my mind convince myself that I’m never going to get better. I’m doomed to have social anxiety for the rest of my life. I’m never going to be able to go back to how I was before my freshman year of high school. Going out period around other people became too anxiety inducing for me, so I became a shut-in.nnI went through the rest of high school with debilitating anxiety. During sophomore year, I started eating lunch in the counseling office because eating in the cafeteria with all the other students became too overwhelming for me. I always walked with a book in my hand for a comfort. I was and still am very self-conscious of the way I walk. People say I walk very stiff or like a robot. Going to school everyday made me extremely nervous. Sitting in the classroom amongst other students and feeling like everyone is staring at me. Walking the hallways. Giving presentations. High school was hell. However I made it through and I graduated.nnI started college and I didn’t have the college experience. I struggled with anxiety. I just stayed in my dorm all day and did nothing. I didn’t make any friends, join any clubs/organizations, party, etc. I was too afraid to open up. I was too afraid to step outside of my comfort zone and make friends and just have fun. People would try to be my friend, but I was never comfortable. Everyone around me was having the time of their lives, making friends, etc. It was depressing because I wasn’t having any of that. I don’t even want to go back to school next year. nnI have no life. I just sit in the house all day everyday. I don’t work because I’m too afraid to get a job. How am I going to get through the interview? What if my coworkers won’t like me? What if my manager won’t like me? What if customers or my coworkers think I’m weird because I’m socially awkward? I try to get out of the house, but being out just makes me nervous.nnI want to have friends and I want to have a life. I feel like I have so much to offer, I just need to get past this awful fear. I go on social media and look at people I went to school with. They are having the time of their lives while I sit on my behind and do nothing. It’s upsetting. I have no personality. I feel like a robot. Everytime I interact with people in public I’m very stiff and robotic. People tell me I’m extremely nice, but honestly I feel like I have no personality. I can’t open up to people. I’m never comfortable and I’m always on edge.nnI’m living in fear. I just feel like I’m doomed to have social anxiety for the rest of my life. It has gotten so severe to the point where I don’t think I can ever recover.nnSorry for the long post, but I needed to pour my feelings out. I’m sick of people telling me I’m just a lazy bum. People don’t know that I’m suffering with debilitating anxiety that’s affecting my life.nnAny advice will be appreciated."
5399,"ConstantlyScared","post","I can't take it anymore... just some rant","HellonnI'm a 20 year old female and English isn't my native language so I apologize if something is difficult to understand. I suffer from severe social anxiety, mostly caused by years of bullying, mistreatment and isolation. Before that I always had been a shy and awkward kid. I have never finished school because my anxiety issues got worse and worse until in 11th grade just leaving the house was unbearable for me.nnBecause of that I spent my last 3 years almost exclusively in the house (I live with my parents). In places without people (like the streets here during the night) I can feel somewhat okay even though still anxious but as soon as there are people on the street it becomes impossible to manage for me. I can't even stand passing people or having someone look at me. Interacting with others isn't possible. I get so anxious and uncomfortable simply by being in public. I start shaking, my heart beats like crazy, I feel sick or dizzy, breathing feels difficult, sometimes my vision gets blurry. It's horrible.nnEven inside the house I feel anxiety. I know it sounds stupid but I can't stand in front of a window or pass a window during the day because I'm so scared that someone will see me.nnIt also feels like I just can't talk to people. It used to be like that all my life even before my anxiety got so bad. Nowadays I never talk to anyone except my family but even around them I can't do it. My mind is always blank and I can't come up with anything. When I say something my voice sounds shaky and unclear and I never say more than a few words. I also can't make eye contact with people. So awkward.nnAnother source of anxiety are my parents. I feel uneasy and nervous around them. According to my dad I'm a disgrace to the family which probably isn't even a lie but it still hurt to hear that from your own parent. They think anxiety issues don't exist. Almost every day I get yelled at or put down because I stay in my room the whole day and never do anything useful. They get mad at me because I don't talk much to them. Lately they started threatening to kick me out soon which is my worst fear because I just can't be in public and have no money at all. I really don't know how to cope when that happens. My younger brother (17) isn't any better. He keeps mocking me for being socially inept and laughs whenever I say something. I feel like he only talks to me to get a laugh at my weirdness.nnI also get bad anxiety here even though no one knows who I am... My hands are shaking as I'm typing this text and I will probably end up deleting it right after posting it. :/nnI honestly don't think I can take this much longer. Living in constant fear and depression. Crying every day. Absolutely no perspective in life. I just can't. I really would like to take some medication so I can at least leave the house or also try some therapy if that can still help but I can't leave the house to go to a psychiatrist / therapist let alone interact with them and tell them about my issues. :(nnI think I'm done with my rant... Sorry, just had to let it out somewhere. "
5402,"hotshadow10","post","Can someone assess my situation?","So im 17 years old and about 6 years i have dealt with social anxiety. It all started when i was 11, for some reason one day i started to get so anxious that I was going to hell (stupid right?) and this anxiety caused me to be weird around others because I was constantly thinking about hell. I would be erratic around others and did alot of stupid and awkward stuff. This led to me getting bullied very hard. Being racially made fun of, beat up, name calling. They called me danworm because at that time i had a skin problem with my scalp and i would have lots of dandruff. I also had eczema on my eye and they kept calling it ringworm even though it wasnt (dandruff = dan and ringworm = worm). They called me danworm through the whole 8th grade and my self esteem was at an all time low. The bullying changed my perception on people and I started having trust issues with people. In high school I started avoiding every social situation. My fear of going to hell was gone but I developed a new fear about social situations. Whenever someone tried to talk to me I would tense up and try to end the convo as soon as possible. I thought to myself whats the point of even trying to be social if I know I'm going to be awkward and anxious. I had 0 friends for the entirety of high school. I am now going to college but I am scared because I know I have to be social. I started therapy about a week ago and Im on some anxiety medicine. I'm no longer very anxious in social situations but I avoid all social situations to the point where I just want to stay in my room all day. Is this considered social anxiety or something else? I want to be sure so I can tell my therapist."

The same story over and over again. Everything is a battle. I've come a long way already but i'm still very anxious. I'm currently doing driving lessons, but the fear of doing something wrong and getting a backlash is too much. On my second lesson I did make a mistake and the instructor got said some harsh things. Since then I've felt nervous and stressed every day. That was 3 weeks ago. I've told the instructor and he sort of apologized and would take this into account. When I say stressed I mean being physically unwell, nauseous, less appetite, pure fear. It has subsided to being manageable for now. With that I mean, I won't get hysteric and start crying that I don't want to go anymore.  nnI do try to go out everyday but there's no joy to be found. Nowhere, no hobbies. Everything feels like an uphill battle, and when i've finally won the battle there's an even bigger battle waiting for me. Like my last accomplishment, a 5 months internship, the first day wen't horribly, paralysed by anxiety. The first 4 months were just me trying to survive. The last month I got better, and before I knew it, it was over. Back to isolation, I feel like my progress is gone. In a few weeks I have another internship where the same will probably happen. I know I can go through all the ups and downs and finish my internship and drivers license. But at what cost. I feel like I want to quit. I don't want to live the rest of my life like this. I really want the fear to stop, to experience happiness. But I can't, I'm not suicidal and I will never be. I also don't want to do nothing. Sitting on my pc all day makes me hate myself too. Whatever I do I'm always met by suffering. The last time i've felt happy was when I was drunk 2 years ago. Before that I can't even remember feeling good. There are times when I feel ok but rarely. Most of the time everything feels monotone. I do therapy, just got a gym subscription, I'm trying.  nnTL:DR I'm stuck, I don't want to continue trying, I don't want to stop, I don't want to stay where I am now. I feel forced to suffer."

The biggest thing that triggers my anxiety is being alone in public.  It’s almost impossible for me to go to the mall or shopping anywhere because I constantly feel like everyone is watching me and judging me. Also, the fact I could bump in to anyone from school at anytime is horrifying. I can barely go an hour in the mall without having to take a break and sit down to let my mind calm down. When I’m with my friends, the anxiety I feel is bearable compared to being alone. Also any sort of confrontation, no matter how minor, gives me a panic attack. An example being someone telling me not to run in the halls. I’ll be overthinking what they said for the next half hour calling myself stupid for doing what I did, even if it really doesn’t matter. Sometimes I just want to be invisible. Not to be seen by anyone. This is pretty hard for me though. Because I’m a pretty big dude for my age (5’11, 14 years old). nnMy Anxiety stems from an excessive sweating disorder I have. Many people have made fun of me for it. After my SA got bad, I’ve been called socially inept. I’m starting high school in one week.

I was feeling a little improvment and had no disturbing side effect apart from feeling tired sometimes. nnAfter a month , by mutual agreement with ny doctor , the dose has been increased to 30mg.  It felt like the 15mg , maybe i was feeling a little better , but i was feeling like  I was progressing. Things were stable until recently( So for 4 months)nnTwo weeks ago though, it's like i'm feeling worse than before I started taking the meds. I feel extremely dizzy, sick and feel like im going to throw up everytime i go out. I think im having panic attacks , which ive never had even before taking the meds , thats really wierd.nnI was able to go out , school and etc... rather confortably when I started the meds , but now  , it's like I can't go out at all without feeling sick all of a sudden. nnCould it be because of my medication ? Should I ask for my dosage.to be decreased to 15mg ? nnThanks"

I have always had a shy bladder and have gotten in the habit of holding it for the whole school day. I’ve been trying to change my ways because I’ve realized it’s unhealthy, so I tried drinking more. Then I got screwed over yesterday because there was an incident where we could not leave our classroom. When we finally got out, I decided to use the bathroom but I couldn’t because there were so many other people around. I didn’t get another chance to go so I just waited the day out with a full, aching bladder. Today my stomach has been hurting and so does my pelvis. I also thought I felt pain in my kidney at one point. I’m not sure if I developed a uti from this, I’m paranoid, or just dehydrated. I really hope it’s not a uti because then I’ll have to go to the doctor and my doctor scares me. Has anybody else experienced anything like this? "
5464,"llftpokapr","post","I don’t know anywhere else to ask but here.","Hi, i have no clue if i have this or not. Basically, i want to just describe a few very specific things that happen to me, and hear from someone who has experience. nnI’m still in school and i’m 16. What i will note is that my family does have a pretty strong “tough it out” mentality, and all i will say is that if medical care is not deemed absolutely necessary then usually it would be badly viewed to take a trip to the doctor for something insignificant. I have some stories that seem crazy to me at least of them practicing this. I do genuinely believe anxiety affects my life, but i think i can find ways to deal with social anxiety besides medication for sure. nnSo, the experiences. I will say I have a fairly well put together friend group and i’m a part of 2 main groups of friends really. I have always been a smaller group of friends kind of person, and i’m for sure introverted. I have found that i am extremely fidgety in conversation and just in general awkward, but not to the extent that it’s completely off putting to new people, just seeing me as “weird” and “shy.” I’m scared to crack jokes or say something even remotely interesting because i’m worried they will judge me. Also i always worry about preconceptions of me before i speak to a person in the first place. i’m overly conscious of the way i walk, my accent, and the way my body is positioned because i don’t want to be perceived as weird. Odd, i know. Another thing i will say is that when i’m comfortable with someone i am genuinely at ease for all these things. Especially my long term friends. I crack jokes commonly and i wouldn’t say I’d describe i’m a comedian or anything, but a big thing for all our friends is humor and i feel normal. if we’re not laughing together, then it’s weird or something serious has happened , i’ll put it that way. I’m already feeling this is a wall of text so i’ll try to keep the specific situation short. Basically in classes such as english where we read things together and you can be picked i constantly find myself reading the paragraphs ahead to see any words that i don’t recognize and can trip up on. Well, i was doing this and there were absolutely no words that would trip me up. I was called on for this paragraph to read, and i found myself beet red, and sweating damn near profusely in my seat. My heart felt clinched up sort of and a good bit in (about halfway) my words caught in my throat, and i kind of just stopped for a second and mentally regained my composure because i felt like everyone was listening and meticulously picking apart how i was speaking and the pitch of my voice and such. It seemed like i just stumbled on a word but it still didn’t look good. That incident is what sent me here, because that’s happened since i’ve even been in highschool, and i was always quiet anyways in middle school and before. There are other things to note, but i don’t want this to be TOO long.nnIm really sorry for the wall of text and understand no one reading this or responding, but if someone who knows about this can maybe point me in the right direction of what’s going on if it isn’t social anxiety or give me tips on how to combat this non-medicinally it would be greatly appreciated because i feel like there’s not many other people i can talk to. I can’t really talk to my friends about this, and that sounds weird but they’ll just view me differently after that if it makes sense."

Kind of like when you lightly scratch your fingerprints against the grain if that makes sense.

5494,"lancerlj","post","Why do I feel anxiety when someone asks me a question?","I suffer(ed) from social anxiety. The earliest I remember having it was freshmen year of high school. Before that I just knew I had stage fright and I stuttered occasionally as well, still do.nnI've gotten a lot better and less anxious in social situations since freshmen year though. I am now a senior in high school and I am 18 years old. I go to a counseling session every week. I've been working on my conversational skills and I've been forcing myself to get into conversations with almost anyone that I come in contact with. It's definitely helping.nnI've decided since it's my senior year I want to have fun, go all out, fucking send it and expand my social network. I want to meet more people in my school and have more people know me. I'm trying to speak up more in class and answer questions out loud.nnHowever there's one thing that I just can't seem to overcome yet. It's when I get asked a question. It doesn't even have to be in a conversation. It's just whenever I hear someone ask me something my first thought isn't the answer to the question. My first thought is whether I'll look stupid if I don't know the answer or not, because that leads to my biggest insecurity: my face getting red as shit.nnI believed it to be the sole reason why I had SAD in the first place. I thought for a while that if my face wouldn't turn red then I would be cured because that's all I worry about. Unfortunately it's not true because I still get anxious even when the other person can't see my face (ex. on the phone, in a dark room). Now don't get me wrong, taking the blushing face out of the equation tremendously boosts my confidence and lessens my anxiety, it's just not the only thing that causes it.nnAnyways I hate it when I feel and get that tensed up facial expression. It's like the face when someone is trying to hold their tears in or the face in a really awkward situation. I get that when someone asks me a question, I get it right before my face starts to blush. The rational part of my brain will actually try to find an answer while the imbalanced fucked neurons or whatever in my brain will try to convince me that I'm in a dangerous situation. Therefore my face will get tensed up and my face will blush. If it's a lengthy conversation with multiple questions stacked being thrown at me like fucking discs and I somehow have to catch them all at once (literally how I feel), then my armpits and back will sometimes even get sweaty. That's why for now I try to keep the conversation topic on the other person or something that won't arouse a question. It's an all-out war in my head.nnNow here's the fun part. It doesn't happen with everyone, it doesn't happen all the time and it doesn't happen with every question. nnObviously if my mother asks me a question about what I want for dinner my back isn't gonna get all sweaty. Same with any first family member. It also won't happen if I'm not intimidated by the other person. For example if I'm talking to a 10 year old I'm not going to be nervous. However if I'm talking to an attractive female and she asks me what my plans are for after high school... holy fuck that's like a nuclear bomb just went off in my head. For attractive girls it's definitely the most intimidating for me on the list. After them it's bullies, popular kids, strangers, teachers and so on. My generalized everyday common shyness and nervousness fuels my anxiety.nnNow it doesn't happen all the time. I can be in a super confident mood for some reason and I won't feel any anxiety when asked a question. Sometimes it'll just be a little bit, most times it'll be a whole lot though. It's unpredictable because I don't know how to put myself in a confident mood all of the time. It's just random.nnIf someone asks me how old I am my face won't get red. If someone asks me what my favorite color is I probably won't feel anxiety (unless I think that it's leading to follow up questions). It's the questions where you have to answer with a little bit more of a elaboration.nnSo these three things determine how bad my anxiety will get in a social situation. They fuel each other, or they negate each other. For example if I'm talking to an attractive girl but i'm in a super confident mood and she's only asking little questions, then I probably won't feel anxious. However if I'm talking to an attractive girl and I'm just in a normal mood and she's asking me about the meaning of life then that would literally be world war 3 in my head. nnI haven't had a anxiety/panic attack in a while because of my effort in trying to overcome it. I use to have them bad though, right in the middle of the conversation too. I would blush, start choking up and I would get flustered and not know what to say. I now have strategies for that. It's just for some reason answering questions is the one of the last things on my list that I need to overcome! nnThanks a lot!nntl:dr - i get anxious when someone asks me a question and my face tenses up and will get red. however it depends on the type of person i'm talking to and what questions they're asking and what mood i'm in nnnnnnn"

So In order to overcome my anxious self and to  become more confident I began  to work out more, eat  healthy and meditate.

When I look at myself in the mirror afterwards I think it's not as bad as I thought, and this happened countless times it's insane, now it's everytime I go to the university. On top of all this I find it so hard to make friends, and this only happened when I started uni, I'm obviously an introvert but on top of that I always isolate myself, I don't like going to someone and starting a conversation because I always assume they would think like me and hate someone else doing that to them, that maybe I would bother them. Not to mention girls that I find so hard to start and maintain a conversation with, and when one does I pretend I don't care (while getting an anxiety attack), yet I get attached so easily for the stupidest things, getting rejected twice certainly didn't help, but I only blame myself because I handle situations like those so badly. nnSorry for rambling too much but I had to, this is affecting my life and it will be ruined if I don't fix it.

I’ve had social anxiety for about as long as I can remember, and it’s always been a huge problem.nn Today in math, we were doing a worksheet, and the teacher told us to do it in groups of max 3. I only have one friend in that class, and other people seemed to be working alone, so I decided to as well. She then came up to me and asked me why I wasn’t working with others. I told her that I worked better alone, and she told me to go find a group anyway. I felt so awkward, and the only people I knew in the class were already working in groups of 3. I tried working up the courage to ask someone else, but then panicked and ended up not doing it. She gave me a huge lecture in front of the class about how I have to be more willing to collaborate with others and the entire class looked at me, while I started half-crying. I sat with my friend for the rest of the period but I think I embarrassed her because no one wants to be forced to work with the awkward, shy girl.nnMy teacher pulled me outside after class and tried to give me a therapy session. She was really nice about it, but I ended up crying in front of her anyway while her daughter (who gossips a lot) watched in the background. I just feel so embarrassed. I know it’s my fault for not socializing, but I do t want to ever go back to that class."

Unfortunately, this is a problem I haven't truly tackled these issues in an honest manner. I have dealt my entire life with fear of work and performance and a fear of talking to others, especially girls, and an overall quite severe irrational inferiority complex and fear of humiliation. I've always been considered very gifted, and my way of tackling this has been though stimulating my intellectual curiosity. I'll spend an entire day alone watching some documentary about politics, listening to podcasts, reading a difficult book in my bed etc. etc - a very very stupid way of handling it and has let to self pity and building up my all to comfortable comfort zone. Even playing computer games with other people can be a challenge if there is a possibility that my intelligence or competence could be questioned. This does not only feed the positive feedback loop of social anxiety and lack of confidence, making it more and more difficult to climb out of this vicious circle. I've been to a psychologist multiple times and take some anti-stress/anxiety medicine. I've tried to maintain a normal jobs with collegues, but the negative thoughts seem to defeat by courage every time - no one seems to care for my well being, and I start perceiving social arenas as places of hierarchy and power manifestation. The fact that I've always been considered gifted doesn't help either since I'm very clumsy in administrative and practical stuff, which puts me at bigger risk of ridiculing myself and constantly discouraging me. I've tried to remember to analyze my thoughts and ridding myself of negative irrationality, but with very limited success in practice. I feel like I have a lot of potential and ambition, but it's so difficult to overcome those hurdles that it takes to realize my potential. I need to move forward and overcome these fears. I need more encouragement. I need to realize my potential and live a responsible and meaningful life."

Where I felt like all my anxiety and worries quite literally melted away, I played a startegic multiplayer game and ended up leading in voice chat  and feeling confident (yes that's a big thing for me since I'm usually shy from social contact), and i was so focused even tho I was sleep deprived somehow and ended up doing insanely good, and then to actually  test my limits I went outside. I have some weird anxiety from the street where I feel like someone might attack me randomly or a stray dog might chase me lol, i went to the super market and i bought a few sodas and it was so weird how I didn't  feel ""scared"" and didn't  have to calculate how I'm  gonna fight random people if they  start attacking me lmao.

Could  it be possible  that I have anxiety and my doctor thinks I have adhd because  of it (even tho I basically have a the symptoms).nnn Sorry for the long post I'm  just a little weirded out.

I was decently outgoing, joined a fraternity, and was having a good time. I don't know where everything went wrong but now i'm 21, a junior, and I hate college. I can never can bring myself to do anything because of nerves and anxiety. Every time my roommates successfully drag me to the bar, I leave within 20 minutes because the first awkward silence or awkward interaction I have makes me completely shut down and want to go home. Even with people I've been friends with for years, I can barely hold a good conversation with anymore, it doesn't feel natural like it used to. I'm starting to feel them getting irritated. I don't think they understand why I'm like this now either and I think they're starting to give up on reaching out and asking me to do things. I get so uncomfortable and nervous so fast and its so frustrating because I didn't use to be like this and it only points to getting worse. And of course as I'm sure all of you reading this subreddit know, thinking about it after just makes the anxiety worse. I get anxiety about my anxiety. It's a vicious cycle. My drinking and drug use (just marijuana now, I quit xanax last year) is the only thing that I want to do even though I know it is horribly unhealthy and making things worse. I'm just miserable and can't turn my brain off when I'm sober. I originally thought that maybe it was the xanax that was fucking up my anxiety but its been over a year since I took a xanax last and my anxiety is worse if anything. I saw a doctor today and she suggested I see a therapist and prescribed me zoloft but I'm not sure my family can afford these things. I'm just not sure what to do but something has to change and I was just wondering if anyone experienced something similar to this in college and has any advice. "

I’ve never had a girlfriend (kissless, hugless virgin) and haven’t made a proper friend in as long as I can remember, neither of which bother me anymore. I have just a couple friends that don’t live in the same town as me and I prefer it that way.nnI struggled through high school well aware of my social anxiety, with the mindset that I would be dealing with it forever, but it didn’t bother me like it does now because I made myself believe I would somehow use my intelligence (top of my school) to somehow earn a living without having to interact daily. Since then I dropped out of university because I couldn’t handle the social interaction, and I worked at my parent’s small business that I also had to quit because I couldn’t handle the interaction with fellow employees. I’ve tried extensively to make money online too but that has only been a waste of money so far and now I have no more to invest. Now I’m coming to the realization that there are no jobs I can do that don’t involve any interaction at all with others. I’m expecting to hear that I should just get a job and it will supposedly help my social anxiety due to exposure: I’ve exposed myself enough to know it’s an immense effort for no reward, I just go right back to avoiding everyone in no time. And counseling, counseling is the biggest joke I’ve ever heard; if I was insane it may help in some way to help me organize my thoughts, but I am well aware of my options. The way I see it, I have two. I can force myself to live my life with this condition, living in misery as I force myself through social interactions, counseling and a hundred different pills with weird side effects, or I can end my life here which I see to be valid strategy. I just don’t think it’s worth all the effort and suffering I’d have to go through just to experience the good things in life, that does not make me depressed. Once my parents die I feel I can justify suicide, everyone else that cares should realize it’s my decision. If there was a job available for people allowing zero social interaction my life would be set."

Anytime I'd get called on, I'd blush. If I saw someone in public that I knew, say at the grocery store, I'd blush. If someone asked me a question I wasn't expecting, I'd blush. The list goes on.nn&amp;#x200B;nnFast forward and I'm 24 now. Male. Been lifting seriously for 8 years, so I keep myself in great shape. I have a great job. I should have no reason to be embarrassed over anything, right? I'm fine with speaking to people. The thing is, I just have a fear of blushing. I know I'm going to blush over NOTHING, and just the thought of blushing makes me go red. It's miserable!nn&amp;#x200B;nnBasically, this happens for no reason at all and I consciously know that. Yet, I can't stop the blushing. I have never went to therapist and tried out Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. nn&amp;#x200B;nn2 weeks ago I had a panic attack at work over the blushing crap. I left work and went straight to Urgent Care after I had calmed down a little bit. I went to UC just because they're never busy and I wanted something to help my anxiety. I was nervous telling the doctor that I have a blushing problem and yep, you guessed it! I blushed when I was telling her I have a problem with blushing, haha.nn&amp;#x200B;nnShe prescribed me Propranolol, which is a beta blocker. Mine are 20mg tablets (you can get a higher dose.) She told me to take 1/2 of a tablet whenever I feel like my anxiety is out of control. 10mg worked... meh. I went ahead and took the full 20mg tablet a day later before work, which is where I blush like crazy.nn&amp;#x200B;nnSomeone had asked me a semi-personal question that I've been asked about before and which also makes me blush like no other. I could feel the anxiety/blood rush up my chest and right about when it hit my neck area, it just stopped. My face didn't go red! It just came to a halt. It was miraculous. I was thrilled.nn&amp;#x200B;nnSo, I just wanted to tell people about this, because I've been dealing with chronic blushing for over 10 years. It's insane that this has helped with that so much. It gives me more confidence. It's truly amazing.nn&amp;#x200B;nnHowever, this probably isn't a long term solution for people. I would suggest asking a doctor about Propanolol and how you want to give it a trial run, 10 days or so. I would also suggest to seek out a therapist that can administer Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Be completely straightforward and honest when talking about your blushing. It's natural that we do this and you're not the only one with the problem. We can get rid of it. I'm finally going to seek therapy myself and kick this to the curb.nn&amp;#x200B;nnGood luck!"

5596,"geongangehanchohda","post","What kind of bodily anxiety symptoms do you get and how do you go about dealing with them? This is the most difficult part of my anxiety.","I’m 24 years old and have had social anxiety as far back as I can remember, and it manifests in many different ways in my body that I can’t control. These are the hardest parts of my anxiety since I can’t control them and they’re the parts that are immediately visible to people. Some examples of this are my extremely shy bladder, where I cannot urinate if I know someone can hear me, especially someone I know well or in situations where I’m expected to go quickly and return to whatever I was found before. It’s pretty terrible and I’ve not been able to get over it throughout my entire adult life. nnAnother example is when my face turns very red whenever a lot of attention is given to me. I can’t control this and it makes it hard to hide whenever I’m annoyed or angry or embarrassed by something, even if I don’t want to show my emotions. nnAnother is how I cannot dance or sing in front of people without totally locking up. This is one that probably effects me the most, as it causes me to avoid any situations where I might be pressured to dance or sing. nnLastly I sometimes can’t control my facial expressions in times of confrontation with other people. If someone is angry at me or if I am being asked something in a high pressure situation, like in an exam or by my boss about something, my mouth shakes and the corners of my mouth sort of droop down. It’s difficult to describe. It’s like my mouth sort of shakes and I can’t control it and I feel like I’ll tear up. I usually never actually tear up but I can feel my mouth moving. The only non-anxiety related time this happened to me was when I was young and jumped into a cold creek that I wasn’t expecting there to be a strong current in. I remember my mouth moving uncontrollably in almost the same way while I was swimming to the shore of the creek. It’s an odd comparison but they were almost the exact feeling of losing control over my body. nnWhen I really think about it, this is what my anxiety is truly about and it’s the physical things that I can’t control that have basically rendered me a totally different person than what I’d like to be. This anxiety has had such deep effects on my life and in my relationships throughout my life. nnI wish I knew a way to fix these things. I don’t live in a country where I have good access or support for therapy right now, so basically anything is up to me. It almost feels like these things are so deeply rooted in me that therapy isn’t enough. I was on anti-anxiety medication for a few years and while it helped with the emotional aspect of it, it never helped with the physical parts. I’m not depressed either, as I’ve gotten used to this for the most part. It just causes a lot of uncomfortable situations on a regular basis for me. nnThe only thing that I’ve found that’s ever helped with these things was MDMA when I took it a couple times before. Those brief moments were the only times where I felt free from the cage this anxiety feels like to me. nnHas anyone else felt this way before? I’ve never met anyone in my life with symptoms like mine, though many people I’ve met said they have social anxiety. "

When I was younger I was always shy but I could be social with practically anyone once I got used to them. This behavior persisted until middle school, when family issues began to start and an unfortunate cancer diagnosis that left my mother dead. This was very hard on me. In addition to that my father began heavily drinking and doing drugs which eventually led to him leaving us. Middle school/High school was rough, my stutter, self -counsciousness, and lack of confidence left me quite shy. However, I always had friends, but beyond them I never felt I could branch off and meet new people on my own. I never even had a real girlfriend throughout high school just many flings. Now I'm 20 in college and things seemed to of only gotten worse. My stutter has worsened and my anxiety is through the fucking roof.

I was happy to be invited and happier that I didn't avoid going, which was my original instinct, but that wasn't enough to outweigh how terrible I felt throughout the night. First off, though it was expected, the reception I got disappointed me. Out of about 20 people there, only 7 made an effort to converse with me and only about 4-5 really materialized. Even those conversations were squandered far too early due to me getting to in my head and my inability to go beyond surface level details.nnBut worse than that was how helpless I felt. When I tried to contribute to larger group dialogue, I found myself totally overwhelmed. Everyone was talking about how they've visited different places and all these interesting stories about cool things they've done recently. Somehow I don't think talking about how I'm sometimes afraid to leave my apartment compares to the stuff they've done. The only time I could really contribute is if people were talking about high school. And why would they do that when they all have so many more interesting stories from college and after? I was totally miserable all night listening to how much everyone else has grown over the years while I've gone downhill. I also had an underlying feeling that people were making fun of me at times throughout the night. Not in a super malicious way, but shitty nonetheless. It really felt like I was a fourth tier friend to everyone and a total sympathy invite.nnAnother thing that really sucks is that I have no one to blame but myself. Several people from high school were around the same spot as me socially as we went to college. They've progressed, I've regressed. Can't blame where I grew up. Many kids of the same race as me who are doing a lot better than I am. Can't blame my culture. My younger brother is a social butterfly compared to me. Knows tons of people. Hangs out with friends multiple times a week and has a ton of connections. Can't blame my parents. And I'm at least average looking. Can't blame my looks.nnI'm never going to say that things can't change, but my lack of experience and confidence will be monumental hurdles to overcome. My hope will always be there, but I'm not confident I can change my social life for the better right now. Does anyone who came from a similar place have any success stories/inspiration?"

I wouldn't talk to anyone outside of my immediate family, and if I did, it would probably take 5-6 years or more for me to warm up to them. nnI started college at 19, having had absolutely zero friends my entire life. I could spend entire days not speaking to anyone, to the point where my throat would hurt if I did. I thought I was a failure and would never get a job - how could I, if I can't even speak? But, I loved Psychology, I dreamt of ""saving people"", and I would NOT let this fear conquer me. So I started grad school. I had one-two friends the first year, I was like a toddler! Fights over petty things, I just couldn't understand how to... ""human"". It's like I had to learn at 19 what people learned at five. But I managed. Now I think I made 30+ friends. I'm probably one of the most liked members of my class. But I still SUCK at public speaking.nnI become red (not cute blushing, it looks like a rash), I stumble, I forget, my eyes water. It looks like I'm having a stroke. And I managed to skip presentations ALL of five years! Now, the thing is, I want to face this. I'm great 1x1 with my patients, but I want to give presentations, teach courses! How could I defend a thesis like this? No way. So I wonder, are paid public speaking classes any good? Not the college ones. The ones from schools that have it as a focus. Or is it ""too much too soon""? Does anyone have experience with it? "
5619,"LividLibrarian","post","Can someone help me understand?","My entire life I've felt constantly anxious about everything. I can barely even talk to my own family most of the time. The thing is sometimes I get really confident and I can present or do whatever and not care at all, but I still can't just talk to someone. I've been with my girlfriend for about 2 months and I can have a conversation with her over text but I can still barely talk to her when we talk in person. Only recently have I even been able to post on forums and stuff even anonymously due to a fear of talking to people. Not a single person knows what my favorite song is. I can act confident and the weird thing is I could go up and say something to someone pretty easily, but I probably couldn't have a 2 way conversation with them, yet sometimes I can. I could go up and present something easily, but most of the time I can't talk to a close friend except for joking around. I honestly don't know what triggers me to feel nervous, my heart just feels fluttery (in a bad way) and my stomach will start to hurt when talking to people, but only sometimes. One thing I do know is i get more nervous talking to females (even if i'm not attracted to them at all, even my own mom), but that's really the only specific thing I can say makes me nervous.

5629,"Alosar","post","Social Anxiety Is Ruining My Life","I've always had problems talking to people and forming interpersonal relationships, but it's now at a point where it's safe to say that it is ruining my life. nnI only have two people that I somewhat regularly talk to, because they're friends from all the way back in elementary school. My family life is fucked, I live alone in a small apartment and talk to them only very occasionally. The only person from my family that I have a deeper connection with is my twin sister, who however has moved to the other side of the country, so I only see her very rarely. Even she doesn't know of the full extent of my anxiety and depression, I think she just thinks that's just who I am. nnI just turned 21 now and I'm about to finish up an internship at an IT company, that I luckily got not because of my social skills, but because I was top of my class and they offered it to me because of that. Just like with every other job/school I've been to before though, I talk to no one unless it's absolutely necessary and I have to do it because of the job. I feel uncomfortable and don't feel like I can relate to anyone there, even though they're not bad people or anything.nnNow my supervisor came up to me last Friday and told me that while I do my job well, I won't be able to get a full time position after the internship (which was the mutual plan from the start) because of my lacking social skills and me not talking to anyone. This honestly didn't surprise me that much, but it still hit me like a brick. I was trying to hold back tears and felt completely dumbstruck for the rest of the day, not because I want the job so desperately, but because this is the nail in the coffin in my realization that my social anxiety is absolutely ruining my life. nnI am dealing with depression because of how miserable my life is and because of how terrible it feels to miss out on life. Life is passing me by and I watch every year go by with minimal change. I've never even kissed a girl, I spend most of my time playing computer games or browsing the internet, because I have nothing else to do. The thought of engaging in social activity, let alone go to parties or something, ignites instant panic in me.nnThe thing is that my supervisor offered to give me one last chance to better my social behavior in the remaining 1.5 months of my internship. He's surprisingly nice considering that most people usually write off my social anxiety as ignorance, and I don't hold a grudge against him for not wanting to employ me, I honestly probably wouldn't employ myself either. He recommended me to join an acting club because he believes that would help, but honestly that just made me panic and I can't even see myself doing something like this. I think I literally couldn't do it. He said I should think about it over the weekend.nnSo what do I do? I can't see myself joining an acting club, the thought of that alone frightens me and I think I would only leave even more retreated in my shell. But if I say no that would show them that I'm not trying to better myself. The thought of seeing a therapist sounds more promising to me, there would be less pressure and I could try to figure myself out as to why I am like this. I definitely think it has to do with past experiences in my life, I developed trust issues from an abusive mother that might have developed into me not being able to get personal with anybody.nnThen again I started questioning if it might be better if I don't even try to stay at that company after the internship. People there, while nice, already have the impression of me being a freak, and the longer I know people the harder it is to be myself around them after all this time. I might need a fresh start or just some time off for myself to really self reflect and get a handle on things. I just want to start living and stop this endless cycle of mundane existence. Regardless, tomorrow I have to tell my supervisor what I have envisioned for the future, and I still don't know.nnAny advice is appreciated, especially if you've been or are still going through the same things.

Why ? Well, let me introduce you to my problems.nn  nI'm unable to hold any kind of conversation, heck, (if I had one) I could sit in a room with my best friend for 24hrs, and if he/she wouldn't approach me it would be 24hrs of silence. Even if someone approaches me, the conversation usually either ends very quickly or gets extremely awkward after like 30 seconds. Oh and I also avoid people completely whenever I can, usually locking myself in the school bathroom, most of the times even for like 3 hours until class begins again.  nThe next thing is the fact that I'm literally unable to have any physical body contact with someone. It's extremely awkward for me to even hug or shake hands with a family member, the people I've been living with together for 16 years now, and hugging a person I only know for some time (that includes basically everything from the time after I was born to now) is completely impossible for me. The same thing goes with hand holding, kissing, or even more intimate things.  nnnI highly doubt that any kind of person would want a relationship with someone that basically ignores him/her all day, is unable to engage in any body contact and usually just sits there doing nothing, also resulting in the fact that dates / meetups are also impossible (apart from other problems like my mental health, not having any interests, hobbies etc. making a relationship basically impossible to begin with).nn&amp;#x200B;nnI guess I'm doomed after all, as I don't really want any therapy.

I started this past Tuesday but had been sick through the beginning of the week as well as sleep-deprived (mostly due to anxiety but also sickness). Anyways, today I meet this girl due to circumstance and we start walking around campus and talking. After talking for a bit I learned she graduated high school pretty young and was already a senior (from what a gathered this girl was only 19, maybe 20); and of course on top of that, I found her attractive, so already I'm already struggling to hold conversation because I just find her amazing. We keep talking and she doesn't seem too bothered by me, (we ended getting lunch together and talking for another hour before she had to leave for class). Just as a side-note this is the third girl I have talked to in college and the other two were almost exactly like this girl; they had all been through pretty traumatic shit in their past, this girl had lost her boyfriend (I didn't ask how, as to not be rude) and her mother was diagnosed with cancer. So, I just had this immense respect for her as I had for these other two women on top of everything else mentioned earlier.nn&amp;#x200B;nnSo I end up exchanging numbers with this girl which is where my already growing anxiety just goes ballistic. I make one shitty joke, begin to think about how poorly it went with the other two girls, start thinking about how awkward I must have been at lunch; since I was sick and sleep deprived I wasn't exactly sharp, on top of the way I had almost immediately felt about this girl. Just, shit starts piling up which in turn starts making me feel more depressed and anxious than normal ; and when I get back from school I get home and my body aching, I have a headache and I can't stop thinking about this girl. I keep thinking what's wrong with me for being here again; and, even if it were possible, do I need a friend or something more (I had just recently lost my best friend of 20 years and had been feeling more lonely than ever this past year), so I'm just currently a mess; I honestly just don't want to mess this up and be friends with this girl but can't help feel like I did something wrong or said something really stupid (we've stopped texting each other so I'm probably reading into that too much as well), but I'm really unsure what to do.

I can't tell my parents because I know I'm not that weak and I would feel very bad if I tell them about that (also, I can't imagine myself going to the psychiatrist). It's hard for me to even live with my parents because they are restricting the time I need to get home when I'm out with my friends, they force me to go to church against my will and stuff like that. Trying to chat with them isn't going to help because I tried it several times and nothing changed (I only made them angry and mad). I am 100% conscious of my problems. I can't even fully describe what my problem really is because there are many. Head tremor is just one of them and probably the worst I have to deal with. Most of the time, when I look someone in the eyes, my head starts to shake (anxiety starts to kick in) and I feel very nervous. In the beginning I wasn't paying much attention to it, but now it shakes so bad that everyone notices. I am addicted to porn (I had a streak of 45 days of noPMO and I relapsed, today I'm starting again and there is nothing that will stop me this time). I do workout 3 times a week.

For a little while now I've always worried that my friends hate me whenever I make new friends. Now it's getting worse and I'm just worried that I'm annoying and everyone hates me. I've realized that I'm the first one to text, I'm the only one to suggest hanging out, and I'm usually the first one to go up to people and start conversations in school. I overthink every single little interaction, with my friends yes, but also with the girl I like. She is also my friend, but it's the same situation as I listed above, I'm the first to text her or talk to her or whatever. How can I help this? And with all the stuff I just said, does it sound like they actually do hate me?"

I know it didn’t show to my peers, but i always found it hard to focus on anybody or anything else other then my own mental state. I can’t relate to people no matter how hard I tried. So my friendgroup was always tight knit, and half of the time I couldn’t fully care about them because i was so focused on trying to make myself happy. I haven’t been a really good friend to a friend in highschool. I couldn’t relate to her half of the time. I always felt strained and trying to figure it out but it never worked. We haven’t spoken in 6 months and today is my birthday. She used to always do sweet things on my birthday but now I haven’t heard a word from her. I know that distance is normal after highschool but i cant help but feel like crap about it. I always feel so guilty about everything especially how i treated her, she knows about my social anxiety but i still feel like its my responsibility. I don’t want to reach out to her or anything because i’m afraid its too late and she wants me to stop beating the dead goat."

I'm a 25 year old female, and I get really distracted by other women's breasts in conversation. I feel an immense amount of shame about this in my day-to-day life. This has been going on for at least a couple of years.nnI'm bi, which I repressed as long as possible, and I've never experimented with a woman. So I'm wondering if I'm going through some sort of male-puberty-like fascination with breasts? Because it doesn't matter if I have any attraction to the woman or not. If I can see the outline of their breasts, it is distracting to me.nnIt could also be partially caused by my insecurity with the size my own breasts. They are smallish, and I don't know how to stop comparing mine to everyone else's.nnI've Googled this problem before and found the suggestion of focusing on the other person's eye color or eyebrows. But then I get nervous that I can only look at one eyebrow or eye at a time, lol. And, I still feel like I might accidentally be glancing, even though I'm trying not to. I know that there's a difference between ogling and glancing, but I feel like I might be glancing a lot? nnI just feel so awful about all of this. I never want to make anyone feel uncomfortable in any way or treat them like a piece of meat. I find myself getting really depressed about this and avoiding social interaction with other women as much as possible. nnI know I definitely need therapy, haha. But I'm also reaching out to see if any other women actually have the same problem. Or to learn how men cope with it. I'd appreciate any help I can get. Thank you"
5681,"Apw11","post","My story","Includes social anxiety, body dysmorphia and incel. nnEnglish is not my native language, so u can read some weird words.nnI will try to ´´summarize´´ this (at the bottom, there is a real summary).nnAs a child, when i was around 11, i was really attractive to everyone. I know this because at school, i got all the girls chasing me, and so outside. Obviously, i was too young to ´´benefit´´ on this. At that age, i remember myself as an outgoing kid,  that had friends and did some regular stuff. Later on, something happened. I think that the inflection point was the haircut that i started wearing, the classic mushroom haircut that a lot of kids wear...with the difference that i was a teenager already. From  being a young Adonis, i started to hear the mock of some girls, through the nicknames that they put on me, refered to my haircut. All my friends started having some interactions with girls, while i was just staring, too afraid of rejection. That was the beginning of my fearful existence, and it continued (with ups and downs) until my current age of 25.nnSo yeah, right now i feel like i didnt live at all. I never had a girlfriend, i only have 1 friend that i meet every few months, i never had a job and never been to a party. This decade has been a mix of playing World of Warcraft, doing sport (cycling and calisthenics, obv individual sports), and studying some random useless shit that my mother suggested me to. I feel like it doesnt matter what i study, since there is people in almost every single profession. Ive studied hostelry and quitted it cos its too customer-facing. Ive studied sport and physical activity animator...but it was only because i like to practice it, im too insecure for teaching or doing anything in fron of a group. Now i switched to programming...but seems that im too autistic even for the nerd-world, since the teacher already told me that i have to learn to participate more while working in a groupal project...but i just end up excluding myself.nn Sport is what saved me through all this time. When im at home, i cant stop thinking about the past and the future, and i listen a lot of depressing music. So i need to take a ride on my bike almost every day. Im prety good at it and its hard to think about random shit when you are under big physical effort.nnI consider myself a good interlocutor, but i only can show this in individual conversations. In a group (specially if i dont know the members), im unable to articulate a single word unless someone ask my oponion directly. This is hard for me, because everybody that ever meet me, told me that im a very witty person and i can contribute to the conversation. Im really quick at making word games. Somebody once told me that i should try rap battles. And i would...if i could articulate a fucking word in front of groups of strangers -.-º. Because of this witty personality, i know that people want me in their groups, and i got invited to random plans and parties many times...but always refused. I just cant stop thinking about little details that throw me back: what if i have to dance, what if they wanna take photos, what if my clothes are not suitable...And so, for me, saturday is just another weekday to play WoW and do some sport...nnI once challenged myselft to go to a psychologist. Since the first session was free and it was one to one conversation, i thought i had no excuse. It went pretty well, she got really interested in me, because we talked for an hour and a half (the session had one hour) and she even invited me to come for another free session and to pay whatever amount i could for the next ones. Not to vary, i rejected...nnAs to relationships, ive always been on this dating webs, but it has been useless because my profile photos sucks. I hate being photographed, i dont want to recognize myself on the pics(i think im much better in person) .I always have the same 3 pics from a specific angle and blurry. I consider myself pretty good at flirting, but if the profile pic is not attractive, u wont get the chance to start a conversation. And so, i didnt meet a single girl this way.nnWell...i actually met one. It was on a social anxiety forum. We exchanged numbers. I could see her picture, but she couldnt see mine, so everything was ok xD. She was really pretty, which surprised me(even more, when i discovered that she had like 1k followers on IG). We chatted for a week straight, it was amazing. One day, she asked me to meet in real life, which is really hard for me, but after those conversations, i thought there was feeling between us, so i accepted.nnWe met in a bar. She was really beautiful irl, but not as perfect as in those IG pics, which i liked even more. At first, we were kinda nervous, but the beer made its effect and we talked for hours.It was getting late and she suggested me to pass the night in my house. Im naive, but i think i know what this kind of proposition means...Still it was a terrible idea, cos i live with my mom. Dont know how and why, i ended up accepting. Before arriving to my house, i thorowed up(cos i smoked, and that makes me sick most of the times). Once in my house, my mom woke up...Well, we ended up sleeping on the same bed, but nothing could have happened cos i was too wasted X_X. Surprisingly, she wanted to keep meeting with me, and we met one more time, a few months later.nnThe most remarkable about this one, is that we kissed. It was a really quick and cold experience, so i dont even consider it as i ever kissed. The fact that she kissed me (obv it was she who went for it) without passion, meant a lot for me. The next day, i told her to break up, because i was getting feelings, and she told me that she only was looking for friendship. She insisted in meeting again, but i rejected. That was the last time i had something with a girl, two years ago. And this is how i learned that u cant have social anxiety and 1k followers on IG by posting pics of your body. Ive cried a lot after that break up, and now im again on that numb state that everything is bad, but not enough to cry...nnHow do i know that i have body dysmorphia.nnSimple: because im the supreme textrovert. I feel very secure when it comes to written comunication (more on my native language). I consider myself good at flirting (i know how to tease) and i use to troll a lot (even whole groups of people), specially the people that cry about their situation or blame others. Everything is ok as long as they dont see a picture of me. One really strange thing is that, in videogames, i never been able to speak through a microphone, which is a requirement for doing a lot of fun stuff. So i ended up being a loner even in videogames. Add that to my completism (im obsessed with achieving everything that is achievable in the games (and irl too)).nnOverall, i think i have a really great body, specially because i practiced several sports for more than ten years, Im 1.85 height, 70kg with very lean muscles and long legs. My hair is of an amazing quality and my haircut now is an upgraded version of the mushroom style that i think began everything xD. It makes me look younger. I dont like a lot of things about my face, but i think it has some personality. And down there, im slightly over the average.nnOn the other hand, lets talk about what i dont like and what keeps me locked in this mental prison. I dont like my short arms, it makes me feel inferior in some sports (i feel like i have to be the best in everything). I actually started thinking that people with short arms are doomed, or something like that :/. I dont like my nose and how it looks when i smile (thats why i never smile in photos) I dont like how my hair looks when its wet, and the fordyce spots on my lips. I got the fordyce spots down there, too. They are harmless small white sebaceous bumps under the skin. Despite being well endowed, i focus more on the spots and the form of my D, which i dont like neither. Ive been watching porn for more than ten years, and it changes yourself physically and mentally. I cant stop comparing myself to the men that appear on the videos. nnI know almost everything about my conditions and my ´´flaws´´, because ive been reading shit about them for too long. The conclusion is that there is no magical solution, u just have to accept yourself. I read a lot about spirituality, too. Thats why i know that my goal in this life is to trascend this extreme identification with the body. To kill the ego, to live in the moment...but God, its been more than ten years and i didnt perceive much progress...I even know the techniques (meditation, self love affirmations, etc), but i end up thinking about the bad things. I still have hope, tho, and dont even contemplate suicide, because i would have to learn the lesson on the next life.nnJesus, its tooking me the whole weekend to write this...with huge breaks, of course. Im such a perfectionist that i have to think a lot before before writing a line, then rewrite it...and i dont even like the final result.nnIf you made it here: congratulations, you really deserve a prize xD!nnHere is the summary of this bible.nnI feel that i have a lot of amazing attributes, Physically im very fit because ive been practicing differen sports for more than ten years. Ive got a strong personality and witty sense of humor, as people say. Im good at flirting, too.nnBut i just can show it. I isolate myself every time, reject invitations to social plans and let go a lot of chaces. I do this because im terrified of other peoples judgements, specially towards my body (in the supreme textrovert). Im very insecure sexually because of the classic fordyce spot issue.nnNow the real questions.nnDoes anyone identify to this? Did anyone overcome a similar situation or have any advices? Do anyone wanna share his story?nnThx 4 reading!"

I'm a junior in a college and for the longest time whenever I would get an invite to a party or someone would try to invite me to hang out or whatever, I would get so anxious and I would say no.

So say you were having trouble with talking to people you don't know, you would practice this while medicated over the course of the treatment, weaning off the medication until  the   psychological stigma associated with triggers is gone.

I’ve always been shy, but have really isolated myself over the last 6 years. I used to have some friends in high school, but admittedly haven’t done a good job of nurturing any of those relationships. It is also hard since most of them have moved away. I didn’t make any friends in college. I think I ended up using academics as an excuse for neglecting my social life. After graduating, I was really stressed out about finding a job. That too, was the task I put most of my energy into, putting socialization aside. I have since started a long-term career, and now I’m realizing how out of touch my social skills are. I don’t have to interact with people very often at work due to the nature of my job, but the interactions I do have to engage in are sometimes excruciating.nnDuring those interactions I experience very rapid heart rate, pit in stomach, dry mouth, and cold sweat to name a few physical symptoms. I mainly want to find a partner for a long-term relationship, but I realize I should probably smaller and work on friendships first. I do yoga, exercise, and meditation every day, as well as keeping a fairly healthy diet to help the anxiousness, but of course active socialization is the most important thing I should be doing.nnI sort of just don’t even know where to start. I remember not ever trying to make the friends I used to have in high school; granted it is also 7 hours a day seeing many people consistently, under situations of almost forced socialization. Now that I have a full time job, I go sit in my cubicle for most of the day, seeing my other few coworkers occasionally for meetings and such. My coworkers are also much older than I am and in very different life situations (married with kids). There is someone I knew that started working in the building recently, that I talk with occasionally. He asked if I wanted to go out to lunch one time, and I accepted, but it’s impossible to make it back in the amount of time I have for lunch and I hate eating in front of people for some reason, so I can’t do that again. I have seen many suggestions for platforms like meetup, but there are not many in my area with my interests and very few people have attended the ones I have looked at. Eventually I decided I was going to go to a yoga class. I bought pass online, got changed and went to walk out the door… and just got stuck. I don’t know how else to describe it, other than I just couldn’t. It’s like my body goes on autopilot and just retreats when I try to do something.nnI have never been in a serious relationship before. I kind of dated one girl over the course of a month, but that was it. I often fantasize about meeting a girl in some ordinary public place, like at a grocery store or coffee shop or something, simulating endless possible conversations in my head ( I do this often for potential conversations of all types), but I know that have to put effort into meeting people.nnIs anyone in a similar situation? Any tips to get the ball rolling? Starting is always the hardest part. I feel like if I can just find a catalyst of some sort I will build some momentum."
5712,"jesuisCermantina","post","I hit rock bottom","Hello, nn21fnnI am beyond embarrassed of myself. Social anxiety has put me in so many embarrassing situations where I just want the ground to swallow me. I came to pursue my studies in a new country and the pressure has became unbearable. I can’t read in class, talk in front of people and I will never dream of doing a presentation ever in my life.nnToday was the first day of class, we were supposed to introduce ourselves since we’re a small group of people, maybe 15 of us. I was  supposed to literally only say one sentence: “hello my name is jesuis, I come from () and I am interested in ()” but I couldn’t. I am beyond disappointed of myself. I devoured 120mg or Propranolol two hours ahead just to be able to say this one small sentence. But I couldn’t. nnI ran to the toilet when I saw that my turn was approaching and I was out of breath, shaking and veryVERY anxious. I calmed myself to not get a panic attack in-front of everyone. I thought I could do it. I smiled to myself in the mirror. I thought I looked pretty today. Woke up extra early to take the meds and did my hair and dressed nicely. I felt confident. I always get a tone of compliments but I’ve always hated myself.  I always felt that I was flawed, that I needed to change myself. When I was a teenager, I sometimes would stop talking to my friends for MONTHS just to “work on myself”. I had to fix my weight, I had to pursue a certain skin scare, I had to get rid of this shadow under my eyes before I meet them again. I am obsessed. nnI came back to class, sit silently. One more person and  my turn comes. Only one sentence. You can do it. You won’t be looked at for long. You have thick hair they won’t see how much red you’ve turned. It’s just literally two seconds. Hold on. But I couldn’t. I panicked. My breath stopped, my body tightened, my palms are sweating. I stood up after only sitting for 5 seconds. I told the professor that I forgot my phone in the toilet knowing for sure that it’s in my back-pocket and she would obviously see it when I’ll head to the door. I didn’t know what she would think of me. I turned and she said “really?”. Yes really. n nI am currently sitting downstairs, I will have to wait 2 more hours before I head back to class to collect my things. I don’t know what am I going to tell her. nnI have failed my semester already twice because of social anxiety and I am repeating it for the third time and paying so much money to be given this third chance. It’s the easiest semester but I can’t attend class because we literally have to always be talking. I always hated talking. nIf I fail this semester once again, I will be kicked out of this country and be back to the third country I used to live in. My brother promised if I ever fail and come back he’ll make me marry someone. If they find out after marriage that I am no longer a virgin I will be disowned, probably beaten and what not. nnI have tried to go to two psychiatrists in this country and they didn’t give me any medication, they say I should pursue therapy. Therapy is expensive and my health insurance doesn’t cover it. Also, if I want to go to a third psychiatrist I should wait for ages for an appointment. They told me medication at my age is not good and is addicting especially for social anxiety. At this point, I would rather be addicted to medication and have a normal life than be an embarrassing failure that I am today. They denied me my right to get help. One psychiatrist offered that me to say at the hospital, on bed whole day, getting injected with shit, paying lots of money that I don’t even have just so she doesn’t prescribe me drugs. nnI have once talked the other semester to my professor about my issue and she told me to quit school and pursue something else. School isn’t for people like me she says. She has never seen someone with this issue before she says. I shouldn’t be in this country at the first place because I had this issue she says. nShe also literally told every other person about my situation and embarrassed me some more even though it’s something personal I confined her with. I thought this country was more developed than my country but I hate them both equally now.nnStill sitting downstairs, it’s freezing. nI don’t know what now. I want to attempt suicide. "

I'm only 19 and I feel like it's stolen my whole life away from me before it even began. I'm far to anxious to go to my doctor about it right now. Is there anything I can do to help myself in the meantime. Have any of you guys got any advice or things I can try. I feel like if I don't make a start now I'll never be able to get it under control, I don't want to let it continue getting worse without at least trying to manage it. nThanks"

I’ve had situational social anxiety for years — I can function normally around people and in public, but when I feel like the “spotlight” is on me or people are paying attention to me, I crumble —  and feel awful. nnIt has held me back from meeting new people, pursuing career goals and hobbies out of fear of rejection or embarrassment. I started therapy a month or two ago and I’m really hoping this is the start of a new beginning for my life. I’m wary of believing in a “magic pill,” but what are some of your experiences with propranolol in regards to social anxiety? Also, I do like to drink and go out — I don’t need the medicine to go out when I am drinking, but is there a danger (like Xanax) in taking the medicine and then hours later drinking? Any advice or tips on this drug appreciation. And looking for experiences and anecdotes of its impact. "
5736,"TomZanetti","post","Social Anxiety: Road to Recovery","Social anxiety is an awful mental health disorder. Having suffered from it since I was 15, I understand how debilitating it can be to just go outside and how the fear before just doing the simplest of tasks can make you feel. nnI am making this post because, although I know this subreddit tends to be mainly memes and jokes, and I love it for that, we do all share one common thing - we all suffer/do suffer from social anxiety. And for many, this post will be useless, but when I first subscribed to this subreddit, I’d never done anything significant to truly address and deal with my mental health. I had a feeling of hopelessness that I no longer have, and if I could go back in time and give these words to myself, I would. If this post can help just one person, then I’ll be happy!nnBut right, in the last year, I met a girl. I struggle with going to University, but I need a future. She made me NEED to get better, and I wish I had the self control to make MYSELF force myself to take steps in getting better. I know for a fact there is someone reading this who hasn’t taken these steps to try and improve their social anxiety, because the social anxiety itself prevents people from doing so. Getting help involves speaking to say, a doctor, or a therapist, and this can be a massive, scary deal.nnSo, with having social anxiety, it can be tremendously difficult to take the first steps to recovery. This is unique, in that suffering from a mental disorder such as OCD or depression doesn’t necessarily restrict you seeking help in the sense of being unable to get yourself, on your own, to see a doctor or a therapist. nnHowever, you have to want to get better. You have to know that you deserve better, that social anxiety is NOT normal, is NOT something anyone should suffer with, and that it IS a strongly researched mental health disorder which is legitimate and known by every health professional. nnYou need to enforce this desire, and you have to make a doctors appointment. This will create a dialogue with your GP. You have to see what support is there for you. Your GP speaks to hundreds of people every week, with a whole host of different issues, both physical and mental. Mental health is a massive public health issue and is finally being treated as such.nnSEE. YOUR. DOCTOR! Doing this was the best thing I ever did, even though I was terrified when I had my first appointment. I am not ashamed to admit that I had some alcohol before going, thought about cancelling in the week leading up to the appointment and was just downright terrified of going. But I did, I said that I had anxiety, in social situations, and guess what - he understood. Doctors. Don’t. Judge.nnI was put on a small dose of medication - was a bit weird for the first few days, as it made me lose my appetite and feel a bit weird, but it settled. You don’t notice the affects of anxiety medication too much, it takes about 6 weeks for it to have any affect. It’s likely you’ll also have your dose increased after your body settles on it. It can feel like a long process, you just want to stop having these feelings of anxiety, of dread, of fear going somewhere and having the physical symptoms of your anxiety presenting themselves and embarrassing you. But it’s just the first step to getting better - medication CAN work. Some say it doesn’t work for them, but it definitely makes some difference for some, and I am living proof of that.nnNext - therapy. I wouldn’t have been able to do a single therapy session if it weren’t for medication. Some will be able to, and if you are, great. Secondly, money. I live in the UK, and here the NHS offer therapy for free if the patient needs it, so I’m lucky in that sense, although the waiting list was 3 months. I am aware that in many countries, therapy isn’t cheap. However, even where money is tight, please realise that your mental state is so important, and is ABSOLUTELY worth spending money on in looking to improve it. Social anxiety is not normal, and is not something you should have to be subject to every day. You deserve to get professional help. For those who literally cannot afford therapy, I sincerely apologise and ask you to see if there is anything you can do to get the help you need.nnTherapy is scary, at first. But it’s also the best thing I’ve forced myself to do. You become familiar and comfortable with a therapist. They understand social anxiety, they put you at ease and remind you that this is their JOB, and that they deal with patients with social anxiety EVERY SINGLE DAY.nnThese are things you can do, that WILL make an improvement to your social anxiety. It will make your quality of life better, and it is absolutely worth doing. You only get one life on this earth, don’t live yours in the shackles of social anxiety because you deserve better.nnSupport is out there!"
5737,"Davidelee128","post","Posted here once few days ago, decided to open up myself. I really need to talk.","I’m a male, 20, Canadian. I’m still in my gap year and pursuing a university level engineering degree. I don’t have friends, not even loved ones. nnI used to be really popular in early high school as I was always happy. I’d never get angry even though my day sucked. I used to play soccer and basketball for the school. Teammates are really supportive and friendly. I enjoyed my time being in the team. Also I loved volunteering and helping people in need such as charity walk, donating blood, food bank,etc.. I also served as a Scout for a really long time. People really liked me and I liked people.nnBut when I was 17, I moved to a big city and continued to complete my high school diploma. That’s where the nightmare began.nnI got in a school that nobody really liked me. Even though I’d been initiating conversation and I just felt like they were avoiding me. It’s completely different to compare with the previous school. Classmates stared at me when I completed a presentation, while they applauded for the others. Nobody willing to talk to me even though we got similar interests. Some kept gossiping about me (And the sad thing is they seemed nice to me). Teachers and the school didn’t really offer much help even though I seek for help. I started to hate going to school and making friends. People aren’t as beautiful as you thought. I feel like I can’t really fully trust anyone anymore. I can’t tell anyone about this because I don’t want anyone to know how broken I am. I literally cried everyday when I got back to home because I don’t want to show people that I’m weak. But the fact is, I’m weak.nnBut fortunately I quit my school few months ago. I got a tutor that can offer me official credits and it’s like a 1 on 1 tuition. I’m working towards to become an engineer. I still don’t have friends but actually it can be a good thing - no gossip and I don’t have see much people so I’ll just pretend people aren’t avoiding me. So that I can focus on my academic and get into a university. I heard that university is way better than high school - better environment, perhaps better people.nnBut to be honest I can’t really trust people anymore. I’m always afraid of meeting new people. At this period of time I still cry sometimes when I feel lonely (it can’t be held, but it usually occurs at home because I just can’t forget how broken I was, wish I can forget everything happened in the school). But secretly, in washroom or bedroom. And I’ll feel way better after crying a bit. Keep working and working so that I can get into university.nnSometimes I really feel like I’m mentally sick. But I DON’T want to be treated as a patient, or a problem. I just want to be treated as a normal individual. I want to have companies. Being loved by somebody is so warming. nnI’m sorry I typed so many. I know this is like some sort of shitpost because some people would think that I haven’t been working hard enough and looking for excuse. Well I’m so sorry about that and I’m working so hard in order to become an engineer recently, I can assure you that I WILL get an engineering degree eventually. But I just want to talk and I feel better after typing this because I’m quite upset in these 2 years. nnDownvotes are expected. At least I feel better.nn"

I usually just say, ""I'm depressed,"" or ""I get anxious."" It just doesn't feel right claiming to have these things that are considered medical conditions. (I don't know if I worded that right). There are so many people struggling worse than I am, and it feels so wrong/inaccurate to even put my issues on any level near theirs. Even when I was having these extremely frustrating moments pretty often, I still don't think it'd be accurate to tell others I have ""anxiety/depression."" I haven't gone to a doctor or therapists for all my issues yet, so I don't self-diagnose myself when people ask. Sorry if a lot of this doesn't make sense.

I'm 16, in high school, and I have been struggling with ADHD and social anxiety for most of my life. I have done and said many impulsive and inappropriate things in the past because of my ADHD, and was viciously bullied and harassed for it. I seem to have control of my actions and words now but I have very much retreated into my shell. Junior Prom is coming up, and I have told my friends I refuse to go because such an event would make me extremely anxious. One of them tried to set me up with a girl and I said no (although I did not like the girl at all tbf).nn&amp;#x200B;nnThe friends I have I get along with fine in school. I would say I'm a fairly funny person as people often laugh at my jokes. In one on one conversations I keep good eye contact, manage the convo well, etc. During lunch with them and some other kids who I don't hang out with, I am almost always very quiet. I used to hang out with some of them a couple times freshman year, but not anymore. I'm not sure why they haven't invited me to things, added me to group chats, etc. I feel like if I open up to one of them about this they would see me as needy.nn&amp;#x200B;nnI am tall + very skinny and fairly ugly - my facial features are well proportioned, but the way my skull (especially my jaw which is quite long and a bit horsefaceish) looks is what makes it ugly. I hate having pictures taken of me because of how ugly I look, which happens repeatedly and has happened often in the past, where people just randomly send other people snapchats of me. This sinking feeling of ugliness makes me feel like I want to wear a paper bag over my head when I get home from school. I feel like I am a husk of the man I should be - in my head I can be strong willed but I know physically I will never be able to back myself up or be man enough to go on dates, protect myself, get respect from others, etc.  Because of my ugliness and weakness as a male, other guys are often extremely condescending and pitying to me and I receive little to no respect from peers - many of whom say very lewd and inappropriate comments to me to try and make me feel awkward. Some girls also do the same thing by giving thinly veiled sarcastic and condescending comments to me. I don't enjoy leaving the house because of how I look and often basic social interactions such as the thought of going to the gym and signing up scare me. nn&amp;#x200B;nnI am optimistic, because I know once college comes if I have been working out I will no longer be skinny and maybe testosterone will make me look less like an ugly 12 yr old girl (srs). I have been compared to 11 from Stranger Things (even with an unbiased look at it I definitely do not look like her. I'm not sure why people say that) which has made me depressed and angry at myself and my androgynous features. I also know that when that time comes I will never see anyone from high school again and nobody will judge me for my past actions. I just wish I could enjoy my next year and a half or so in high school. I would like to have a discussion with one of my friends about never being invited to anything and what happened and about how I feel but I have no clue how I would bring it up in normal conversation at school (which would be quite strange as others would overhear) and I wonder if texting them about it would be weird.nn&amp;#x200B;nnThx for the help in advance"

I was so freaked out about arriving late and dealing with that, that I decided not showing up at all would be better. And this panic came from a whole lot of other anxieties. I’ve been so anxious about whether or not I’m capable of doing any kind of meaningful jobs— I am always terrified that ill singlehandedly ruin a company or be so bad that people regret hiring me, and this job opportunity really brought those feelings out. As well as the panic about the career change.nnSo now I have to figure out what to do for the next two hours, and what to tell my family and our family friend who got me the nomination.

I have never been social, having only a few friends my entire life. I've always had bad social anxiety. A few years ago, my father died. I was a university student at the time and just locked myself in my room, living nocturnally and only operating when everyone else was asleep. I would go months without talking to anyone and ended up failing university and dropping out.nnSo I moved back home with my mother and have lived as a complete shut-in for almost two years. I literally do not leave the house, I will sometimes go in the garden but no further. There is no need. Now I am just incomprehensibly socially anxious. I cannot answer the door to the mailman when he delivers parcels, or even talk to people on the phone. I realised how bad this was and had to ask my mother to book me an appointment at the therapist, which she did. So I prepared to leave the house to go to one session and when we arrived, I could not talk to him. I uttered my name and said hello and then just started crying. I just couldn't think of anything to say. So I just ran outside and back to the car. I'm a 23 year old man. This is pathetic. What do I do, please.? "

This is the only place I feel safe to post this story. nn&amp;#x200B;nnBasically I am 21 years old and a guy.nn&amp;#x200B;nnUntil 10 years old I was a bit shy and introverted, but otherwise totally normal and with good social skills. Had a nice group of small friends. We did all the usual stuff. nnAfter becoming very popular for a short time, some people spread false rumours about me at 11 years old to keep a popular girl from talking to me, and 80% of students either ditched me or began bullying me as a result. nnBeing a little boy with now no friends and a 'broken heart' (that's what it felt like at 11), I began acting out in class (arriving late, talking back to the teacher) which lead to even more bullying and having the headteacher shame me in front of the WHOLE class (60 people)nn&amp;#x200B;nnThis caused me to develop an extreme case of Social Anxiety which even after moving schools (thankfully people there were much nicer) I could not overcome. Basically at 12, I was so traumatized I told myself to avoid other teens for the rest of my life. nn&amp;#x200B;nnAt 14, under a very rushed diagnosis (2 hours of questions and then literally observing me sitting alone at lunch) with 90 minutes of sleep  the school physchologist gave me what was then called Asperger diagnosis.nn&amp;#x200B;nnThe school physchologist NEVER asked if I was shy, felt like low self esteem or felt anxious around people.nn&amp;#x200B;nnThe special needs teachers that I was then paired with, told me that I literally (apart from being anxious about people rejecting me, and horribly insecure) didn't show a single sign of even PPD-NOS.nn I also could not relate to any other people with a similar high-functioning diagnosis and seemed to be a world away from them, although they were very nice and friendly :)nn&amp;#x200B;nnAt 16, I managed to slightly overcome my shyness and made normal group of close friends, again doing all the regular teenage stuff (parties, hanging out, sports, shopping, talking about girls, many emotional conversations about feelings).nn&amp;#x200B;nnSince that day, I have been to multiple doctors and done multiple tests. All say the same: I don't even fall close to the boundaries of having Autism. nnYet I am still stuck with extreme self-doubt and massive inferiority complex as well as unbearable Social Anxiety from the events at 11 years old and especially the later misdiagnosis. I feel like I cannot trust that I am NT, despite it being completely obvious and *every* doctor and test saying so. nnAlso all the therapists I saw for Social Anxiety, in which I spoke about my life in intimate detail told me I don't show any signs of Autism spectrum.nn&amp;#x200B;nn&amp;#x200B;nn***Has anyone gone through this and how can I overcome the MASSIVE self-doubt and crushed self-esteem from both events in my life?***nn&amp;#x200B;nn&amp;#x200B;"

The introduction section in the auditorium ended and we went into the lab for lab training. We had to wear these white suits from head to toe. We all looked like the Michelin man. There was no way to tell who was who. In the lab I bumped arms with someone reaching for the scales and said ""oops sorry"", then a female voice said ""no worries there is way to little space in here"". We started talking about how confusing everything was and how we didn't know what we were doing. It was so natural. I was just talking to a white suit. We kept talking and when the lab session ended we went to take the suits off and it was her. She had the brightest smile on her face and we just kept talking like it was nothing. We ended up dating that entire summer. It was amazing, and it never would've happened if it weren't for those suits. It's amazing how social discourse changes when we remove the variable of looks. Don't fret about how someone looks. Just talk to them as a person. I used subconsciously keep thinking ""she's so hot she's so hot"", but now when I'm talking to a really hot girl I just picture her as the Michelin man.  "

The reason why I got a job it’s because I’m really trying to get out of my comfort zone. You see I struggle with walking into a store. I get so nervous especially when it’s crowded inside. I can’t go out to eat at restaurants or go to main event. The gym I wait until midnight to go, because it’s empty. When I do go out with my friends that are outgoing and loud. I always get ask by them, are you okay ? Or by random strangers if I’m okay? Because I look like I’m not having fun. I struggle with expressing myself. If something is funny I try not to laugh.  Because I’m not comfortable to do so. My facial expressions are always blank ones.  nnI can’t even talk to a therapist because I get extremely uncomfortable and nervous.  nnIt just sucks that I’m still not out of my shell. I hate being lonely. I want a partner to share a life with but I’m too scared to date. nnI got this dating app, when I text on there I have a completely different personality. It’s more like confident, funny, outgoing. But as soon as we set a date I come up with an excuse. That I can’t make it. And I’ll never message that person again. nnI also suffer with an addiction that I am embarrassed to say but I will say it. It’s porn. I’m addicted to porn, it’s been 6 years now I’ve been battling with this addiction. nnI use the gym to get away from my negative or insecurity thoughts.  It’s where I feel safe and strong in. nnFor 6 months I suffer from suicidal thoughts and depression.  Now that has gone away on its own.  Im starting to feel depressed again though. nnI just don’t know why I’m like this, what is wrong with me?  I know this builds character once you overcome it. And that’s what I want. I want to overcome everything I’ve been suffering with for years now.  Thanks for reading !nn"

But I know a piece of paper isn't a true acheivement. I wanted to start bachelors classes but I'm completely unmotivated because I feel I'll be terrible in whatever field I chase. Having a career isn't the only worry I have, this just adds to the weight I carry from being so lonely.nnI really struggle with self-perception. I HATE how I look and am positive it's been a factor as to why people don't seem to like me. I work a job where people talk to each other but never me. People constantly have friends and girlfriends and hookups, yet these are the same people who treat others like shit, including me. I don't understand why I get treated so badly and isolated from the rest. I recently went to a trip with some managers, and I felt like I didn't fit in AT ALL. I'm so quiet wherever I'm at, meanwhile other people get approached with ease. I was made to feel weird.nnI don't even have a friend to talk to. Everyone has people texting them on phone or snapchat. People in real life hate me so the Internet is the only platform I have to turn to. I try my hardest to get some real answers as to why I'm so lonely but I barely get any responses.nnWhy is it that I don't deserve anyone to talk to? Why is it that others can do as they please yet me being quiet and keeping to myself get the most hate from others? It's SO FUCKING hard to deal with feeling like this. Why is that so inconceivable?nnHas anyone here found any degree of success with finding someone? There's no point in being alive if you're friendless. I just work, eat, and sleep. Up until recently I was doing my best to go to the gym. But the lack of friendship and the way people are around me ruined my motivation. I don't have friends. Co workers don't like me. I've still never had sex. I've realized that people love to walk over shy, quiet people like me. Everyone in this sub is hated by the rest of society. I don't think anything can change, at least not for me. I'm almost 23 and socially dysfunctional. And I don't want to try anymore. Everyone preemptively has something against me."

5769,"SoCloseToGraduation","post","I need advice on how to temporary cope with my social anxiety so I can finally graduate college.","Alright so here's my situation:nI'm currently a 23 year old university student. I'm currently a senior and only need roughly 9 more classes to graduate. My plan is to graduate next year, during the spring. I originally attended community college for 2 years and transferred to my local university where I've been currently enrolled for 4 years. This next year will be my 5th year. So in total, I've been enrolled at school for about 7 years trying to getting my bachelors degree. nnnThe problem:nI have really bad social anxiety. Ever since I was a kid, I've struggled with it. As a result, I don't have much friends, I find it hard to socialize with people, and I'm pretty awkward. Because of this, I've been putting off/failed/dropped most classes that involve doing presentations or any 'social' related assignments/projects. As a result, I have about a total of 7 F's in my transcript and will probably get another 3 more after this semester is over. Although I calculated that I might still avoid being on academic suspension if I get at least an A and C or B and B for the 2 remaining classes I'm enrolled this semester. Overall I'm just tired of this shit I've put myself into.nn7 classes that I need are group/presentation based. I'm taking 2 presentation/group biased classes this summer. One of them is a speech class which obviously requires me to talk in front of others in order to pass. The other is a group/presentation based class. I've took this speech class twice, dropped it the first time and failed the second time, and the other class once (failed it). At this point, if I can't pass these 2 classes during the summer, I'd rather just dropout out completely since I'll end up in academic suspension. nnSo yeah, overall I need some sort of advice/help. I'm planning to drink a bit of alcohol to ease my nerves for the presentation. I'm not sure if that's a good idea since I've never tried it. Illegal drugs isn't an option since I don't want to get caught and go to jail or end up expelled. nnGoing to a therapist or something like that isn't an option since I can't afford it at this moment and I'm not sure what my parents will think about this. They don't 'approve' mental health. nnAny advice/tips will be appreciated. I'm also willing to provide more info about myself/situation since I'm not sure what else to add.nnThanks."

5772,"GGffat20","post","Do I have anxiety? Adhd? Something else?","Hi guys,nnI’m 22 years old and confused regarding my mental state. To start I have always struggled paying close attention to professors during lectures consistently zoning out. Second, when I study, it takes me so long just to get one section done with the amount of distractions that occur. On top of that, I have a tough time concentrating on what friends or people say when I have a conversation thus resulting in making it tough for me to build connections. This problem could be from something else tho, like social anxiety since that occurs too sometimes when I’m at parties. Even at the gym, sometimes I can’t concentrate enough on lifting but more the people around me and what they’re doing. A few months ago, a friend gave me some addy and I’ve taken vyvanse recently as well to study and I’ve noticed startling differences. Firstly, I can actually get work done, and don’t put things off. Second, my anxiety completely disappears and I start conversations and even hit up old friends through text. I actually feel confidence too. I can talk to people and not worry about what I’m saying and actually speak my thoughts. I actually allow myself to become vulnerable. My question is, should I get prescribed? Is it worth it? Is there a bigger underlying problem that exists? I’m graduating in 2 months and will be working soon and I’m thinking about therapy as well. I just want to know what’s wrong with me and why my life feels great on medication but not when I’m not on it. "

I try to eat as healthy as possible. This includes taking Super greens recently to make sure I'm getting plenty of good vitamins. All of this came on very suddenly about a year ago and the symptoms seems to come and go as they please.

I've tried on other subreddits, but didnt get as many responses, but I hope I get some suggestions from this one.nnSo I am a 17 male in year 12 who thinks that my life is a failure. Since i was in year 7 i was bullied because of things which i couldn't fix, such as my voice, my ugly head, and my name. when i get introduced to younger people in my school they even think that I am autistic because of the way i talk and look. When year 9 came, it started to be daily, and it was so bad that i just gave up and just accepted the fact that I was a failure. I mean, i thought there was literally nothing i could do. My marks from assignments and exams fell from 80s to 60s, and then to 50s and sometimes even to 40s and 30s. I feel like those fucking assholes (10-20 people) in my school took 6 years away from my life.nnNot everyone was mean to me, but i could see from pretty much everyone's facial expression that they either doesn't like me, doesn't want to be with me because they don't want to be in a group with someone who gets bullied by other people. People were only my 'friends', because they felt sorry for me but in reality, every single one of them hated me, and i could see it. I was always left out in groups, always the last person to do things, always the last person to be picked in sport. Sometimes I pretended that I would 'hang out' with people and tell my mum that I was going out with friends, but I just went to some place by myself. Because of those fucking bullied, I never got to experience things like 'normal' people do, such as hanging out with friends, going to parties, going to each others houses, playing games, watching movies together, all that stuff. While other people were doing those things, I was alone, in my room, being a loner, just playing video games and watching TV. I never wanted this, but those fucking people turned my life into shit. Sure i could talk to my principle and make him expel all those people, but i was scared that he might make some kind of announcement talking about it and everyone would look at me. Even if i did do it somehow, it wouldn't change anything about me. Maybe the bullying will stop, at least for a while, but i will still be the same ugly shit.nnBeing bullied for 6 years changed me. Before I started high school in year 7 I was actually a pretty talkative guy, I had friends who actually liked me being around them, and actually liked talking to me. But everything changed when they found out about these things. The friends that i had before all turned on me and they became friends with the people who i hated the most. I have social anxiety every time I go outside, and I cant talk to girls for shit, god, i don't think I've had an actual conversation to a girl around my age since i was 10. I feel like I've missed out so much over these last 6 years but i couldn't do those things because of my social anxiety and bullying. I feel so fucking behind everyone else and i don't know what I'm supposed to do to improve myself. So many of the guys in my grade have a job, have female friends, and many of them even have girlfriends, but i have none of that. For the past year and a half everyday I have been playing the same goddamn movie in my head of what i could have been, if i wasn't ugly, didn't have anxiety or wasn't this fat. I could have done so much more. I just wish that i could have time traveled to my 10 year old body, but with my 17 year old soul. I could have changed so much. I've been thinking of going to therapy or speech therapy for a few weeks now, but I've been holding back ever since, because I'm scared and have social anxiety to even go there. Yes i know it could be the best decision that i make to start improving myself but because of my anxiety i haven'e been able to go.nnHopefully after writing this i can improve my life, thanks guys"

Other people (on the outside) however are becoming aware of that, and have started calling out a lot of people for misusing the term, using it to gain sympathy or using it to compensate for basic insecurities.nnI was officially diagnosed with SAD when I was 15, but have had it since I was a child. In more recent years in light of a lot of failures in my life, I've started struggling with the thought that I might not have SAD, but am just a scared and lazy human being who can't get on with life and work hard like everyone else. I started to think that because like I said before, it seems like anyone can say they have anxiety these days. A multimillionaire can say he has it and people might believe him, people might not believe him... and I'm pretty sure I would be put against those same odds. 'I' being: a broke, jobless, friendless and hopeless 20 year old.nnOn the other hand however, even when I accept I have anxiety, I'm ashamed to tell anyone because I just want to be normal.

I want to go to my doctor about it because it extremely affects my sleep but I can’t find the strength to do it. Talking to people is the most anxiety provoking event for me. When I walk outside, I think people are starring at me or talking about me. I’m always afraid to say the wrong thing. I’m subleasing an apartment for the summer and if I hear that my roommate is out of her room, I won’t even leave mine until I for sure know she is back in hers. It’s becoming a problem because I’ll get really hungry or have to go to the bathroom and I’ll stand with my door on the handle until she goes in her room or leaves. I’ll be in my room for hours at a time. I’ve been here for a week and have talked to her twice. The one thing that helps me is listening to music with my headphones in. It really calms me down but I find myself in situations where it is rude to do so. I have spent the past year avoiding most social situations that now, I am in a position where I am in continuos contact with people and have to speak to them but I can barely put a sentence together. I never know what to say and it just makes me feel really awkward no matter the simplicity of the conversation. If I don’t know how to do something, I’m too afraid to even ask a question about it. I don’t want to mess up anything because it will make me anxious about having to do it again and it’s just a continuos cycle.

I always had a deviated nasal septum, so a doctor told me I could use some nasal drops, containing dexamethasone, which is a corticosteroid. The long usage of corticosteroid stunted my growth for three years, it's a common effect. It's called Cushing's Syndrome. I'm 5'5(165cm) and probably would be 5'10 without taking the medication. Also a study confirmed that genital development is also affected. I have a little bit more than a 5.5 inches penis, and very thin, about 4.5 inches in girth. I think about this all the time. I like tall girls, and being shorter makes it harder to get them, and even some shorter girls have this height requirement. How do I accept this? That I will not have the same life as I was naturally meant to be. A girl might not find me as attractive as she would, if i had a larger penis and was taller. This medication fucked my life. I don't want to whine, but this has been deeply affecting my life. And i'm also very shy, so these two more complexes are making my head explode. I need help.

I've been reading a lot of posts on this forum lately and it has made me realize how emotional and fragile creatures human beings really are. We take our well being so much for granted. Let's take a moment to be grateful for how far we have come in our lives.nnLike many others on this subreddit, I've too been facing issues with anxiety and self confidence lately and thought to share my story. It's a long one but I'm sure that some of you will resonate with it. I'm posting this for you and my future self.nnI'm 22M. Was raised in a middle class family in a small town in Asia. My dad, the sole earner of the family, left his city job when I was born to take care of my elderly grandparents. Money was scarce since childhood. Witnessed my dad going through several failed businesses, alcoholism, deteriorating health and relationships, and more. Meanwhile, mom stayed at home, taking care of us. nnBy God's grace and through witnessing my family's struggles, I turned out to be a fairly bright student, stayed top of my class throughout school. Not only in academics but also extra curriculars. I was (am?) a jewel  of my school. So good so far, but things had already started to take a turn towards the end of school. I noticed that I didn't have many friends. It didn't bother me then. While my classmates enjoyed life, fooling around and getting out there in the world, I had opted for a different path.nnI chose to devote myself to studies in order to enter the best colleges in the country. And oh boy is that tough. I studied insane amount of hours a day, avoiding all social contact for some X years. Just locked up in my room and working hard. Well, I managed to get into the best college, but something had already changed in these years. At that moment, I wasn't really sure what. Turns out, the word is personality.nnThe college fell below my expectations. The people felt different. Most of them came here to enjoy the fruits of their labor, while I was hungry for more. While people enjoyed their lives, I was out there, working towards a bigger goal. Health took a toll for the first time during the first year. Developed some weird infection and had to go through minor surgery. Didn't end up making many friendships that year. Well that's no big deal, but except that it was. I noticed that I am not very good in social situations. Something me as a school kid was not.nnThe incidents made me look inwards, perhaps there was a flaw with myself. Self confidence took a toll. It became difficult to convey my thoughts. The next year at college didn't go very smooth either. Got bullied by some toxic seniors. It severely damaged my already limited self confidence. I became convinced that I am somewhat socially awkward.nnThings improved a bit the next year. Had managed to build some friends. Everything was going smoothly and then the pandemic happened. Left for home. Studies again took control. After all, college would be ending soon. I wanted to go abroad for higher studies, so I had to work hard. nnFell back to my earlier routine of studying - locked up in a room and working day and night. Seasons changed as I sat in my room in front of the computer. Submitted my college applications, waited for the results, and got into a really good college. I had earned my place. However, I had also earned something else. Something big in the making all these years. nnThe next few months flew by. And then came  the day of May 28, 2021. As I was brushing my teeth at midnight, I felt a sudden choking. Woke up my parents and rushed to the hospital. All results turned out to be normal and the doctor said I was just worried. What?! It was a panic attack. Oh, I thought what's that. Let's not panic then. Turns out that's not how this game works. It happened again the next night and then again the next.nnWe soon left town for a bigger city and a better hospital hoping to have an easier solution. The doctors said the same thing. Its something you have to control and live with. So much of modern science and they can't cure this, I laughed in my head. That's how life is folks. You got to live with it.nnMonths have passed since and I'm still living with it. Changing continents does not help it seems. Jokes apart, making friends has become even harder for a now reserved and introverted person like me. I have trouble talking even to strangers at the payment counter. Walking alone gives me the shivers (nice song Ed ;). Love life is at a whole different level. I am now at a 7 year streak of not having casually talked with a girl (since high school). No rain predicted in this desert at least in the foreseeable future. nnNevertheless, I'm much more aware of my condition now. It seems like an arduous journey ahead but I'm prepared for it. After all, I'm a fighter. I'm the white tiger.nnSo that, folks, is my story. Thank you for making it so far. I would love to hear some of your thoughts, stories or tips regarding anything in my story that resonated with you. nnTake care of yourselves and your loved ones. Wishing you all a great 2022 ahead!"

I actually enjoy talking to the people there. I’m the least anxious there. However, today I was told that the clinician is already finding mistakes in the work of the person I’m training. I wasn’t told this directly so I kind of feel like I’m being set up to fail. It sucks because it kind of killed my vibe of going there and enjoying being around people."
5924,"GoHuskies858","post","Social anxiety holding me back in both personal and professional life","Hi everyone, this may be a bit long, but I appreciate anyone who reads even most of this!nn&amp;#x200B;nnAnyway, I'm a 24 M living in a big city. And a social anxiety sufferer. My social anxiety isn't physically crippling or physiological -- my physical symptoms are usually pretty limited -- but it's mental and I am an expert in avoidance. I would even say I am a \*very\* social and outgoing person in ""comfortable"" environments (alcohol, bars, sporting events, with friends or people I trust, etc.), but when it comes to ""uncomfortable"" environments including putting myself out there and being alone doing it, I avoid them (joining clubs/sports teams, going to events, meeting new people, talking to people at bars, etc.)  altogether.nn&amp;#x200B;nnMy social anxiety stems from insecurity and a lack of self-confidence. I wasn't beat up or anything as a kid, but I grew up being bullied, condescended toward, and made fun of for my lack of height at the time -- I was one of the shortest kids in school (I'm 5'8 now and have not been insecure about this in years) -- and for being skinny and small in general as a man in a society that often sees men like that as weak and a joke. Teachers told me I couldn't audition for roles because of my height, kids my age made fun of me, and adults made snide comments. All of this contributed toward deeply ingraining into my head a fundamental insecurity. I wore sweatshirts during the summer and shirts at the beach because I had terrible body image issues. From the age of like 10. **Long story short, from an early age I was very insecure, had major body image issues, and terrible self-confidence and this contributed greatly to creating my social anxiety.**nn&amp;#x200B;nn**Fast forward to today.** I am still skinny and small and find that the women who are into me tend to be 2-3 years younger usually because I \*do\* look young and small for my age.  Dating can be frustrating. But, I am going to the gym, I'm starting to feel more confident in my body, and I know that I have had a good amount of romantic opportunities, even if it has never worked out into a relationship. I feel good about myself, have become extremely self-aware of my own insecurities and how I projected them in the past, and in general I am content. But, I still cannot get over the avoidance of social anxiety. It's ingrained into my head.nn&amp;#x200B;nn**It has prevented me from making more friends** in a new city -- the idea of doing a Meetup or joining a club is terrifying to me. And I just avoid doing that kind of thing altogether. **It has prevented me from, say, talking to women at a bar,** \*even in\* a drunken state when I feel good about myself. It just takes over and I tell myself I'm not attractive, that I'm going to embarrass myself, etc. It has essentially reduced my chances of meeting women to only on dating apps. **And it also has held me back in my career and what I want to do in life**. I'm a deeply political person but I can't network. I can't bring myself to go to happy hour's by myself or join political clubs or anything. I simply cannot put myself out there alone into unfamiliar situations. The thought of being awkward or having no one to talk to or being seen as ridiculous or an idiot -- these things fill my head and so avoid these situations altogether.nn&amp;#x200B;nnI don't want to look back five years from now and not have made more friends, not have taken a risk romantically by talking to someone I didn't know, and not have truly tried to pursue my political dreams. I have gone to therapy lately but the appointments are few and far in-between (once a month at best) and while it has helped me become even more self-aware, it has not helped me with, well, changing my brain chemistry. And I don't want to be resigned to thinking this is just how I am going to be. I am missing out on so many opportunities from friends to partners to career/hobbies. **Above all, I am frustrated that I have all the logical solutions to this problem (Who actually cares what people think of you?), but that does nothing for what feels like an innate reaction to unfamiliar situations**. **I can be confident one moment and then crumble the next. I get rejected in some form and it just feeds into a spiral.** **This is very long and I am rambling, but thought I would find friendly ears here. Maybe people in my shoes who have suggestions and have conquered (or struggle with) the same things I have. Feels nice to not be alone.**"

This new year I was hit with this horrible feeling(despite the fact that I'm going to therapy and I'm trying to talk to people). It's hard being friendless and with social anxiety, also being sensitive and feeling like everyone rejects you all the time. There's no one to say they're proud of me or to make effort to talk to me and care for me, I only have myself. No support from family, no friends. There's only people I talk to sometimes but feel no connection to. It's really difficult like this. My only wish for my entire life was to make just one or two close friends, and that it would be a result of my hard work and not pure luck as it usually is. I want to make a friend on my own without relaying on luck and looking through people, giving up on them quickly and moving on to the next person, until I find someone randomly. I want to make a friend by being my true self, but it'll take a while until I get there. I'm going to try and be patient with myself this year, allow myself to vent out my frustrations and baggage in safe places, change my mindset and take risks in a better way, and let go of my past. Most importantly, I'll allow myself to not be perfect. I'm already excited to try and take these risks, it feels like a fun thing to look forward to. Trying out any new thing related to my social life is kind of exciting to think about. Currently I'm just feeling really lonely, and I wanted to share my thoughts. As I am not having a great time right now, I just wanna say that I empathize with a lot of you and I wish the best for all of us."

My mom was super strict, kinda abusive, paranoid and really overprotective especially because she is a military veteran (Marine) and I'm the only girl out of the family (2 brothers) so she was especially strict and overprotective of me also bc of my ""dad"" (dead to me thats all I'll say) and would not let any men or boys near me and kept me sheltered in a way like I already had no real friends during my school years but she still would not let me sleep over, go to parties or stay out late etc. In a way I do see where she came from because of the mistreatment, heartbreak and shady things my ""dad"" did to her and she doesn't want me to go through the same thing so I started seeing through her eyes, now I'm overprotective, strict, sheltered and have super low trust issues like you could smile and say hi to me but I'd still be skeptical of you. That's kinda why I always felt like a loser, outcast (I mean I was the quiet kid, everyone was afraid to talk to, according to my brother who they all told) because everyone in my grade had groups of friends and went places, traveled, had late night parties but I stayed at home and played video games bc I was never allowed to go out *in my mom's words* ""because I'm a girl"" and honestly now that I'm living alone and try and go out sometimes at stores to run errands I can kinda see what she's saying bc I do get men that stare at me (and I've had some follow me around the store sometimes) I had a man full on touch my butt at hollywood studios waiting in line at the icee cart but I didnt do or say anything bc I don't like confrontation and I'm too weak but I just turned my head and it was just so obvious it was him bc he was standing right behind me and my family was all waiting at the back for me not looking. nnSorry didnt mean to get lost in story time but yea I think this is the main reason I have social anxiety and don't like being around people, my mom just always told me about how evil this world is and how people are and even though she always told me I was beautiful and I looked just like her, she didnt want me to be involved with any man bc it scares her, just knowing how I am but she's only like that bc of her divorce and her relationship with men. nnI will admit I am naive, way too nice, gullible and easy to manipulate and its happened a few times and killed my self esteem so thats why I'm afriad to get to know people."

I went to a psychologist because I can't get over it alone.nnTo some extent, I managed to live my life normally, but it got worse.

5936,"_temp_variable","post","I find a problem with every community I could become a part of","I'm 21 and this is something I struggle with a lot. nnIt feels like most communities I have tried to be a part of have features around them that made me distance myself from being a part of that community. I understand that I am the problem in this situation and I'm probably overgeneralizing everything.nnHere are some examples:nnI enjoy casual gaming, but not enough to care about gaming news or events. I feel like a huge amount of people in the gaming community my age are overly edgy, rage a lot over games or are neckbeardy which scares me off. I also hate playing video games for hours on end, I get burnt out really easily and gamers usually like to have long sessions with each other. I drifted away from my gaming friends because the burnout from playing video games for hours at a time was too much for me.nnI enjoy hip hop and r&amp;b, but a lot of the culture around this for my age is associated with people who smoke weed, drink, and go clubbing, which intimidates me as I don't like the loss of control associated with drugs and loud 'carefree' environments like clubs. I also feel like there's huge pressure to be on social media within this community. In high school I was friends with people who were into this community a lot and as they got older we drifted apart as they became clubbers and big on alcohol etc.nnI enjoy football, but I hate the competitiveness that comes with playing it (even socially, you'll get shouted at or made fun of for mistakes) and there is a hyper masculine/ drinking community stereotype associated with casual footballers my age. I also am terrible at football! I have always dabbled in and out of this community but as I was never very good, I didn't really get any respect, and I found playing a very high pressure scenario.nnAll the above seem like immaturity problems, but there are other communities Ive tried to get into that I didn't have this problem with but I just didn't enjoy being a part of them. nnFor example I have tried an art community, but I am not very good at art which made me embarassed whenever I went to the classes, and the way I think I naturally struggled to make and critique art. I also just felt very uncomfortable in this environment, which I think may be due to the fact that I'm not very passionate about art. I'm happy I at least tried though.nnI have tried a board game community, but I found it too nerdy for me, and I just didn't find any of the board games we played fun. I just didn't feel engaged enough and as passionate as the others were about the games, and the people in the group were all a lot older than me.nnI'm constantly looking for communities I can join which I will feel comfortable with. I am thinking maybe a running community.  However I am worried that this problem is going to follow me everywhere since I seem to perfectionistic about who I be friends with. Like I already know I don't care about run times and stuff so I may feel out of place being surrounded by people who do care.nnIf anyone else has dealt with this, it would be great to hear some advice. Thanks!"

Especially with people that I am not familiar with. I always think of something quick to say so the conversation continue fluidly . But there is no continuity or pleasure in this, I remember back then I used to had conversations where at the end the subject was way different from the initial one because there was a development of ideas in the conversation. Now its just quick answers or statements . Its less worse with my girlfriend or my close friends but still I feel like I always have to struggle to search for my words or to talk.

I've recently turned 16 and am reaching the end of my highschool. I've had my social phobia diagnosed for almost 5 years now. This illness has been, and always is, an incredible obstacle in my daily life, from school and important meetings to trifling matters such as online gaming voice-chats. Since then, I've went through countless appointments and therapies in order to eventually overcome it. My family and I have tried plenty of psychological solutions (gradual exposure, challenges, group therapy, hypnosis etc.) before ending up trying medication, as all none of them truly or even barely helped. As of now, things have been better since I started taking antidepressants. Though, as all of you probably know, they're no magic, and I still can't quite cope with social interactions. They simply make them somewhat more manageable. nnHowever, there is one thing that has, and is still making my social life incredibly difficult : Doubt. Social anxiety is so big, it's range of effect so large and it's impacts so massive, that nearly *every single person* I know who are aware of this illness of mine just can't help but doubt of it's authenticity. I've lost very close friends that I've known for years, because they thought I was just making stuff up for attention, or because they eventually grew frustrated of those ""limits"" of mine. I've been called names, insulted and been made fun of by the very people I once considered as friends. All of this because of one, fucking, stupid-ass mental illness.nnFortunately, some of them did trust me and are still by my side. I don't think I would've made it if it weren't for their support. nnI've grown past all of this. But such things are very likely to reoccur, and this is the entire point of this post: *Is there any way to prove that all of this is nothing but the truth? A way for someone to actually believe and be willing to understand those mental limitations i have?*nnI'm open to literally anything at this point. I don't want to lose anymore people because of some bullshit i never asked for, and am looking forward to reading the replies."

It has got worse and worse each time I have to go somewhere and I tried even telling it to my best friend. That helped for a little bit of time but it's the same now. So I wanted to go talk about it to my doctor when I am 18 so finally my question is : Can she tell my parents about my visit because I will have the same doctor for one more year. I know that my parents won't understand so I don't want them to know yet.  I searched for answer a little bit but I wanted to make sure. Or is it better to just try to call some therapist and ask them? Sorry for my English it's not my first language."

I know that my life lacks meaning because I don't take the initiative to interact with anyone and purposefully avoid activities that involve other people. All of my hobbies are solitary or I try to make them solitary, and I many times purposely reject socialisation.nn* Autism spectrum + anxiety makes it very hard for me to form friendships and interact with people in the first place. People can see that I act weird so a lot of them are put off or just not mindful at all.n* I tend to ruminate a lot over any social interactions that I do have, worrying over if I seemed weird or rude. I also get paranoid that my existing friends are going to leave me.....which they always do it seems.n* Because of my crappy childhood I tend to project all of my emotional needs on anyone who shows me kindness. I know its irrational and wrong but in the back of my primitive mind I project the roles of therapist, parent, best friend and lover onto anyone who shows me kindness and understanding.n* I get too attached to everyone. People I'm close to, people I'm around but never said a word to, horrible people, the good the bad and the ugly.n* I'm in a lot of pain over past abandonments and issues with friends. I've been ghosted by close friends for no discernable reason. The more I socialise the more the pain accumulates and it never heals or stops.nnAll these points mean that communicating with anyone, even sometimes just sending an email/text or interacting with the cashier at the supermarket mentally exhausts me. nnI know I'm capable of a so called 'normal' life because I've done it before. For 7 months I had a very 'normal' social life for someone my age. I went out with someone every weekend, I went on a sort of date, I went clubbing and got competent in the bar scene.nnBut it all ended in a lot of hurt and pain. I don't want to socialise if it's only going to end in pain. And the pain doesn't go away, it just keeps building up with every person I get attached to that leaves.nnA lot of people tell me that's just how life is, that it's normal for friendships to last less than 5 years as an adult because people are always moving and want to experience more people in the world. But it's very painful and exhaustive for me. nnSo now I've been alone for the past 2 months. I do a good job of taking care of my physical health and I'm trying to focus on that and hobbies. But I have a bit of medical issues that have no discernable origin and stuff. And my parents insist that not socialising is making me physically and mentally sick.nnBut at least I'm not in pain. There's no people in my life currently except for family, and that means much less pain. I know that people provide meaning and make the world go round, but they also cause me a lot of pain.nnI'm in my final year of university and very burned out, I really can't afford more distractions."

I’m 24 and have never had a real job. I did some lawn care for a local business over the summer a few years ago, but I’m not sure if that really counts for anything. I also live with my parents and have never been to college. At all. I just had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and didn’t want to go into debt to confirm it. Might’ve also had something to do with my being an awful student in middle and high school.nnI wanted to get a job once I was old enough, but my family only had one car (which my dad needed) and we didn't live within walking distance of any businesses. We finally got two good cars a couple years ago, but by that point I knew employers would want to know why I had no experience at my age and was afraid that only fast-food restaurants would consider hiring me. I would rather do almost anything than that.nnAnyway, due to circumstances, I need to find a job before the end of the month. I found a few that might work, but the only one I really kind of want is a retail position at a hardware store. Unfortunately, the qualifications include strong interpersonal skills and strong communication skills. Not sure how my communication skills are. My interpersonal skills are definitely mediocre at best right now. While I'm hopeful that those would improve with practice, I’m not sure if they would give me a chance to find out.nnThe only thing really going for me here is that my dad knows one of the employees and the manager. He stopped in with me a few days ago to ask the employee about a job, and he (employee) said that I should submit an application before Monday and come back *with my dad* next week to talk to the manager without an appointment. That’s really what I’m the most anxious about. This isn’t a formal interview. I have no idea how to prepare. Even though there's a position listed on their site, I suspect they may not actually be hiring right now. Even if they were, why would they want me over some outgoing 17-year-old^(1)? It’s just an entry-level job, but I *want* to work there. Still putting off actually applying. This is all just so overwhelming. I feel like a 24-year-old child.nnI don’t know what the point of this is. I guess I just wanted to say it. Any advice would be appreciated, of course.nn&amp;#x200B;nn^(1) no offence to 17-year-olds"
5991,"yikesamillion32","post","Is it possible to reform a healthy relationship with alcohol?","Let me preface by saying I (23F) have been suffering from varying degrees of social anxiety since my freshman year of high school.  Despite not displaying any symptoms in middle school, I started to notice myself becoming uncomfortable in classroom settings especially with men (maintaining eye contact with teachers, speaking to coaches, approaching authority figures in conversation) in the ninth grade.  While I was able to rationalize that what I was experiencing wasn't normal, I was still able to participate in class discussions, give presentations with minimal nerves, and engage my peers in conversations which is why I didn't think too much of it.  However, the older I got and the more I became aware of my reactions to these situations the worse my symptoms got.  It got to the point where I would wake up anxious and panicking about school in the morning, I would worry about presentations for weeks in advance, could not approach male teachers without making a fool out of myself by shaking and turning red.  nnThis is where the alcohol comes in.  I drank for the first time when I was 16 when my anxiety was reaching (what I thought was) its peak.  I had a great time with my friends and finally understood what all the ""hype"" surrounding social drinking was.  I continued to drink during that summer with only positive experiences.  Yes I was drinking underage but I wasn't participating in any ""risky"" behavior.  I was a happy, laughing drunk who was fun to be around.  When I entered my senior year of high school, I noticed that my relationship with alcohol started to change (or rather I changed the nature of the relationship).  While I had previously used it only in social settings, I found myself realizing that I could use the positive effects that alcohol had had on my personality to help myself through stressful social interactions in school.  nnAs time went on I started to depend on alcohol more and more to get me through these stressful situations.  It got to the point that I started going to school with a water bottle full of vodka and a bottle of soda in my backpack so I could make a drink if I was worried that I would find myself in a public speaking or discussion role that would send me into a panic.  But, I did not think that it was an issue (at the time) because it did not effect my social drinking.  I was still able to be the fun and laughing girl on the weekends while having a little ""help"" during the week.  nnWhen I got into college my dependency on alcohol only became greater.  The thought of having to do ice breakers on the first day of class was enough to make me email my professors that I was sick and wouldn't be able to make it to class.  I even dropped a philosophy class because the reviews of the professor online said that her grading was heavily based on class participation and public speaking.  My dependency on drinking became so bad that I was regularly getting drunk in the morning (9 am) to make it through my classes.  It was almost like I did not care if people knew that I was drinking because feeling comfortable in that setting meant more to me than a classmate realizing that I was drunk.  But I still did not see the magnitude of this problem because I was maintaining a high GPA and was still the happy drunk on the weekends. nnGetting to the point: Now that I am post-grad I've noticed that my relationship with social drinking has changed. While I still occasionally drink to calm my anxiety it is very rare that I have a positive social/weekend experience with alcohol.  I find myself saying hurtful and inappropriate things to the people I am out with and/or the people around us.  I also find that a lot of the time I am an angry drunk that often ends the night crying and wakes up even more anxious than I started; often having to apologize to the people I went out drinking with.  I am completely aware of the fact that I do not have a healthy relationship with alcohol, but as a 23 year old so much of socializing with my peers has to do with going out to bars and other settings that involve alcohol.  To be honest, I also just really miss that happy drunk girl. I do not want to refer to alcohol as ""my escape"" though it certainly sounds like it, but kicking back with my friends on the weekend over a few drinks used to be something that I really looked forward to and now I just worry about it.  I am not the type of person who could go out and feel comfortable at a bar/club scene sober.  But I also know that I can't continue to have this be the outcome of my drinking.  I guess what I am trying to ask is do you think it's possible that I can get back to a place where I am able to have positive drinking experiences? Or have I ruined my relationship with alcohol for good? nn(I have a diagnosed panic disorder and I also take wellbutrin for depression/anxiety if that helps/makes a difference)"

For my whole life I’ve dealt with social anxiety disorder as well as generalized anxiety disorder. These affect my daily life pretty badly but I’m usually able to keep my head above water and get through the school day despite being completely exhausted. I go to a small private school and luckily have been able to take advantage of some of their mental health outlets (such as a calming room, in school therapist appointments,etc.). Although these things exist for me and I have a few places to go if I’m really struggling, I’ve been petrified of going to school. Today was the first day back from winter break and I couldn’t even muster up the courage to go. I was so stressed out that i didn’t sleep at all last night. The reasons I’ve been terrified to go to are as follows:n1. Before winter break I had an important presentation that went terribly. I stuttered, shook, and could not get through the presentation very well. This set off a string of anxiety and panic attacks the rest of the day. Because I was struggling so bad I went to the calming room, but as soon as I stepped out of the room an hour later, I had more panic attacks. It got so bad I thought I was going to pass out so I ended up running into the nearest classroom to ask for help. The crowded hallways affected me so severely. n2. Following this, during winter break I could not even go into a store. I love shopping, but I couldn’t step foot in a store without having a panic attack. How was I supposed to spend 8 hours at school when I couldn’t even spend 20 minutes in a store? n3. My panic attacks make me feel like I’m dying or having a medical emergency and I don’t feel comfortable at school n4. I’ve lost all motivation and can’t even focus on work. I failed two of my exams because I was so anxious I couldn’t understand what the questions were asking nnI couldn’t sleep last night because I was pondering on these things. I don’t take any meds (which may change soon) and my counselor is planning to meet with me when I return to school to create a plan to help me feel more comfortable at school. nI’m very frustrated because I feel pathetic and weak. It’s hard for me to talk about this with people I’m close with, such as my long term boyfriend and best friend because they’re extroverted and confident in social situations. They don’t really understand, though they try to, but I just feel as if I come across as stupid. This is severely affecting my life and I feel trapped, even to the point where I wish I could just disappear. I just want the old me back. Even though I’m usually anxious 24/7, I miss when I could go to school without having a panic attack. nMy physical symptoms are the worst thing and they make me panic more, them being:n- shaking and feeling weak n-dissociation n-dizziness and faintness n- stomach ache or IBSn- strongggg fatigue ‼️n- confusion or lack of focus n- shortness of breath n- heart palpitationsnnPlease give me any tips you have that you think would help me.

There were periods in my childhood/adolescence where my level of anxiety fluctuated, but as a whole, I would never venture outside of the social barriers I had. I was constantly told growing up that it would get better as I aged, that ""nervousness/shyness"" was just something young people felt, that it was just a byproduct of teenage angst. Yet, I'm now 25 and I feel so much more anxiety than I did when I was in high school, another bad period of my life. It's gotten to points where I actively avoid my siblings (I live with my parents still and they regularly visit) when they come over, skipping a meal or two for the day.nnBecause of my extreme fear of being around family, I stay upstairs almost 24/7, only going downstairs to sneak a meal in the middle of the night. For more than 8 years, my body has attuned to a 25-hour sleep cycle due to when I eat, looking at the computer screen/light all day/night, and lack of physical exertion. I can't function like a normal human being for more than a day, and during my brief moments where I show signs of improvement, I go back to the same old routine...sleep, wake up, use the computer, eat at 3AM in the morning, go back to sleep.nnWhen I say I can't function, I literally can't. I have never held down a job, I'm degree-less, and I have no skills. I'm worthless to any company. I would be a nervous wreck who struggles at the slightest sign of any work-related pressure. I have no basic knowledge of how to handle everyday finances. My anxiety has kept me from starting, let alone completing, almost all the milestones of adulthood, and it doesn't show signs of letting up.nnAnd everyone around me is aware of it. Yet, they're okay with it! They enable me to be this way! I keep being told ""you can't do this alone"" but whenever I ask for help I get no answers or we get into a big argument and afterwards forget and go back to the same old cycle. I'm just a skinny lanky man-child who hides in his room and sneaks downstairs for scraps like a common mouse.nnThe mantra I like to repeat to myself to cope is ""I'm so stupid."" Whenever I think of a past moment that makes me cringe at how embarrassing or stupid I was, that's what I say to myself quietly. I've lost count of how often I've said it. It's a bad thing to keep saying, but it comforts me knowing that I at least am self-aware about that aspect of me. Sometimes I say it angrily. Sometimes I say it in the stupidest accents I can think of. It's also now my personal catchphrase when I catch myself saying something I wanted to retract but now can't because it's now said out loud.nnA lot of times, I feel traumatized by how my family treated me when I was growing up. I always remember how they emotionally abused me and kept me feeling down and wanting to die. Now that years have passed, they've ""moved on,"" but I haven't. I still remember the times when I asked for advice and emotional support and they shunned me for any combination of reasons.

The workload it’s self is already so stressful, I work 4-5 days a week, opening to closing (10 hrs) in an environment where many customers are rude and most of my coworkers don’t respect/care about me. Half of me wants to leave so bad but the other half thinks I’m overreacting and wants to stay bc they pay well. I don’t know what to do at this point, should I look for somewhere new or is this how every job is gonna be and I shouldn’t even bother? n(TLDR) My work environment has been making me extremely anxious lately and I don’t know whether I should stay or not."
6033,"Grey288","post","Looking for ways to Deal with Loneliness","As the title says implies, I'm looking for strategies to better cope with loneliness. nnI'm in my last week of summer vacation before I start another year of college, and I'm looking back at the last several months realizing how little I've done. At the start of the summer, I made a promise to myself about being more outgoing, or at least willing to make friends. Then reality and responsibility took hold and nothing ever came of it. Looking ahead, my school doesn't offer much social opportunity either because I go online. Additionally, I work for my parents and, in my current situation, lack opportunities for much else right now.nnI have two people I frequently communicate with, both of whom I met on Reddit. While I care about them both deeply and considering them close friends, I guess it's not the same as inhabiting the same space with someone else. Since both of them are also busy with their lives and are very far away, it's not like I can just call them up and ask to meet over coffee, hang out over a movie, or anything ""normal.""nnSocial interaction, especially in person, has never been my strong suit, and this hasn't improved with time. I grew up friendless and rarely left the house. My parents would suggest social opportunities, but they never really forced me into anything. I always had the final call and, almost every time, I'd reject their offers. Aside from social anxiety, I also tended to isolate myself due to some severe mental health issues. Essentially, I stopped caring about myself and sunk into a deep depression. I'm better now, at least mentally, but those experiences set a bad precedent. nnI turned 22 this past July. Just like last year, and every year for the last eight, it sunk in how I've never had a girlfriend or even an IRL friend. To stress, I take the full blame for this and hold nobody else accountable for my mistakes. I simply don't know how to fix those issues right now. As such, over the past few days, I've just felt lonely. I feel guilty, but even talking to my online friends has made those feelings worse. They both make my life better, but I also understand what I'm feeling is probably not making me the most pleasant person. nnEssentially, I'm just looking for ways to cope with loneliness until I can better position myself to pursue a healthier lifestyle. Also, I'm well aware I should be in therapy -- I'm already there, but my therapist is on maternity leave until October. Any advice would be deeply appreciated. nnThank you!"

My 24th birthday was two weeks ago from tomorrow and I celebrated it without anyone close to me. It was at that moment that I realized I needed to step up and actively combat my anxiety for my life to have any chance of improving. Still, I have a few fears:nn* I only have one close friend irl at the moment and therefore, I joined two meetup groups in an attempt to establish better connections. Ostensibly, I’m a nerd and a gamer, but I fear that my potential new friends will judge me for not getting to play many games growing up and will think I’m practically an old man for my age. nn* I’m starting to date via apps such as OKCupid and did manage to secure one. I’m scared my dates will judge me for having relatively little sexual experience. (I’ve only had sex a few times) I’m also scared they will judge me for my living situation (more on that below).n* I live with my parents still, since my line of work is hard to break into (Writing). I did secure an internship from home recently, which has the potential to move into full time work. I’m terrified that a potential partner will judge me for this.n* I’ve come to the realization this last year that I’m fairly happy with only a close friend or two, yet I believe even an introvert should get out of the house semi-regularly. Can I balance both the loner and involved lifestyles?n* I’m trying to lose a lot of weight and so far have succeeded. I cut out all junk food, soda, alcohol and fried foods and don’t eat meat three days a week. I exercise by jogging 5 miles a day.n* I’ve re-entered therapy, since it’s extremely beneficial to my well-being.nnAm I too old to gain a decent social life, partner and job? I mentally feel like a teenager rather than a 24 year old man and fear that I can’t make up for lost time. My only choice is to try now to secure a possibly better future, yet I fear I’ll fail in spite of my efforts. Any success stories?"
6049,"CodeineKrazy","post","I absolutely don't want to start working","First ever post on this sub. I don't know if anyone's gonna read this but I just need to type my thoughts down. nnI'm in my last year of high school and had one final exam left to do. If I pass, I graduate. Now, I already have a job and normally I have to start tomorrow.  Although I already worked there for a bit during my internship, I was and still am overwhelmed with depressive and anxious thoughts. Earning money and making a living for myself should feel like a new beginning but to me it feels like the end of my life. It feels like from now on, I have to worry every single day about (possible) social interactions with lots of different people untill the day I retire. The last few years I didn't really go to school that much so I was most of the time somewhat comfortable at home. Due to these thoughts I couldn't concentrate myself at all on studying so it's very likely I'll fail. This, however, doesn't change the fact that I have to start working but it made me feel extra bad. Also nobody will understand how I still manage to fail the only exam I had.nnThis situation combined with daily (non-prescribed) drug use got me thinking about finally seeing a therapist. I still live at home and will be telling my mother about it if I don't chicken out.  Chances are also that I just send a mail to my employer saying that I'm ill 'till next week to give me some more breathing space.nnI guess I don't really know what the point of my post is and it probably sounds silly but I just needed to tell someone. If anyone has some advice or similar experiences I would appreciate it. Also sorry for possible spelling mistakes."
6053,"AmericanLion24","post","DO I or DON'T I have social anxiety DISORDER","I know I have issues with social anxiety. But, I'm not sure if it would qualify as having SAD or if I'm just really shy. I know the only way to truly find out is to be diagnosed but, you know, thats scary and expensive. See, I avoid social interactions like the plague but I don't seem to exhibit the physical symptoms that most others with SAD seem to experience. I do get butterflies in my stomach and sometimes sweat excessively however, most times I just feel afraid. I don't tremble, or get nauseous. Sometimes I think maybe I only avoid social situations because I know that I'm terrible at them. My social skills and conversational skills are horrible and its ruined my whole life. I'm 24 years old and I've never had a job other than a seasonal retail job which I hated. I do have a degree, but I have no life anymore. It's gotten especially depressing since I graduated from college. Now I go through long stretches of weeks where I don't leave the house. I don't have any friends at all other than a couple of online-only friends. If it wasn't for my brothers inviting me out once in a while I would never get out at all. I've never had a gf, kissed anyone, or anything like that. I don't even drive yet. I avoid all of these things because I'm afraid of having to interact with people. But, again the physical symptoms don't seem to be there. IT's all mental. I'm just confused and sometimes think I just use SAD as an excuse to not do things."
6055,"ithinkimjesus420","post","Some advice","Ask yourself, why am I really anxious? Why does it matter what people think of me?nThe truth is that this is your life and yours only. There is no shame in embracing who are and stepping out into the world, cause everyone is in this thing together. It doesn't matter what people think of you because their thoughts about you shouldn't and don't affect your life. Having anxiety can often make someone judging or staring at you feel the same as having a gun held to your head. In truth, everyone has their own thoughts, looks different and has their own opinions. So why should you have to suppress yourseld at the will of others who are just as human as you? Being judged by others doesn't actually affect your life, you just perceive it that way. Trying to be a people pleaser or being scared of others judgement will only lead you to continually seeking validation externally. In reality, you and how you feel about yourself is all that matters.nI therapist recently gave me a helpful analogy: You have to treat life as a playground rather than a high wire. On a playground, the decisions you make don't have real implications and there is room for mistakes, but also enjoyment. Having anxiety is like living life on a hire wire. You tread carefully and over analyse every decision you make, leaving no room to actually enjoy life.nJust do you. Cause that's all that matters!"
6059,"eaglesoftheeast","post","My anxiety makes adults nervous?","Although I (F 14) have never been clinically diagnosed with any anxiety disorder but I'm pretty sure I've had some kind of social anxiety since I was little. This comes with a whole host of problems, but especially when dealing with adults.nnWhenever I was in a class, group, activity etc with other kids, led by an adult, the adult would always treat me differently. This would range from being concerned about me all the time (which is ok) to being outright rude or avoiding me (which is annoying as f*CK) . Some would try not to speak to me and direct all their speech towards the other kids, some would be unnecessarily cold or blunt towards me, some would engage in jokes or poke fun at the other kids and not speak to me. nnI always wondered why, as this has made me even more scared of talking to adults and sometimes it just feels bad to be left out. I think one reason is because I'm noticeably quieter than the other kids, but they often talk to the other quiet kids and avoid me. I mentioned it to my dad and he said I make adults nervous because I never smile and apparently I also have a cold stare. I never noticed this (although it's true - I don't smile and either make awkwardly direct or no eye contact). Still, I'm fine with other people my age - why does it freak adults out so much?  nnHas anybody else had the same problem?"

Never really made friends in college and ive been virtually alone for years, coming home every day angry at myself and frustrated that yet another day i passed the day like a ghost. some days i never even pronounced a single word. Every year i give myself more time telling to me that i just need time so things can fall into place by themselves. A lie. i refuse to keep coming home with that feeling for eternity, knowing the life im missing for my idiocy. I always think how different things could have been for me if ive made very little changes in my behaviour at certain times. today if i could have literally saluted certain person (i was about to do it) then the persons that followed could have engaged with me. That people are the ones i could have easily made partners with for the rest of the season. Now they add this utter lame day to the data they alredy have from me. It has become a titanic labor to talk to them. Plus theres a really nice girl i want to get closer in that small group. the first year we talked circumstancially and one day my anger and issues were so big i just stopped talking to her and mostly everyone. She must feel really bad not knowing what happened. She doesnt deserve that. I dont even know what to do now. I must do something.

I only need to provide some background to add context to my request for advice.nnI’m 21 years old, a new senior in college. Due to an abusive home life, an overprotective mother who would not let me interact extensively with other children, and many other things, I was left behind socially. To this day I have a mild social anxiety, combined with intense social awkwardness. Up to now I have never had a lasting friendship, nor a relationship. This eats away at me every day, and I fear I will die old and alone.nnNevertheless, I have gone to multiple therapists and they all tell me the best way to make friends is to join clubs or find common interests. But the issue is... I have no interests. Never really did, in fact. I’m not an athletic person, and in fact I have a condition known as developmental coordination disorder (albeit a mild form) which makes succeeding athletically basically impossible. At least I’m scrawny instead of morbidly obese.nnNot really in board games or reading either. All I basically do is dick around on reddit and deal with my classes as the hope of a fulfilling existence dwindles away from me.nnThat said, I do not think I have depression. Depression is often observed through a loss of interest in things, but I never really had interests in things to begin with. I also don’t see my deep upset as a chemical imbalance, but a natural response to the circumstances at hand. nnI have always been a boring person by nature. If I had a girl to cuddle with in bed all day, and do literally nothing else, and maybe a few friends to have some drinks with, my life would probably be made. Nevertheless I am well aware that the world doesn’t work that way.nnI can’t help it. I’m boring. But I do want to connect with people and don’t have interest in that many things.

My words usually come out a mess and don’t make any sense so I believe I’m also socially awkward great :) nnI feel as though my social anxiety developed as a result of being rejected and judged negatively by sooooo many different groups of people that I wouldn’t be able to count. I was bullied from early childhood up until highschool for being gay (effeminate). And this has caused a deeply rooted sense of anxiety especially when it comes to my sexuality and how I present myself. nnI’m currently in college and I thought that college was supposed to be where I found my “people”. My mom and everyone would say you’re going to meet tons of people like you NO. NOT THE CASE AT ALL. nnMy social anxiety is so bad I can’t connect WITH ANYONE and it’s so frustrating. I suck at casual conversation. Sense I’m a hermit with no friends when someone asks me about ANYTHING I don’t know what to say and they’re like DO YOU LIVE UNDER A ROCK AND I’m just sitting there looking dumb and feeling bad. nnI’m at the age where I want a boyfriend but I feel like I will NEVER EVER HAVE THAT. my confidence and self esteem is so fucking low to the point I can’t even participate in class without my speech trembling or me getting nervous or sounding monotone. The monotony in my voice is due to SOCIAL ANXIETY I’m almost certain as a defense mechanism because at home I can be as expressive as ever but I can’t translate that in conversations. nnIt’s ruining my life things I should normally enjoy doing I can’t because it’s like social anxiety is always there to “keep me in check” making sure I can’t ever experience happiness or that level of intimacy with another person that I’ve been deprived of. nnMy social anxiety has caused me to be boring, not funny, unconfident in myself, a social reject and I hate it I hate myself for it I wish I could be anyone else but myself. nnPeople always say be yourself but I DONT KNOW WHO TF THAT IS nnBasic shit such as participating in class makes me feel like a pussy because while although I do it from time to time, sometimes I don’t because I’m scared if I say something the dudes in my class will gang up on what I said making fun of it and I won’t know how to defend myself in the situation and I’ll have al eyes on me showing everyone how weak I am. nnnI dont even like talking to people like that unless they intrigue me and I find them interesting or I’m physically attracted to them. This I feel is also caused by social anxiety because due to me being bullied so much I just expect everyone to hate me and judge me negatively so I’ve started hating people and not trusting GUYS -the same species I’m attracted to. nnI feel like I’ll never have any friends NEVER have a boyfriend and won’t ever be able to live comfortably in life. nnThere’s people out there who don’t even know wtf I’m talking about when I mention social anxiety and I’m like must be fucking nice Let’s trade PLEASEE. nnI’m frankly getting fucking sick and tired of caring soooo much about what everyone thinks and to an extent I DONT but then my brain and body says I do by giving me ALL THESE MERVES AND ANXIETY AND IM SO FED UP I WANT TO GET rid of it nnAnd yes I have contemplated ending it all because of this because if I have no friends or a job and can’t connect with anyone then what use do I have? It’s almost as if I’m not needed and no one would notice or care that I would be gone anyways (don’t mean for it to get this dark)nnI really dislike dark shit like that but the social anxiety inhibits every possible aspect of joy in my life that thoughts like these seep in. nnnI just want to get rid of it please give me a quick fix I feel like I’m running out of time I’ve been dealing with this for way too long and more than anything I just want a solid couple of friends who I connect with deeply and consider real friends, a BOYFRIEND, and to not have these bad ass nerves nnnI’m all for tackling shit head on and I don’t believe in anxiety medication so dont suggest that.

6085,"alexgiann25","post","My progress with social anxiety and some tips","For the past 5 years (im 15) I've been dealing with social anxiety and it has been making my life much more difficult than it has to be. My SA peaked when I was around 13-14 and since then I've been constantly trying to overcome it, I'm finally starting to see some progress, and I thought that you guys might find my methods of overcoming and coping with it helpful. nnI believe that what has made the biggest impact on my social anxiety is how confident I am with my looks. Last year, I was wearing clothes I didn't like, I had a haircut I hated and I didn't treat my acne at all. This year, my wardrobe is full of clothes I like wearing and am confident in, I got a haircut I like and my acne is properly treated and way better than last year. Also, I've been taking care of my hygiene a lot more and this also has helped me a lot with my confidence. nnAnother thing that has also played a major role in making me less socially anxious is pushing my limits. For example, I have started talking more in class. Instead of hiding and wishing that the teacher doesn't pick me, I raise my hand to talk when I feel like I know the answer. This way I control what question I'm going to answer, and I also am prepared to talk. Over time I got more and more confident talking in front of the class, and it's now less of a challenge. nnSomething that many of us struggle with is those embarrassing memories that come to mind throughout the day and just make you feel like shit. My way of coping with that is just forcing myself to think of anything but that until my thoughts drift away from it. Also, another way to get rid or make those memories less embarrassing is talking to another person about them. May it be an online friend or a relative or your therapist, it is always a relief getting it out of your chest. nnOverall, some general tips from me would be:nn1. Find what you don't like on you, and prioritize fixing itn2. Pushing your limits in social situationsn3. Avoiding embarrassing thoughtsn4. Talking to others about your embarrassing momentsnnThank you for reading this, I'm hoping this helps you progress, and finally, get over your social anxiety."

I only talk about it with my boyfriend but not even that much cause I'm scared it's super annoying and whiny.

But we just dont talk very much and Im kind of to blame for that.nnI just, I can't seem to find the energy to keep up with anyone anymore. The only people I can interact with are people Im just around by default now, and its never anything meaningful. Just jokes in passing. Idk. I didnt always have this issue. But people kept screwing me over.nn I lost one of my best friends after he told me we were doing molly and he gave me meth, then confessed a bunch of horrible shit he was doing to me behind my back. Then tried to cover it up. Now we arent friends anymore and hes telling everyone Im on heroin and a bunch of fucked up shit because he's mad at me for cutting him out of my life. nnThen I kind of lost my newest group of friends, because they were originally my boyfriend at-the-times friends and it was a bad breakup.

I feel like most people just want to use me for temporary gratification. Some do. Every time I put effort into a new conversation, its like my responses dont matter and they just want me to build them up, or they have some imaginary version of myself in their head and literally try to project their own reactions onto me. nnI just feel like nobody new is interested in getting to know -me-. Like everyone just wants me to respond the way they want to be responded to. And its not just being nice, I like to be nice and supportive towards people.

By the time I finally say, hey, youre not really hearing me out on this, they just get mad and go ""well unfriend me then"". So I block them. nnI guess a lot of the issue is that I get most attempts at ""friendship"" are just guys who dont even know me, putting a ton of pressure on me to be this person they put together in their heads.nnI started making friends with this one guy. Just started, and he started ""testing"" me to see if Id follow him around at a party I was invited to. The party sucked but Im not going to follow someone around like a lost puppy.nn Then cue literally essays and essays of him just messaging me complete nonsense. It was like he was talking as himself and replying as me. It freaked me out. A couple weels later and I bumped into his sister, who was always really sweet to me, and she informed me he had a psychotic break around that time and was diagnosed as schizophrenic.nnMy last best friend, the one who tricked me into doing meth (really he was just ashamed of himself for doing it and so tried to trick me and a couple people later into getting hooked on it so he wouldnt be alone) was also schizophrenic. He. Was. Crazy. He did horrible, horrible things to me behind my back. And he always found a way to make himself a victim. I never, EVER did anything to wrong him, I always gave him the benefit of the doubt, I always put myself in his shoes and tried my best to console him and guide him towards doing the right thing. I did this for 3 years. I always supported him. I treated him better than myself, because I wanted him to succeed and have a solid support system if everything else fell through.nn And meanwhile, he was stealing naked photos of me from my phone. He tried to blackmail me and made like 5 or 6 facebook accounts because Id block them everytime. He told his other friends who I didnt know, that I was having sex with him. He sexually harassed my sister. He stole from me. He took literally all my trust, and shit all over it, ate that shit, and then threw it up. When my brother died from a heroin over dose, he started telling people I picked up heroin. All because he was mad I didnt want to be with him. He never even asked me if I would consider it, he was just mad at me for treating him like a friend instead of a boyfriend. When in actuality I was supporting him better than I probably would have supported my own boyfriend. nnI think thats why Im so scared of people now. He was my best friend from 17 to 20. For 3 years we would hang out almost every day. For 3 years he absolutely disgraced and betrayed me behind my back. And I never noticed because I thought I could see the good in him even when no one else could. Because I always gave him the benefit of the doubt. nnAnd now. I just dont feel like I know anyone anymore. The only person I feel like I can truly trust is my sister and my best friend. Im just too scared to care about anyone after that. Im too scared to get invested in any more friendships. Im always scared they will be doing or thinking terrible things about me behind my back. nnAnd my relationships since then and during then have always resulted in me getting burned. They've all ended in me getting cheated on, being treated like I was literally crazy because ""hey, i noticed this and this, it kind of makes me uneasy so can we address it so i dont think about it too much""nnThe only people who have deserved the pedestal Ive put them on are my sister and my best friend. The other friend, well shes just not emotionally available to anyone. Shes good for talking about drama, but I dont like that past a certain point. Im worried she talks about me the way shes talked about her other friends (albeit some of them were genuinely shitty people) but theres just a coldness about her. I dont know. I love her just as much its just hard to be close to her. nnI guess I should just be happy I have the people I do. But i wish that I didnt have to worry so much. I wish I was as open as I used to be. I guess Ive just learned some really hard life lessons. And it makes me wary. And it makes it hard to appreciate anyone new, especially when new people like to burn me just the same. nnI just also dont want to miss out on all the good people out there because of my own insecurities. nnIll probably talk to a therapist about it. Writing this all out has kind of let me see the issues are still hurting me. Sorry for the book."

I had two very close friends in school, but then I had to take two years off before college due to depression and anxiety. My two best friends moved country and although we talk now and then, they have both moved on with their lives (engaged, progressing well in their careers, looking at settling down etc) whereas I’ve only just finished college and started my first real job as a nurse. So we’re at very different places in our lives and we can’t really relate to each other the way we used to.nnI made no friends in four years of college because of social anxiety and depression. Every time I tried to go out or socialize I would get panic attacks in front of everyone and leave. Then I’d be so humiliated that I’d avoid anyone who I’d panicked in front of. I’ve never been in a relationship or had sex either, as any time things would start to get intimate I would panic.nnI love my job as a nurse and it does get me out of the house. But recently I’ve had episodes of panic in front of my colleagues and it’s just really fucking humiliating every time it happens. On top of this I work irregular hours as a nurse so it’s difficult to keep up counseling appointments to help with the anxiety, or to join clubs or have hobbies where I can meet people.nnMy life is incredibly lonely. I’m staying with my mum at the moment because I’m looking for somewhere to rent (and because I’m extremely depressed atm and she thought I needed some support). She’s great company and a great help, but she’s a busy woman and when she’s at work or abroad on business all I do is sit at home and watch TV or go on the internet. I have nobody to do anything with, and nobody to talk to. I have two pet parrots who keep me sane but even though I love them, I wish I had a friend or a partner of my own. nnI feel like anxiety is stopping me from enjoying life and being happy. I’ve been like this for so long and it just feels like it’s never going to change, I feel like I’m always going to be frightened and lonely and unsatisfied with life because I can’t control this thing"

I’m suppose to meet with him again in two weeks in November. My goal is to face one fear every single day for two weeks until my next session. I started today by walking the campus and meeting a stranger who also told me how lonely they were. Nothing major happened but I initiated the conversation and broke through the first stage of the anxiety. I didn’t waste any time making the first movement today. I’m bracing for these next two weeks so I can return to my therapist with news of improvement. nnIf you’re reading this I know it’s hard as hell out there.

Please skim read the next paragraph, I doubt you'll care about it.nnI think I had a normal early childhood. This normal life started to deviate when I was around 10, few years after moving out from my grandparents' household. Since then, social interactions severely decreased outside school peers (almost all my friends were my classmates); I think this is where self-diagnosed SAD developed. Six years later, I rarely talked and met with them because I transferred to a different school. I met new friends there, but pandemic screwed everything up, and I were unable to ""fix"" my social life. Now I'm almost 19.nnSince I transferred school, I noticed some self destructive behaviours ""seemingly outside"" usual SAD symptoms that I will elaborate:n(1) Trust issues - not the usual ""I can't believe them, they are lying and betray me,"" but rather ""I can't tell them, they will tell others and ridicule me."" I never tell anyone how i feel nor open up ,thus relationships do not progress,n(2) Suppressed thoughts - I never confront people, probably caused by inferiority complex,n(3) Obsession with the concept of equality - I get envious when my peers succeed, I feel disgusted when I succeed my peers. This is purely for peers; I do not care if strangers do better than me and vice versa, as long as I and my relations are not affected,n(4) Possessiveness [?] - I find myself clingy and also crave their recognition. When I start socialising with them, I never want it to end. I don't talk to them if we are not associated in a while.nnWritten from memory; I do not take note of these so I surely might have missed some, but I feel they're enough.nnI think I will be evading socialisation as a result.

(And for possible spelling errors.)nnI (18M) am nearing the end in my first semester in college far from my home and I just need some advice. My biggest issue is making connections with people. I can orate publicly when presenting things but causal conversation kills me. It’s not that I’m afraid of what people think, more thank I always feel drained when talking to people and then always run out of anything meaningful to say after 2 sentences and just end up nodding then leaving. Throughout my life I’ve always had a small group of friends, and while I have made friends here, it isn’t a lot. Most of my free time is between working out, drawing, watching TV shows (mostly anime), and playing video games. I’d like to get out of my dorm more which I do when there are game nights and other events going on and it is fun (Ex. Had a ton of fun meeting people at a smash bros tourney in our dorm.) But going to football games fills me with anxiety and usually isn’t so fun and I usually leave by halftime. Other than the events and scenarios mentioned before and my classes I’m usually in my room Infront of a screen. My anxiety stemmed from an eye condition I have that makes my eyes not be in the intended direction at times (it was bad as child but after surgery and treatment it is hardly as noticeable unless looking directly at them closely). Because of that condition I can't look people in the eyes. That and no matter what facial cleanser I try to use (currently using Neutrogena Oil-free Acne Wash) my cheeks become a breeding ground for acne and through a series of different razors (close and non-close shave) my under chin is a bumpy as a chipped road. Whenever I ask my mother about it and suggest a dermatologist, she continues to show her MLM product which shockingly doesn’t work (but that’s a whole can of worms on its own, not the best relationship.). So any products that can help that situation would be appreciated.nnI’d like to go out more, maybe go to a party but I need to get my whole situation together before I can even think about that.nnAny advice to feel more confident and more accustomed social situations. Skin care advice also accepted."
6195,"hambone2101","post","SA from stuttering","For the nearly 18 years of my existence, I've been wondering what caused me to have such an overwhelming social phobia. I've been introverted all my life, but the extent to which I get anxious from socialising isn't what I'd consider normal for any sort of person.nnJust a few months ago, I somehow only came to the conclusion then that the majority of my anxiety probably came from the fact I have a pretty bad stutter. I can't quite remember when it began (probably around 6 or 7), but when I was in primary school, I vividly remember nearly every day I went there, other kids made fun of my stutter, and the more I was teased, and sometimes borderline bullied, the more I avoided socialising with others, including my friends, because I was scared I would get teased again. From 4 years of that experience at primary school, when I started high school when I was 12, I was already beginning to become a social wreck.nnFor the past 11 years, the stutter has not gotten better, and I'm still the same social wreck I've always been for most of my life. I've been to a few speech therapists, but they haven't worked. It's sort of a catch 22. Because of my stutter, I become socially anxious, but because I become anxious, the stutter gets worse. nnFor those who don't know what it's like, the best way I can describe what having a stutter is like is like having a barrier you have to push through in every sentence you utter. Sometimes you'll break through it after many attempts, and sometimes you'll be unable to break through and just give up. This means normal interaction is almost impossible, as you'll always be interrupted with stuttering. Delivering jokes effectively is impossible. Giving a speech is hard enough for someone with SA, but a nightmare when you add a stutter in the mix. Hell, normal interaction is bloody difficult. nnSo yeah, this is my experience living with SA with a stutter. Being teased to no end about it has caused me to reject social interaction, as well as become frightened of it, as I still fear I'll still be teased about it. It hasn't happened nearly as bad in high school, but there's still that odd person."

But about a year before the pandemic my mental health started spiralling, I stopped university. I was crying everyday, wouldn’t leave my bed, smoking everyday. At least I was sober by the time the pandemic hit. But I had an excuse to isolate even further. nnI’ve realised I’ve always had a close friend I’d cling to, be unhealthily obsessed with. I also shut down other relationships very quickly by not even showing up, i.e. responding to messages. I’ve found myself at almost 23, a very socially inept person eek. My one strength was my vulnerability and ability to be friendly with anyone even if I was awkward. Now I’m bitter and paranoid after losing almost all my close friendships. nnI’ve neglected pretty much all relationships in my life to an extent. Maybe I’m blaming myself too much idk. But my life has consisted of just my bed for so long. nnI need to learn to socialise better, and take care of all my relationships. Well, myself first. So I stop doing whatever it is I’m doing. Putting too much pressure on people. Idk. I’ve been on a waiting list for interpersonal relationships therapy for about a year. nnI think a lot of people have felt let down by me. And now they’re just over it. But also I feel like people like reaching out to an idea of me, and get very bored/disappointed by the real thing. When I open up properly they tend to look awkward or dip. I’ve also gotten uglier, and lost my sense of humour. And my sharpness. When I realise all this, i understand why people dip. Then I feel like, okay I need to isolate and improve myself because I can’t see people like this. I’m a drain. And then it’s a vicious cycle.

It hasn’t been useless, but for me it seems it can only do so much. I don’t enjoy life one bit and I look forward to the end of each day when I can just sleep. It’s getting the best of me, and it may sound like I’m not trying to get through it but I have been. It’s still very hard and when I’m trying to feel confident it feels like I’m just lying to myself. I dread going outside even though I want to. The times I do get out I’m uncomfortable and can’t enjoy myself.nI know it sounds like I’m a pessimist and complainer, which I kind of am, but I’m in the least optimistic mood right now and I’m tired of putting in all my effort to feel positive when it just doesn’t stick. I’ve put in a lot of mental effort to get better, and I’ve had some good periods, but I always end back up where I am right now. I’ve made a lot of improvements over the years with going outside, getting a job, getting comfortable around people etc, but now it’s like it’s never happened because I’m back at square one and as anxious as ever.nnAnyway, I wanted to know if getting medication requires therapy alongside it. I took Lexapro a few years ago for a very short time and had a therapist. I stopped both, and I really would prefer not to have to see a therapist. I know they can be very helpful, but I just don’t want to deal with one again right now for my own reasons.nnSorry if I seem like such a defeatist. I’m know I’m depressed and have been for a while and just writing this is embarrassing for me, but I feel like I’m at a dead end and I have nobody else in my life to talk to about this. I do have my mom, and she’s amazing, but she has a lot of her own mental problems that she’s absorbed in.nnSorry if this seems long. I appreciate anyone who reads this and just figured I’d finally reach out to maybe hear from at least one other person out there."
6325,"ChromaGreen","post","Social Anxiety - My Experience","Thought I'd share some stuff and see how relatable I am here!nnSince around maybe 7 years ago, the beginning of high school, I have struggled to speak to people, mainly in situations of casual conversation with friends in school. I just have no idea how to talk in a conversation or what to say. Everybody else at this school seemed to be pretty extroverted too, and so I felt very much singled out from them all, because I was pretty different. I'm yet to meet anybody who shares this trait, as it seems I have been surrounded by more confident people my entire life. In school I have indeed received the well-known comments of ""why are you so quiet?"" and ""you don't talk much, do you?""nnWhen in a situation where I am with certain friends or in the same room as somebody trying to talk to me, I struggle to figure out what to say. Though, when in the midst of these situations, I am not sure I feel as much as I have seen others describe. The most I feel is some discomfort and the desire to escape and be on my own again, though I suppose this is enough to show some level of anxiety.nnWhile I do feel discomforted in social situations usually, I also find that I can be fairly confident in some things, such as ordering in a restaurant. Perhaps this is because I know what I want to say already, so I can rehearse it in my head, and so it's quite straight forward.nnI am not entirely sure how it even started, it just occurred to me one day that I was like this. It may have been from the bits of bullying here and there that I unfortunately encountered, or maybe it was just due to how much easier it is to get on with other kids when you're much younger, and then that changes.  nI'm at university now and it is continuing into my adulthood at 20 years old, where I don't really talk to anyone because I feel bad for anyone who has to be in the same room as me. But I don't mind.. but I really should mind more, and try exposure therapy..nnThank you for reading, if you did! Means a lot, actually! :)"

I've heard of people where the family is really supporting with their anxiety which sounds like a dream to me. nI never got diagnosed with anxiety but I always related to what other people said here. I've always had troubles talking to others, making friends etc. ( I lived alone in a new city for some months and didn't make any friends and barely talked to anyone). The past weeks my mind got really stressed and I'm really scared of having an internship soon. I wish I could talk to my family about it but I'm so scared. They usually think I'm lazy or weird. The first time where I told my sister that I'm feeling scared of basically everything and got troubles with socialising, she called me retarded and didn't want to even try to listen or understand. I feel so alone with these thoughts and just wish someone could try to understand."

It actually like hurts a little bit typing that out. Even with people my own age, who obviously know/have played games before. I guess I feel like ""shame"" with liking games or else this apprehension wouldn't happen. I'll try to like come up with something else if someone asks me what I like to do, like I'm not making stuff up, I tell other things that I do other than play games, but I will keep that side under several locks and several keys.nnFor example, when my therapist asked me what I like to do, I said like ""oh you know, I do typical 19 year old stuff, play guitar, do homework, hang out with my friends, that kind of thing"" Basically not mentioning it at all. And when she mentioned games just in an offhand comment, I had like an internal reaction to it.nnThe funny part is, I don't play games that often anymore, (Depression and stuff is a bitch) but yet I just die inside at the mention.nnAnyone else?"

Thank you in advance if you do :)nnSo I’m 17F and for the better part of my life I’ve had social anxiety. I’m so tired of being scared to talk to my own friends and feeling sick/dizzy every time I’m in an unknown place. As a desperate attempt—call it ‘exposure therapy’, if you will—I’ve decided to move away for university, and none of my friends are coming with me.nnTo add on to my social anxiety, I’m also very introverted and awful at small talk. I find it hard to connect with people during surface level conversations and I just feel tired after participating in small talk. I also don’t want to rely on weed or alcohol, as those have repercussions on my mental state after the ‘euphoria’ is gone. I’ve developed a big fear of not making friends, not finding friends, and being an outsider because of this. nnThe idea of being all by myself seems so daunting to me but at the same time, I can’t keep living in a bubble of familiarity my whole life. I guess what I’m asking is, does anyone have any tips for moving out of home with social anxiety? Any and all advice is appreciated &lt;3nnPS. I realize that university might not start in fall but I’m preparing for the spring or in case it shockingly DOES start in fall"
6435,"Gottchen","post","My brain is blocked, I'm trapped in my head","Hello dear people,nnI suffer from depression and social anxiety. Lately, I have the problem of turning more and more into myself when I'm out with people and talking with them, I'm literally introverting. I then have a complete block of thoughts and can no longer concentrate on topics or conversations. I'm somehow mostly trapped in my head and I can't think of any topic, idea, joke or anything productive or really informative. A few months ago, it was still possible for me to react with humour, to joke around, to give my opinion about something and to reflect in conversations, in order to maintain a proper conversation. Now it feels like I don't have any opininon or personality. nnEven in the university, in the online lectures or in group work, I can no longer work productively, because my head seems to be completely blocked. I can't think of anything, I can't go into the topics, I can't think about questions, I don't take anything out of the lecture despite being present all the time, because I don't remember anything right after that. Concentration is very poor in university as well as in social contacts. I can't access the thoughts or memories in my head anymore. I feel so empty, shy, anxious, sad and stupid right now. All just bad non-conducive qualities. I feel like being like that I can't offer people anything and it starts making my self confidence go even lower than it already was.nnIn addition to depression and fears, how can one still live properly and at least enjoy life to some extent being like this? Cognitive, mood-related and socially restricted. Has any of you had similar experience, perhaps even in connection with mental disorders such as depression and anxiety? What could you do about it to become more open and extroverted again? To be able to access the thoughts and memories in your head again? nnIs that maybe ADD already? My doctor says we should first get my depression and anxiety under control before we do a concentration test on ADD, because depression and anxiety and years of stress and the confrontation with such mental disorders also very much changes the structure of the brain and the memory, for example especially affects the hippocampus.nnI hope you understand what I mean and maybe you can help me, because like this my life doesn't work according university and social life even less farther than it is possible for me anyway because of the depression and social anxiety. Now my ability to think, concentrate and remember gets less and less too. With that nowhere else do I see a reason to be proud of myself and to build up self-esteem and self-confidence somewhere."

So they go under a rock, get rid of the shell and make a new one. And they repeat this process Everytime they feel the discomfort. If the lobsters had some kind of doctor or solution for the pain. They wouldn't get out of the shell and grow. And what do i mean with that. It's in this moments of stress, when all hope is gone, that we can grow as humans. So stay strong.

6452,"777sadurn777","post","I've never spoken to anyone else with social anxiety as severe as mine - It's made me feel more alien than human for most of my life","Even though I know social anxiety is very real and common, I still feel alone. Even after reading posts in this sub, I still feel like my social anxiety is way more extreme of a case to just simply be social anxiety. I am not saying this because I want to feel special or want pity, but because I finally want to come clean to other humans who may have similar struggles as me. Maybe in the process someone out there reading this can relate to my symptoms as well. I'm just gonna make a bulleted list. Here goes:nn* **I haven't ""hung out"" with anyone but my boyfriend, his parents, my parents, and my grandparents since 2017**. Yes, that is correct. I am a 23 year old female college student that has not spent any quality time with anyone but these people in 3 years. I have had a couple friends online that I have spoken with through text, but no hanging out or video chatting. No voice calls either. And due to anxiety I can't make a decent impression in an interview so I don't have coworkers to talk to. Nothing. Even most of my classes are online now because of anxiety so I don't even have a friend in school.n* **Have never been able to present a project or read in class without crying or fainting:** I am 23 years old now and not once have I been able to get up in front of a class and speak or even real aloud from my seat. Not even in elementary school. I know, this sounds dramatic. But the second I'd walk up there I could feel my legs shaking. My heart racing. Sweating. The nausea. My jaw would lock up. If I even dared to start talking my voice would be shake and my words would turn into alphabet soup. Then the tears would set in. I can't tell you enough how many times I was accused of being too stupid to read by other students. Or how angry teachers would get with me as they pulled me into the hallway and told me this had to stop. In college, I was denied being able to sign up for the special public speaking session because I didn't meet the disability requirement. On my first day in the regular public speaking class I told the professor how bad my anxiety was. I made it very clear that he would need to work with me on this and I would try my best to write a good speech. **Long story short, I passed out during the first speech of the semester, had to get stitches on my head, and was immediately withdrawn from the class. I lost my scholarship due to being withdrawn from the class. Even the next year when I took the special section that was sit-down and only had 9 students, I would tear up, shake, and stutter every time I spoke.** n* **When I try to speak, I can't. The words come out in the wrong order, are stuttered, or I simply forget every word. People have asked me if I was drunk before because it takes me so long to get anything out.** I was almost completely mute as a kid. I had to do speech therapy at school. I was pretty old when I started being able to communicate in sentences with teachers and other staff, but even then it was terrifying to interact. My parents were so confused by this because I could talk to them just fine as a kid. As an adult it has just gotten worse. I do get nervous speaking to my parents now, but it is still easier than speaking to anyone else. I have bombed every job interview I have attempted because the second I open my mouth to speak I can feel the tears well up. The words disappear. I feel faint. I end up speaking in a shaky-on-the-verge-of-tears voice and broken English. The few relationships/friendships I've had are with the people who were okay with me avoiding eye contact and writing letters to them/typing things out and showing them until I felt comfortable speaking in a more intimate manner. Currently I only have two friends that I can speak with and not get so nervous that I forget every single word.n* **I avoid pictures of myself, even though I love taking pictures of other people.** I have opted to not have my picture in yearbooks, to not be included in a lot of pictures at family gatherings or college events or award ceremonies, etc. I have been working hard getting fit this past year and have been trying to convince myself to upload my progress pictures online but...I just can't. And when I change up my hair or like my makeup or do something fun, I wanna take a selfie, but it feels wrong. It feels gross. It feels like I'll just be annoying to everyone who sees it. n* **I can't eat in front of other people without getting sick.** n* **I have always tried to cover as much as my face and body as I can in order to go out in public.** I have always tried to cover most of my face by scarves, masks, glasses, etc. in order to go grocery shopping, drive in my car, go to class, you name it. And I have never worn a bathing suit or shorts in public. No one but my current boyfriend (who is one of the two friends that I can communicate with decently well) has seen my bare legs in years. Even on vacation on a remote beach, I was scared to unwrap the towel from myself and get into the ocean because there were families in the nearby distance who could see me. n* **Eye contact is very painful and I can count on one hand how many people I can maintain eye contact with.** I want to look into peoples' eyes because I WANT to be close and kind with people, but I can't. It hurts. It feels like it's too much. It feels like I'm vulnerable. I feel like I might scare them. n* **Driving is hard because it is people inside cars, so the entire time I drive it feels like my heart is racing like I'm at a dinner party, but even worse because cars can be deadly, so it's like a social gathering made aggressive.**n* **Picking the skin on my hands since I was a toddler:** It started when I was about 3 or 4. Every time I would go anywhere in public - restaurants, groceries, daycare, dance class, even play dates with other kids, I would pick the skin on my hand until I bled. My parents were obviously really concerned that their little girl was doing this. Doctor after doctor just told them it was anxiety and kind of brushed it off. Now as an adult I have scarring on my hands and still pick them quite frequently. I picked them all throughout school and college, and still do if I'm outside and other humans can see me. I do try to stop myself when I notice it. But my brain is so flustered and cloudy in public that I rarely even realize it until I'm home.n* **Wearing plain clothing with no designs in front of others so they can't judge me for what I wear or like.** I actually love cute dresses and creative fashion and my band t-shirt collection, but no one outside would know that. So I have been questioned why I dress so boring my entire life. n* **I have not been able to hold a job.** I attempted working retail/fast food in high school and usually had my first panic attack/crying/fainting event within the first week and was quickly disliked as an employee because I couldn't communicate with customers. I've only had one job that was understanding and moved me to an office job in the back. Since leaving that job I have been unemployed for nearly two years, even with a bachelor's in Computer Science. Because I bomb every. freaking. interview. n* **I love recording music and singing, and do it all the time, but have never posted it. In fact, No one but my family and two friends even know about my musical abilities.**n* **I've tried to join numerous clubs and organizations** and ultimately quit after the first meeting due to the reactions I would get from others when they heard my shaky voice and could barely understand a word that came out of my mouth. Even the ones at my college for people with anxiety. I was always the worst one there and always felt judged like I was a freak of nature or crazy because of the difficulties I have communicating.n* **Can't play multiplayer games online.** I love video games and used to at least be able to play with other humans since there was no face-to-face contact, but those days are long gone and I can only play single player games. Nothing PVP or anything fun like that anymore.nnSo here I am, at 23 years old, working on a Master's in Computer Science that will never be used because I can't pass an interview. I've tried SSRI medications and they did absolutely nothing or made it worse. I am in therapy twice weekly and can barely even make a word out to my therapist because of my issues, so even then I end up just writing her a letter and watching her read it and attempting to communicate any further questions she has. I feel like an empty shell. A computer program simply meant to exist. I feel forgotten and it is no ones fault but my own, but I don't even understand why I have always done this to myself. nnI feel alone. I feel like cases this extreme do not exist. I literally daydream about being able to smile at a cashier and tell them to have a good day. I wish I could have friends that I can have lunch with and take cute pictures together. I wish I could go places with my boyfriend without fear of being looked at or needing to speak out loud. I wish I could post my vacation photos showing off my fitness progress in a cute bikini. nn**I wish the words I want to say would come out of my mouth the same way they do on paper.**"

I don't know if it's just extreme shyness or if it's social anxiety, I talked about it to my mom and I mentioned the fact that I wanted to see a therapist but she basically made fun of me and she said that it would be useless and that I should do more efforts. She said ""just talk to people, It's not that hard !"" But it's so hard for me. This was 1 year ago but nothing changed since then, and I'm scared to ask her again.nnI literally don't feel comfortable in front on anyone, even my closest friends, even my family sometimes, and I don't know if it's normal or not. I blush very easily. I feel so self-conscious in social situations that I always end up embarrassing myself. I almost never talk when I'm in a group and if I do I get ignored most of the time. When I'm nervous I get sweaty hands, and it's disgusting but once I even had  diarrhea because I was very nervous in a social situation, it was like 2 years ago but I still remember it, it made me so much more insecure and nervous because I didn't want it to happen again. And there's so many more examples, it's a long list and I'm too lazy to put everything here.nnSo, as I said I have no idea if I'm just very shy or if I have social anxiety. I would like to talk about it to someone but I don't feel legitimate because well, maybe I'm just being dramatic and I should do more efforts. Also, psychologists costs a lot and I don't want my parents to pay for me, I feel so guilty, they already pay me almost everything.nnI tried to go to these centers where you can see therapists, get abortions, get help with your social situation, etc... without telling my parents, but there were too many people on the waiting list and as I said, I don't feel legitimate at all, so I gave up. nnNow I'm stuck, I do want to get better, but I feel like I'm being dramatic and I feel guilty. I don't know what to do.nnSorry it's so messy, it's late and I'm tired, and sorry for the bad English, it's late, I'm tired, and it's not my first language, but thanks for reading !"

I can remember one very influential day at school which looking back was probably the catalyst for my anxiety. Basically I was reading through a book in front of my class and I choked up like a moron and sounded like a little girl trying to read for the first time. It was without doubt the most humiliating experience of my life, and I often wonder if I hadn’t gone in that day, my anxiety wouldn’t have even happened (butterfly effect I suppose). nnAnyways, after this complete embarrassment in front of my peers, I basically devolved and became a shell of my former self. I couldn’t ever read again in front of anyone else because I constantly think about messing up again, which would lead to all the standard anxiety symptoms (sweating, increased heart rate etc). Unfortunately it didn’t stop there; once I had convinced myself that I couldn’t even read in front of people, I began to think that if I couldn’t even achieve that, how would I ever be able to do most other things? How could I give presentations, give speeches, talk to people on the phone etc? My self esteem and confidence had pretty much hit rock bottom.nnFast forward to today and I’m 18 and more or less in the same spot. Some things I’ve been able to improve slightly but some things have gotten worse and somehow I know have developed this weird pattern of feeling sick every time I’m in a social situation I.e. in a restaurant, in a crowded house and so on. Overall it’s pretty humiliating but I really don’t know what I should do. I feel so pathetic for considering a therapist because I should be able to do all of these things myself. I’m also unsure how effective therapy would even be, although maybe medication prescribed by them may be beneficial.nnIf anyone has any advice on what could work to get rid of or at least reduce my anxiety, I’d really like to hear it because I’m out of options honestly. Also anyone who actually read all of that - I respect that."

To the outside world, I make myself appear as a happy, sociable, and relatable person. Always smiling, speaking with a friendly tone of voice, acting as interested as possible in everything anyone says and responding with what I think will make me seem like a chilled out guy. nnLittle do people know, this is all rehearsed, an act. I am constantly having to mask my inner depression &amp; anxiety so I don’t bring other people down or kill the vibes. It’s exhausting. I have perfected the art of appearing extroverted to strangers and acquaintances. I even managed to hold down a sales job for 6 months, making cold calls, having meetings with strangers etc but this ultimately lead to a breakdown and I quit. My family and a few close friends know of my mental struggles, but to most, I try and be as “normal” as possible. nnI try and avoid social situations, hate phone calls/public speaking, cancel dates last minute, stress over interactions I’ve had, and cringe at almost anything I have said to another human and how it might’ve made me look. Before any social interaction I’m so nervous that I cant eat and sometimes vomit, and I tend to drink excessively when socialising to numb the anxiety. Despite this, all my social interactions seem to go well but I feel like I’m not being my authentic self. (As my authentic self is a stressed out, paranoid, anxious over thinker who analyses everything way too much) Therefore, I struggle to make new friends, build and maintain a relationships with women, and spend a lot of time alone in my own thoughts. I forced myself on a tinder date for the first time in 2 years yesterday and even though she thought it went well, I was uncomfortable the whole time. I find it so hard to connect with new people as I’m just constantly in my own head. nnI have started to address these issues with therapy, which seems to help a bit, but I have a feeling that I am going to be wearing a mask my whole life. It’s an exhausting experience and not the life I had imagined for myself when I was younger. If anyone can relate to this, or have any tips on how to bridge the gap between my true self and who I present to the outside world, I would love to hear your advice, opinions or experiences. It’s nice to know you are not alone in these feelings. nn(Sorry for the long essay rant lol)"

I mean does it have such a big impact on our mental health and central nervous system? nnWhat I surely agree with is that a lot of smartphone usage and apps, social media etc fucks a lot in sense of dopamine, other neurotransmitters and overstimulating you. Another thing I could think about is that less smartphone time also means more time with yourself, anxiety, personality and causes of your depression. A bit like meditation, coming back to your true self. Also a bit like confrontation therapy as you have to deal more with your negative thoughts OR not being able to look on and get distracted by your phone means not having security and having to look up all the time (which is very hard for socially anxious people as you have more focus on the people around you).

On a drunk night out we got it off together and made out. I invited her back to mine, we where about to have sex when multiple of my friends arrive back at our flat. Me and the girl stop doing what we where doing and go to socialize. While socializing with my friends, someone hands the girl a weed brownie. She then gets violent high and starts being very sick. I continue to look after her all night helping her throw up and making sure she was okay. The next day she thanks me for looking after her and leaves. nnOur friends ended up going out again the next night and she was there again. The night started off with us hooking up again. I then leave the bar we where at to go check on a friend. When I was walking back to the bar, I saw her leave with another boy to go hook up. nnAfter seeing her switch to someone else so quickly, I was upset and annoyed. For the next few days of the trip whenever we saw each other, there where hash looks and even distasteful comments thrown. nnA few weeks after the trip our paths crossed again and we both apologised for the way we treated each other. nnWe didn't then see each other for a number of months. nnDuring this time, I became very distrustful of women. Partially cause of this girls actions, partially cause of a breakup I had a few months before this whole thing started. nnNow our paths are crossing again, as we both work on the same team.

How does your daily life look like? What does social anxiety do with you?n2. How did you cure (if cured) or how do you manage your social anxiety?nnI suffer from social anxiety and depression since I was 15 years old. Now I'm 21. I improved a bit in social skills, not very much but with time the depression symptoms became worse. For me social anxiety developped a severe depression with time. Why? Of course because it limits a normal life. How can you be happy without being able to socialize? How can you develop? How can you build an own personality? Human and interpersonal relationships are the most important thing in a human life. nnMy life and myself suffered very much having social anxiety. Isolation and losing self esteem more and more. Feelings of worthlessness and staying like this forever amplified. The depression started coming, symptoms like anhedonia, lethargy, dysphoria. Lack of interest, appetite, sexual drive, not being able to get stimulated from anything. My life and abilities (social, cognition, mood), everything went down to zero. I have many other posts about my issues so I don't want to go to much in depth as the topic should be more about the experience of you guys.nnHow I tried to manage it was **substances**. It seemed like I would be never able to enjoy life or socialize. Firstly **alcohol** was my godsent. Initially with 16 it was drinking only in the evening. Then after about a year I started drinking in the mornings keeping up the drunkness throughout the whole day. It helped so much with the psychological pain. I was able to go to social events, meet friends, visit school, do sports, be talkative and make jokes, be funny. I became dependent and a severe alcoholic. Everywhere I was, I was drunk. Self medicating with alcohol and being continiously drunk or half-drunk until I was 18. One day I lost my driving licence because of it. Then the next day I quit cold turkey and from then on I was never able to enjoy or feel positive effects of alcohol again. I built up a huge psychological apathy against alcohol. Maybe a blessing.nnThe second big substance was **phenibut**. What a great life I had on phenibut. It was amazing, the best part of my life ever, a good part of my life finally. But, naturally also phenibut lost it's magic, additionally to the fact that it was not bearable anymore for my body and mind. Also here I have many other posts about this and the problems the addiction and phenibut abuse gave me.nn**How am I able to live a normal life ever and sober?** My life is fucked. My personality is fucked. My cognition is fucked. I feel like a dead person in a vivid human body and mind. Buried alive, you could say. Psychological pain and hell on earth. It's horrible. No future perspective, many permanent negative thoughts that are always present and getting me down and horribly hurting pain, starting in the morning from the moment I open my eyes. Fuck, fuck, fuck.nnFrom the beginning it seemed as my psyche, central nervous system, brain, mind, genetics however you want to call it just weren't functional or able to live a normal life. I could never be normal, have a normal life, be a normal person. After so many years not being able to improve much, always getting back to deep negative holes with many problems after a little feeling of success reinforced this belief and my theory that **my neurological condition and structure is just not able to or allowing to have and experience a normal life. I can't do anything against it. I will never improve. Life will never improve.**nn**Other things I tried** to manage my social anxiety and depression:nnI had 2 **depth-psychological therapies**. None of them gave me relief or cure. No effects at all. I tried many **antidepressant and anxiety medications**: Venlafaxine (Effexor), Escitalopram (Cipralex), Sertraline (Zoloft), Seroquel (Quetiapine), Promethazine, Paroxetine (Paxil), Duloxetine (Cymbalta), Opipramol, Moclobemide, Bupropione (Wellbutrin). I also tried many **supplements** like Ashwagandha, Rhodiola Rosea, St. Johns Wort, Passion Flower, Magnesium, Uridine, Agmatine, Creatine, Vitamins, Zinc, Selen and so on. Also **nootropics** like Aniracetam, Alpha GPC, Phenylpiracetam, nicotine, caffeine. Again none of all these things worked for me or gave me relief or cure. I also tried **kratom** but it doesn't do much for me neither.nnWish you all the best, I really really wish everyone the best for their situations and lives.

My main concern is becoming more talkative and social as this would help my depression a lot. My psychiatrist and I even think that my depression had its origin in the social anxiety. Sure with all these consequences and restrictions caused by social anxiety depression is near by.nnI never look forward to social events, it's no fun for me, doesn't give me any joy or stimulation. I feel insecure, anxious and panicful. My head also feels empty as fuck all the time. I mean sure I have many negative thoughts but that's it. What I mean with empty is I can't find anything to talk or really think about. It seems as if I wouldn't have any access to my brain, my mind, my knowledge, my memories, my thoughts etc. I feel so dumb and retarded all the time. Like why can't I just think about things, be interested in them and then have the urge to express myself. But no there's no urge at all as well as no upcoming thoughts, topics, interesting ideas or so in my head neither. Emptiness describes it the best. I just want to be able to think about things, get interested in them, have an urge to express myself and have conversations with people. People and conversations could give so much and surely help with my depression if I just would be able to be more talkative and social.nnAnyone had the same experience and was able to change? For me it feels like I'm just biologically built like this. My central nervous system has probably always been like this, I even remember big paralleles to my childhood. I was quite, didn't have the urge to talk much and also spent a lot of time at home alone rather than having the urge to see my friends. Very strange and sad. How can someone like me (maybe it's really biologically/genetically determined) become more talkative, more social and socially secure? I also feel like I don't have much of a own personality or an own role. Makes sense when you think about me not being able to have access on my own thoughts etc or feeling stimulated or interested. Sure also depression and social anxiety and all its longlasting stress for years as well at its consequences it brings with for your personality, life and development or experience chances fucked me up too.nnThank you so much for your time if you read until here.

First being that I get anxious before hanging out with certain people. I have never had any problems with making friends therefore I'd say I have around 20-30 friends that I am comfortable with and do not get anxious about. I am friends with some of the more popular kids and would say that I am somewhat popular as well. But when one of my more popular friends asks me to go hangout with him and the more popular kids I get pretty anxious before hand. I really only get anxious when it's with those type of people. I am wondering if this is normal or if this is something more like SAD because I really am not sure.nnSecond question is about parties, like I said before I do not get anxious if the party is smaller and it's all people I am friends with or somewhat friends with but when it comes to people I don't know at all or it's the more popular kids, I get anxious. I am the type of kid at the party who either sticks around with the same group or the kid who is on their phone on the couch. I am in my final year of Highschool and all my peers and I are applying to university's and when talking to them about it they are all quite excited for the party aspect of it but I am not really. And I know some people might say ""if you get anxious about parties then don't go"" but then I also feel like I may be missing out. Wondering if this is normal.nnI can give some more information about me to see if this is normal or something like SAD. And also, **I am not asking for a diagnosis at all, just opinions.** I am an ambivert, can be an extrovert with the right people but an introvert with others. I do not have much anxiety when its talking to people like cashiers or waiter's etc. Not anxious when it's people I am familiar with."
6771,"_humanERROR_","post","Sudden physical symptoms of anxiety. What can I do about it?","I'm 20. Since I hit puberty I was always anxious and nervous around people. I would say my peak of anxiety was when I was 14. But now it's somehow getting worse with more physical symptoms.nnPerhaps the first time it happened was when I went on a school sleepover at 15. I got a horrible stomach ache that just wouldn't go away, and I had to go home. But the frustrating thing was that within half an hour of getting back home it disappeared. Maybe I was nervous because at the last sleepover I felt completely out of place and isolated while having to share my personal space with other people.nnI didn't get these stomach aches much for the next few years and couldn't connect them to anything particular.nnFast forward to 19/20, and some weird shit is happening.nnOn the first day of my new job in the summer. Over a period of an hour I got increasingly worsening cramps and nausea to the point where I had to excuse myself to the bathroom and leave my shift. I got even more nauseous in the care and when I got back home I vomited. My stomach ache stuck for the night. I didn't think much of it and thought it was food poisoning from a chicken pie I ate for breakfast that had been left out all night (in summer temperatures).nnBut then it happened again 2 weeks later on my job. It was an extremely stressful and fast-paced day. We were the busiest we'd ever been and I just wasn't coping. I was making too many mistakes and the managers were yelling at me. Again over an hour I developed bad cramping and nausea, and at the same time I excused myself and quit my job (the manager was glad). In the car I got even more nauseas. And I did not make it home. I vomited on the sidewalk. But about an hour after I came home everything levelled off and I felt fine.nnImportant to note that during that summer I was on birth control that was making me severely fatigued. So I stopped it and tried another one.nnSo for a couple of months I've been involved in a lot of projects and been meeting a lot of people. This is after being isolated for a whole year with my childhood friends slowly dropping over the years or disbanding due to fights. This really messed with my self-esteem where I thought I was just repulsive to people. So least to say I was pretty nervous every time I tried to talk to people.nnI'm getting anxiety symptoms with some friends but not others. It's those friends that my strict family would disapprove of. I really try to not be nervous. I really make an effort to look forward to the occasion. In my mind I'm thinking: ""I am ready to party, I am ready to have fun. I am having fun."" nnBut I can't help it that every single time I hang out with certain people, I shake the whole time. And then at some point, the stomach ache starts. It might decrease or increase randomly, it might get so bad to the point where I'm very uncomfortable. Nausea may start. I felt the threat of vomit when we took a taxi home one time. And it always disappears when I get back home.nnAnd then, this is when shit's becoming too much.nnI got it at my grandparents. My freakin' grandparents. I visit them only occasionally. I don't have a good relationship with them at all, it took a nosedive over the past 3 years, plus they're getting more fragile by the month. I had noticed some visits ago how it's odd that I'm getting tremors. But this time I got nauseas and had to leave. As usual, it passed in about an hour after coming back home.nnIt has to be anxiety. I don't think it's the birth control.nnI don't know what to do about it. In these situations my mind tells me I'm calm but my body says otherwise. nnI've been going to therapy on and off for the past 4 years. Many of the professionals weren't really good, but I've stuck with the same therapist for more than a year now. So I am getting therapy. nnI tried an anti-depressant and an anti-psychotic, and then in combination, for 6 months in total. And they did nothing. And I really don't want to go on medication because of their side-effects. I know 3 people who took anti-depressants/anti-anxiety medication and it completely wrecked them."

This isn’t me complaining because I know I’m not alone in this feeling. My days consist of virtual learning and listening to my teachers drone on. I remember my therapist would always tell me to do one thing each day to step outside of your comfort zone. It was very helpful and I started to do small things to break out of my shell, now with Covid there are few opportunities to really do anything. I need to be have more social interactions with people I’m not accustomed with, this will slowly but surely put my social anxiety to rest. I feel like a loser spending all this time at home, I’ve tried social media but it just never helps me because it all feels so fake. This lack of in person communication is getting to me, i feel like once quarantine is finally over, my social skills will be even worse. How have others overcome this feeling during Covid?"

Then come home and sulk all day in my sadness.nnI have absolutely no social skills. When co workers say hi to me at work ill say hi back most of the time. Might not be full volume all the time. But i try to get it out. But sometimes ill just straight walk right by them in silence. Like imagine that. Saying hi to someone and they completely ignore you. Im sure i come across cold and distant even when i do reply. Point is its not on purpose, its like my mind just starts freaking out. Like it just hit the pause button. Even if its as simple as good morning. I cant get my fucking lips and mind to sync. All i want is a girlfriend. I know there is lots of guys like that on here. But truly i just want someone i can confide in. I want to be able to tell someone I love them and hear it back. I just want someone to share this with. But how tf will that ever happen if i struggle to even say hi to some sweet old lady who always says hi  at work. Let alone someone im attracted to and afraid of them fucking hating me.nnI do have one co worker who i have come close to being friends with. But some where along our friendship i put up a wall. Why? Idk maybe im scared he will figure me out out for who i really am and hate me. Hes the kind of guy who trys to make people laugh or smile. Only reason we have connected is, ive basically been working with 5 days a week for like the last 8-9 to 9 months. Wasnt always this way. In the beginning i thought he was so fucking annoying. But eventually his persistance in trying to break me out of my shell worked. after a month or 2 of having to deal with eachother we clicked. But hes still just a co worker not a friend. Like why? Why tf did i put up a wall. Dude is 19, my age. Like if there was any good candidate to have a true friend in. Its him. But no. I fuck that up too.nnIts like my mind simply does not work like everyone elses.nnAre there any supplements that can help with social anxiety?

Over the time of doing a level 1, then 2 HSC course I learned to finally cope and now I am perfectly comfortable in a classroom. Now at 20 years old, I am finally on the level 3 course which I have wanted to study and worked towards since I started college at 16.nnOnline learning on zoom is due to start for us tomorrow and I can say with 100% certainty that I have experienced levels of stress and anxiety I have not felt since I was at school. This weekend I have hardly slept, threw up twice, then proceeded to break down crying over throwing up due to FUCKING ZOOM LESSONS. I am a 20 years-old ffs, I feel like I should be able to handle it better, but I just cannot help my feelings.nnLast year during the lockdown we didn't have ‘compulsory’ online lessons that affected attendance and my mental health actually increased.

I ended up finishing that course with a D* (only a level 2 but i was still really happy with myself)nnNow that we have to have online lessons as per timetabled lessons, I know I will be more stressed and less productive.

My teacher said I could keep my camera off, however, I still have to have my microphone on and answer the odd question every now and then so they know I am permanently at my desk interacting (college policies). I know he is really trying to help me but I am still feeling like I have described.nnI am worried when it comes to the lesson later I will ‘freeze’ and just won't be able to press the join button and he will think I am taking the piss.

At least this was the age when I really was conscious about my mental illness and it started to harm me. I already tried 2 depth-psychological therapies, right now I'm in a behavioral therapy. I also already tried 9 prescribed medications (SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs, neuroleptics) and right now I'm on amitritptyline (tricyclic antidepressant) 100mg at night. All of these things (talk therapy as well as meds) didn't have any effect for me at all. Except for side effects, escpecially sexual dysfunctions (inability to ejaculate).nnMy therapist and me came to the conclusion that a lot of my depression came from my Social Anxiety. Sure, makes sense if you think about the inhibitions and all the lost life experiences, fun, interpersonal relationships and personal development/growth due to Social Anxiety.nnMy main issues from Social Anxiety are: I just can't think of things to say. I don't even go to eat in my internship right now because I could meet people there in the cafeteria. I just can't open up, I can't be myself. I feel anxious and inhibited. My brain and mind feel dead, empty, inhibited and disabled. I feel like I don't have a real own personality. I feel so dumb because of my cognitive deficiency caused by anxiety and depression. Due to depression my mood, drive and cognition is very low and this only adds up to my social anxiety of course.nnWhat can I do? I'm 21 and I feel like my brain is just not able to develop or function. Also when I do a lot of social things and events for many days or weeks in a row I feel like I didn't learn any new patterns or behaviors. I'm stagnating. In any aspect: cognition, intelligence, knowledge, mood, socializing. It's a fucking vicious cycle.nnI think medication and drugs are the only thing that will work for me being able to live a normal and happy life. But I already tried so much. There still are loads of other meds and other groups like pregabalin, gabapentin, modafinil etc. And ketamine infusions, MDMA therapy, psiolcybin therapy, rTMS etc. up to come to Germany, I hope soon.nnLife is so hard and a torture every day not being able to learn and improve social skills, cognitive functionality, good or at least a stable mood, knowledge and intelligence.

Especially if the teacher reads mine aloud.nnSo I don’t write anything during the time class is in session and try to do it after class when I’m absolutely sure no one else is on it anymore. But no, THERE’S ALWAYS SOMEONE THERE. It’s worse if it’s the teacher. And they can see the moment you joined. I get embarrassed and just close the tab right away. So if I have to do it, I do it at like 1 am because there’s no way anyone will be on it then, right?

Now I'm 21. It first started with social anxiety, I'd say, then because of the issues the social anxiety gives the depression came and then complete anhedonia, lack of drive, appetite and huge cognitive deficiency making me feel dumb and retarded, mentally as well as physiologically, right now.nnAnd I don't know how to change it, I tried a lot like 10 medications (SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs) and right now on a tricyclic antidepressant called Amitriptyline. I also tried socializing weeks daily but it seems that my brain never gets an aha-effect or wow, this it how it works, my brain just doesn't learn any new patterns or cognitions (according socializing, university, knowledge etc. etc.). I also tried 2x depth psychological therapy and right now I'm in a  behavioral therapy.nnThe Amitriptyline doesn't work neither. It was my first antidepressant after more than 9 months now, I started it on 20th of December 2020. But I also started abusing Kratom daily since October 2020 and Phenibut since 3 weeks daily now as without it I wouldn't be able to function in the traineeship for my university which I am in right now. I start thinking about maybe those are the reasons I don't get effects from the Amitriptyline. Also regarding the antidepressants I tried before I always was abusing alcohol at first, then some years later phenibut and now kratom daily. The first 4 antidepressants I had I didn't use any substance at all (not even alcohol/nicotine) but I also didn't get any effects. nnAll is fucked up: my brain chemistry my thinking my body. I feel retarded and dumb, mentally as well as physiologically. I don't know what to say in social events, I can't open up myself and feel free or be myself. I can't keep or learn new knowledge, I can't focus at all in conversations as well as classes in university. I can't study. I can't stand up in the morning. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I can't make any new friends or make romantic relationships even if all the people I know tell me I'm so good looking but this doesn't touch my self esteem at all. My self esteem, -trust and -value are at zero. I can't find any clear or rational thoughts but countless incredibly painful negative thoughts. And I fuck myself with kratom, phenibut and cigarettes (at least 0.0 alcohol since 2 years and no other drugs). My head and mind feel empty but at the same time over all the place. My hope is getting less and less since I'm fighting since I was 15. I know the reasons due to my depth psychological therapy so this is understood but still nothing changes.nnAny suggestions or recommendations for me?nnI will continue my behavioral therapy even if never go out with it with knowing something new that helps me. According meds I still have perspective as I think my brain chemistry is so fucked up because of all this years living and thinking like this because of depression and social anxiety. I also know that my depression fucked up my cognition so bad. I already tried: Venlafaxine (Effexor, Trevilor), Escitalopram (Cipralex), Seroquel (Quetiapine), Promethazine =&gt; those were the meds I tried without abusing any substance meanwhile. On daily alcohol abuse starting in the morning: Sertraline (Zoloft), Paroxetine (Paxil) =&gt; then slowly drifted to phenibut meanwhile on: still Paroxetine (Paxil), Duloxetine (Cymbalta), Opipramol, Moclobemide (Aurorix, an MAOI) =&gt; now on 4 months Kratom and 3 weeks of phenibut daily: Amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant).nnI also heard about amisulpride helping tons with social anxiety (which was the main source of my depression early in the beginning and it would help me tons with my depression if I didn't have social anxiety). My doc also mentioned pregabalin (Lyrica) and gabapentin at some of the last options but I know those are very addictive.nnWhat other meds could I give a try the next time I'm at my doc? I also (naturally) want to quit phenibut and kratom after my traineeship ends in 2 weeks. I just need it for this time somehow. Phenibut I don't take at the weekends, only kratom. So is there any med that would help me with withdrawal and detox at the same time while improving my mood, drive, cognition and helping me with depression?nnWhat is your opinion? Did most of these meds didn't work because of my abuse of other substances at the same time? Otherwise also the first 4 meds I tried didn't have any effect and I wasn't using any other substance than the antidepressant. I feel very bad about thinking this now, of course. My own fault but I just wanted to live at least 20% rather than 0% and these substances allowed me to do so.nnI thank you for reading so far! I appreciate very help so so much and give you a big hug!

Have any of you tried that?","I heard from a few therapists that it might be a good idea for me to get myself some social media accounts like twitter, instagram etc. because my social anxiety is just as bad, if not worse, online. I don't understand how people can post selfies online or overshare without feeling paranoid. It could be a good way to talk to people but at the same time, i don't know if that's worth it. A quick look at twitter and all i see are people fighting and cancelling others for the dumbest reasons imaginable. It's like they hate anyone for the sake of hating. I'd feel paranoid about saying anything at all and having my account hacked. If i ever create an account there i'd probably stay on the ""safe"" side of the website (""booktwitter"" seems chill enough). I've also heard about this Discord thing (apparently an app where you can talk to other people about topics you have in common? I still have to look it up lol) Anyway, i just wanna know if any of you tried that and how it played out, or if any of you are thinking about doing the same as well."

Every class I go into, it's either i HAVE to answer a question that just results in me having an anxiety attack and going home, or I have to go up to present, which again, you guessed it, results in me having an anxiety attack and going home. My friends just tell me, ""Nah, your just shy!"" Wow really, any person who was JUST shy doesn't have trouble breathing and starts shaking when there teacher tells them good morning. I can't even do group projects without shaking and crying. I go to the nurse just about everyday, just to be sent back and forth until they send me home. A month ago my parents sent my teacher a heads up about it, my teachers COMPLETELY disregard it. It's gotten so bad. Here's a true story, one time like a few years ago in 5th grade, I had to go up to the board and find where a fraction was on a fraction line. I went up there, and the teacher said, ""Okay Isabelle, while doing this explain to the class how you are doing it."" I IMMEDIATELY froze. I knew the material, I knew EXACTLY what to do, say, and think. But nothing came out, I just started crying and shaking, and before I knew it I fell unconscious. You know what my teacher THOUGHT it was? I got sick. I had to somehow explain to her without crying again that I have social issues. Point is, I can't do ANYTHING without breaking down, crying, hyperventilating, shaking, and sometimes fainting. I've tried medicine, therapy, nothing's worked. And I've posted about this before on a discord server for mental issues, they all sent me positive messages and ways to help it, don't get me wrong I appreciated this so much, but nothing worked. I practiced convos in the mirror, breathed before going into class, getting more sleep, nothing. I need to fix this, because its so horrible."

I started getting therapy a year ago—my senior year of high school—and I initially saw lots of improvement. I was hoping to see a psychiatrist about getting medicated but my therapist wanted me try other things first so over the past year I have practiced mindfulness techniques and other ways of dealing with social anxiety. nnThese methods definitely helped and I am able to step outside of my comfort zone much more easily now. However I still cannot get rid of the constant thoughts swirling around my head and simple interactions like calling a restaurant to place an order sometimes give me so much anxiety I feel physically ill.

I have zero social skills. I can't talk or connect with anyone; everyone thinks I'm weird. I thought all this was because I didn't know much so I started reading, watching movies and documentaries, playing video games and took up many other hobbies. Alas, I didn't improve one bit. In  high school I had a few friends. I moved to college and didn't make a single friend. I then changed colleges and moved to a new country. Stupid decision since I couldn't even make friends in my own country. Here, my anxiety has only increased. The thing is, I've never partied, had alcohol, had sex, had a partner, haven't even had a female friend. I get nervous around people, especially women that I'm attracted to. Today, my floormate offered to have me meet with his friends. My stupid ass said ok and when the time came I pretended I was asleep. They thought I was not in my room. I overheard those guys say how weird I was and all and it's absolutely broken me. I tried to be as nice as possible to him. Those guys were even making fun of me when I'd woken up and thought I could hear them. Whatever the case this isn't the first time such a thing has happened to me. My depression is over the roof right now. I literally want to kill myself. Why am I like this? What did I do to deserve this? Perhaps it is my fault. Maybe I shouldn't be a creep. I'm a grown ass man and I'm in tears right now. I've never been popular with girls, they've always thought Im a creep. Never been popular with the guys, they've always treated me like a weirdo. Perhaps it's all in my mind. I don't care at this point. I don't think I'll ever make friends. I think I'll never find a date. I spend my whole day laying in my room too scared to go outside or even ask my suitemate for anything. He is a social butterfly. Lucky him. Perhaps therapy will work. If it doesn't I don't think I'll carry the will to live any longer. I have such big plans for my future. I want to be a public speaker. The worst profession I could've wanted for myself given my current situation. Anyways, to anyone else struggling with anxiety, perhaps my condition gives you hope, or despair, I don't even care anymore. No one understands me. Not even my parents. I guess I truly am alone."

Heads up, I have an official diagnosis for SA.nnI'm a teacher ironically. I do great at my job (though it's exhausting emotionally because I'm also an introvert) and I do a great job at parent teacher conferences. I'm weirdly good at speaking with strangers and even telling strangers off. I will be shitting bricks the whole time but if someone cuts the line in front of me or something, I will tell them to piss off.nnMy social anxiety manifests in everyday relationships and conversations, even with people I am close to. My mind goes blank completely. It's like that period of development where children develop basic ass social skills never happened. The first time I meet someone things are fine , but the next time I have to see them, it's literally like ""okay what else is there to talk about how do I talk to people, what do people talk about and how do they do it so effortlessly!"" and so I freak out and flake. The times where I don't flake I end up regretting coming. I am friendless because of this. People think I have no personality because of this. It's extremely isolating. At work I eat alone in my car because the idea of sitting in a lounge and ""chit-chatting"" makes me want to kill myself.

6819,"georgehar20","post","Challenging my social anxiety and making progress","I (23 m)have only recently recognised that the issues I’ve been having socially can be attributed to an actual disorder “social anxiety” I am now seeing a therapist and working hard to reframe my thought processes. It’s my first post on here and I’m making it purely because I have no one else to speak to about this so it feels good to get it off my chest.nnMy social anxiety is mainly triggered when in the company of the opposite sex especially with potential romantic partners. In these situations I find myself unable to express myself, always questioning what to say, always questioning how I’m coming across, always feeling like some sort of performer that has to be amazing and funny at all times to get them to like me. This anxiety makes it very hard to be my authentic self and makes it really difficult to connect to others. I’ve been working so hard to change my mindsets lately and speak to them the same way I would my guy friends.nToday before seeing a girl I’m speaking to I meditated and listened to some relaxing music and got myself into the following mindset:nn-do not care what she thinks of you , just be yourself and if she likes you for you then she’s worth investing in.n- try to be in the present, don’t overthink what to say just say what comes to your head and go from there nnThese two things are usually impossible for me to do and I’m sure many of the people on here know that as that’s part of the main problem with social anxiety. Somehow I managed to pull it off and things went amazing with this girl and felt so natural and I had such a good time and was so happy I was being myself. The issue for me now will be to keep this going, the moment she left I was already anxious about what I was going to text her about later on when she got home and if our text conversation would bore her. But hey I’m happy with the success of today and it’s incredible how much of a difference small mindset changes can make and just hope I can keep battling this awful condition to keep these mindsets and be able to relax in her company.nI wish everyone on here success with their own challenges with social anxiety and my messages are always open if anyone wants to chat and share ways they are coping and tackling this."
6820,"Gottchen","post","What was your way of becoming more social, talkative and able to open up and just be yourself?","Hello I‘m suffering from severe depression and social anxiety since I was 15 years old, now I‘m 21.nnI already did 2 depth-psychological therapies and am in a behavioral therapy right now. I already tried countless medications: Venlafaxine (Trevilor), Sertraline (Zoloft), Escitalopram (Cipralex), Seroquel (Quetiapine), Promethazin, Paroxetin (Paxil), Wellbutrin (Bupropion) Duloxetine (Cymbalta), Opipramol, Moclobemide and am on Amitriptyline 100mg at night now. Of all meds I reached the highest dose possible and none gave me any effects. I think the amitriptyline has a very little impact on my depression and keeps me from falling into the deepest depression. Additionally it helps me with my sleep but does nothing regarding my social anxiety. nnRight now I‘m a dumbo and abusing phenibut and kratom daily (which also are very subtle to me) as I‘m in an internship which is a must-do for my bachelor degree and without phenibut and kratom I wouldn‘t have done it, came so far or being able to the intern tasks I do here. It‘s still one week to go, after that I‘m going to quit phenibut and kratom and 100% experience withdrawal which will give me deep depression and anxiety again, I‘m sure.nnWell I wrote so much about my trials forgetting to mention the point of this post. Social anxiety was and still is the main source of my depression. nnMy symptoms are mainly anhedonia (lack of interest, nothing that stimulates me or makes me fun); deep psychologically extremely hurting negative thoughts and feelings of emptiness and that I have failed life and will fail from the moment I open my eyes in the morning; cognitive deficiency (caused by yearlong depression); social anxiety and all its symptoms and restrictions to life (a big problem for me is that I never am able to think about anything to talk about, my head just feels empty and inhibited, as if I had no knowledge, memory or experiences at all); then also psychosomatic pain especially in my back, neck, shoulders. Even walking a bit or just standing, keeping body posture, sitting or walking stairs are incredibly exhausting for me. Social anxiety hinders me to build relationships (friends/romantic), open up or be myself and going out, in short it hinders me from experiencing life and developing. For example I hide in my room when I hear that my roommates are in the kitchen (even if I really have to pee or I‘m hungry as fuck). If friends ask me to do something I always invent excuses because my anxiety and panic grows big. If I‘m walking in the city or somewhere and I see someone in 100 or even more meters coming the same direction to me I’m like paralyzed and thinking about how to act for this one second he will be near by me. Like holy shit crazy unnecessary stuff I can’t control. I think that everyone observes and criticizes me, doesn’t like me, just waits for me doing something wrong and so on and so on. Irrational and exhausting things like that which continuously add up to my low self esteem of course.nnAnd what is a life without humans and social life, without being able to build up real relationships or feel interests, passion or fun. I feel like I don’t have a own personality. I feel like I don’t even know myself. I feel like my future has nothing to give. Life feels like living in a dead body for me. I feel alone, a painful emptiness and as if I have nothing to offer and no worth or skills, nothing. nnHow should I even have developed myself or skills not taking part in life because my socially anxious brain hinders me from living, experiencing and by it: developing. It takes me all my self esteem and lust for life being like this. Just because of social anxiety. In short feel like a dumb, mentally and physically retarded, incompetent, always bad mood, antisocial and worthless washout. nnSo my question to you, how to continue? How should I ever be able to work a real job like this (depressive, socially anxious and „dumb“), build up true relationships and have true friends and true girlfriends? (With true I mean relationships that I build up because I really wanted, relationships in which I can be myself, have fun and especially finally be able to open up.) How should I some day be a father of a family, feel fun, interest and passion, enjoy life and get through all the challenges and so called „life tasks“ that life will bring?nnAbout my resources:nI‘m 21, in college, no future perspectives because of what I wrote about. I don‘t see myself functioning anywhere...n1. At least I was able to almost get through my bachelor somehow, am in 5th from 6 semester now (even if I took one year break in between). I don’t know where to go or what to do after my bachelor.n2. I have friends and family. But I can‘t be myself, open up or feel fun, even at my closest family members or friends. It all feels so untrue for me. As I said I feel like I don‘t have any personality. Everything feels so unreal, daunting, horrible and painful or just boring. n3. My physical appearance is no problem to me, without wanting to sound narcissistic I really am a pretty motherfucker (I get this told a lot lot). But this doesn‘t mean anything to me, it has no value, it doesn‘t give me any self esteem at all. I‘m still a mental wrack and slouch. I still feel as if really anybody else is 2000% better than me.n4. I had girlfriends and sex. I’m mentioning this because it was something that really helped me a bit as if I kind of checked this life task off like: Job done!n5. I am really anhedonic but still I produce digital music for Spotify sometimes and people seem to like and support it.n6. Im interested in neurosciences but it’s nothing I could make money with.n7. If you would ask me about my hobbies I would say tennis and skiing.n„Hey see you have interests then“ yes but this is on a very anhedonic way. It still all feels so painfully empty and I’m just not able to feel/get stimulated by any of those things. But I can say that tennis and skiing help me with my negative thoughts for a moment.n7. We aren‘t rich (my parents are divorced btw) but I would say we don‘t have any financial issues.nnThank you so so much if you read until here. I could write on and on. Like how my childhood was, what I have experienced etc etc. but yeah I tried to write down the most important things which could be useful for anyone trying to help. If you need any further information please just leave a comment and ask me anything you want!nnWhat are your suggestions for me?nnIf you suffered from social anxiety too:nWhat was your way of losing this horrible disease? Or more: What was your way of becoming more social and talkative, being able to open up and just be yourself. I really just want to be able to talk and talk and talk, have fun socializing, open up to other people and just be myself. Right now it seems like I‘m faking 100% the whole time and that‘s so exhausting and feeling wrong and bad.nnMy therapy as well as I think social anxiety is really the biggest source of my depression as it hinders me from having social boundaries (which is really important for the human species), living life, going out and just experience things to be able to develop and grow in personality and knowledge. I feel like I kind of stagnated since I was 15 and started to become capable of perceiving my social anxiety and it‘s restriction =&gt; so: of course depression, a very low self esteem and restricted not enjoyable life."

I'm a 17 years-old teenager that feels discouraged and frustrated with herself and others but let me explain why: for all of my high school years I've had difficulties trying to be comfortable and fully at ease with my other classmates. I guess that from the beginning I had  strong fear and urge to make new friends so I tried to be as friendly as possible and tried really hard to ""fit in"", but I also had the feeling that those new people weren't really my type. The point is that it has been four years and I still am so far from feeling good with them. In October I discovered I have social anxiety and also a problem with overthinking everything so since then I tried CBT (*Cognitive behavioural therapy)*  and at first I guess I was becoming more confident but, after a few months, me and my therapist stopped talking about it as if the problem was ""solved"" or something. So now I'm here feeling very discouraged because every day at school it's the same, I always feel so ""contained"" if that makes sense and I never have one moment where I just talk whithout thinking about how boring I am, how cringe I might seem, if the thing I want to say will be stupid and boring. I just want to feel myself around others but that seems so impossible at this point. I don't know if my classmates were different, I then wouldn't have fallen so deep into this problem, but they aren't mean or anything and that is what really confuses me. I would like to know if there's any of you who had or has a similar situation as me and maybe if you have any suggestion. Is there a light at the end of the tunnel?"

Even when sitting with childhood friends in a restaurant, I feel more anxious than I would like to be.nnDoing **anything** alone like grocery shopping or using public transport is even worse as I  feel extremely anxious and worried what people think.

It's been going better, although any experience that involves doing things in public alone terrifies me. Obviously with the lockdown right now, I cannot do a lot of things.nnWhat I'm wondering is whether what I have is even Social Anxiety (I have an official diagnosis of it after lengthy interviews with a psychiatrist and many therapists made the same conclusion) or if this is just a normal experience for everyone?nnAre most people terrified whenever they are doing things without friends and am I perhaps focusing on the wrong things in exposure therapy , is it even normal to do things alone?nnI want to feel as a confident as a 24 year old and be able to just lead at least a normal confident city life, without feeling super insecure or anxious every time my friends are not present?nnMy brother on the other hand seems able to look always look confident wherever he goes, despite being an introvert.

I feel nervous sitting in class, I lie and say my camera is broken so I don’t have to turn it on during google meets, and the other day my best friend at school sat with someone else(we only have two seats per table because of covid measures) and he let me know he was doing it and the kid he sat with sits alone normally so I couldn’t be that mad at him, but that’s not the point. I sat there feeling anxious the whole time, I felt like the whole lunch room was judging me. It was on this day it was like a switch flipped and something in me told me this wasn’t normal. One day I was scrolling through my phone when I decided to look up why I was so anxious to turn my camera on during meets and came across what we know as social anxiety. I took 3 tests online, all saying I had it or likely had it. I looked up symptoms and most seemed to match.

Need tips and perspective. Thank you!nnOkay, I’m posting again. My apologies. I am just having a rough few days. I have moderate social anxiety that has been leaning towards severe the past few days and social cues have been incredibly incomprehensible for me. I am hoping for kind folks here to help me see things objectively.nnSo, I posted that there has been a texting mishap with my new SO two days ago and we sorted it out. I was still feeling anxious for some reason but I tend to find a new thing to be anxious about every time so I figured this is just a case of it.nnI decided to ask him out to a cute date tomorrow. I asked him if he wanted to go ice skating with me again or build a blanket fort, and he said he wanted to do both. He seemed excited. But I found out from his Facebook page around 8 pm (he knows I follow his professional page - he’s dabbling into broadcasting) that he’s on air tomorrow evening/night. nnI have always been super supportive of his hobby and am a fan of his broadcasts! It is just I thought we were spending the night together because that’s what we always do and he didn’t even let me know he’s planning to work the night until around midnight! He asked if we can meet early afternoon. I am quite irritated on top of anxious by then but tried to stay calm and told him it’s okay but I thought he was doing his thing in the afternoons as usual. And he told me he’s still trying to figure out what the “usual” is. nnI always look forward to our weekends and I think he does as well - but this response didn’t sit well with me. Granted, I like planning things way ahead because having things planned out gives me some sort of calmness. He can also be an anxious person but he is extremely spontaneous and plans things last minute. We both learned to compromise and he usually confirms plans at the end of work day on Fridays (we verbalize that we will see each other next weekend at the end of each date). I’ve just been almost feeling angry since midnight and it’s 2 am now. This is an angry kind of anxiety I’m feeling is for the first time in three months I’ve been with him, I’m actually mad at him. My body is trying to push me into the fight or flight mode but because I have BPD along with anxiety, I learned in group therapy that this might be a false alarm for folks like me. Not sure how to identify what I’m feeling is valid or reasonable and how to process this new type of irritated/angry kind of anxiety. Some perspective and tips will be much appreciated.

Summer 2021 I applied at 2 places and only got 1 interview but no call backs and the interview went quite well. The rejections are not what I'm afraid of Its the actually getting the job part and having to start new and be the newbie who doesn't know anything and obviously I'm a teenager so most the jobs avaliable all have to do with working in the public which also scares me. The reason I quit my first job is cuz I kept messing up and the anxiety became too much and i just stopped showing up. I was even too scared to formally quit.nnI also hate being the one needed to provide for in my group. Both my close friends at one point have had to provide for our group.

I had a few friends and an almost normal social life but over the years my avoidance behaviors and irritability ruined all those relationships. I’ve been making very slow progress over the last few years. I dropped out of high school but managed to get my GED. And now I can order my own food at a restaurant and talk to shop staff with much more ease. But COVID made it really easy to hunker down and stick to myself again...... I spent a year doing nothing basically and I feel really bad about it. Plus I have all the time in the world to ruminate about my past failures. Sometimes I catch myself regretting not doing things I never cared about doing in the first place, like going to a high school prom. Most of my social interaction is online now but sometimes talking to people makes me feel worst, because I have less “normal” life experiences to talk about. Lately I’ve been really wanting to go out alone just to see if I can handle it, but there isn’t any place to go.

As a child, I always watched the other children being and playing together while I stood by the side and felt jealous. My self esteem was very fragile, and my self confidence practically did not exist. I knew as a child that I would regret not doing more, not taking some kind of initiative. But I also thought ""Hey, I have tomorrow. Today I am just gonna endure, but tomorrow I'll do something about it"". Tomorrow became next week, and next week became next month. Next month became next year, and next year became next decade.nnAnd here I am. At 17 years old, having wasted more than a decade on...nnNothing.nnI never got to play football with the other kids, never got to play videogames with them, never got to play in the fields with them, never went to the beach with them, never got to feel like I belonged. Never truly got to feel that I lived.nnVideo games and playing in the fields got replaced by parties and hanging out. When I went home from school, I would spend my afternoons and evenings at home with my family or alone, while my peers would go to each other's places and having a good time together. Often they would go to parties with each other, being immature, exploring their sexualities and in general just having the times of their lives. Meanwhile I'd sit indoors at home, doing nothing, and even feeling sorry for myself.nnNow I've reached a certain age, where I have concluded that there is no tomorrow. We never live tomorrow. We always live today. I have always consciously known this, I just never haven't done anything about it, because unconsciously I'd always think ""Well, there IS tomorrow"". But no, there isn't. Only today is. Only NOW is. I know you've been told this a thousand times, but it is true. Don't wait understanding it till it's too late.nnI will never be able to do the things I was so jealous of in my childhood. Never, EVER. It's gone.nnI know. I'm only 17, so I have all of life ahead of me, so I can't complain. But no, if I continue thinking ""But I still have tomorrow"", tomorrow will become next week, next week will be next month, next month will be next year, next year will be next decade, and BAM, next decade will be in death.nnSo do something about it NOW!! Contact a therapist if you haven't already. And I mean, really, DO IT! nnOne day you'll wake up wrinkled, weak and tired. That day will be very soon, trust me.nnImagine this:nnYou are 73 years old. You have no friends or family. But wrinkles you got a lot of. You look at yourself in the mirror and think ""Where did all these years go?"". Well, you wasted them on thinking that you always had tomorrow. You think back on those times when you were just a teenager. Ah, being a teenager. Being around with friends and living life. But you never got to do that, because you always had tomorrow. Then you think about your twenties. Ah, the twenties. The time of exploring the world and yourself. But you never did that, because you always had tomorrow. Then you reminisce your thirties. Ah, the thirties and forties. Getting a family and enjoying life. But you never did that, because you always had tomorrow. Then your fifties and sixties, the time of relaxing and enjoying life with your family and friends. But you never did that, because you always had tomorrow. And here you are at 73. Thinking about the past and what you could have done. Ah, what could have been. You will be entering your grave with the memories of a lost life. A life without life. Because you never truly lived.nnBut then!nnA fairy comes and gives you the most precious gift of them all; the opportunity to return back time! You get the chance to relive your life! nnWhat would you do different this time? Would you still just say ""But I still have tomorrow""?nnI hope that you not just got my point, but also that you would start doing something with your life, and that you won't let your social anxiety ruin the most precious thing you have.

I'm also easily irritated when people I love (such as girlfriend, friends, parents, sisters) ask me something.nnAside from that I also think I'm suffering from quite severe social phobia. I have a slight stutter that over the past months has transformed into a quite severe stutter, which I blame as both cause and result of this social anxiety. Online classes have become a nightmare because once I have to start talking the anxiety takes total control of my body. Also I've lost a complete will to even meet friends. I always used to be quite socially 'attentive' (cuz of my stutter), but something like this I've never experienced. I'm pretty much anxious 24/7 cuz I became so extremely afraid of having to do presentations, or just speaking to people I dont know, etc nnMy GP has given me a Beck Depression Inventory questionnaire that she wants me to fill in by friday (when I have the next appointment to see if I need more specialised help or so). I just got a score of 22, which (according to dr. internet) coincides with a mild/moderate depression. nnSo are there people here who just like me seemed to suffer from both depression and social anxiety (and most ideally with a stutter) and were treated succesfully (by medication)?   nA friend of mine who studies medicine said paroxetine would probably my best bet, so I'm certainly gonna bring that up.   nAt the moment I'm not interested in psychotherapy, but certainly considering it at a later moment (if medication should not help enough).nnThank you"

Then I never touched it again. I abused phenibut high doses daily for the third time now.

My cognition is better, I feel very clearheaded and focussed now. Much better memory. I didn‘t feel like this since ages. I don‘t feel depressed anymore. Social anxiety? Well social anxiety is still present, but I‘m just perfectly fine with it and being myself just as I am. Through this I suddenly found myself being much more relaxed and social at work, in the city or with friends. So being confident with being myself and accepting social anxiety as a part of mine suddenly reduced my social anxiety.nnI would describe the effects as if everything is just perfectly right where it is right now. Total calmness and inner peace. I finally feel normal.nnP.S. The greatest effect and positive changes occured after adding methylfolate to my stack but I won‘t tell you that it was methylfolate only as it could have also been the other supplements in my stack starting to show effects after taking them regularly for some time. Either way taking any of these supplements can‘t harm you but just do good for your body, brain and mind.

First job I got was as a substitute teacher at several schools in my area, but for kids from 1-6 years. It went okay most of the time, although there were certain moments that made me feel so anxious, for instance:nn* In certain situations I freaked out on the inside because I didn't know what to do. Like, when a kid was doing something they weren't allowed to do like banging on the table and singing really loud or running around instead of tidying the room, and they didn't listen to me. Being strict was something I struggled with. I guess it's difficult for me to raise my voice (I'm not meant to scream at them of course, just sound *serious*) and call out the kids. In* I often feared that I was being watched and judged by the teachers, even though they probably were busy taking care of the kids and didn't think of me that much. I imagined that they were thinking things like ""this substitute teacher sucks, she can't do anything right and is so weird, she's disturbing us/is in the way more than she's being helpful"" etc. n* When there were other subs there, I often compared myself and thought things such as ""they're so much better at talking with the kids than me"" and ""I would never have thought of saying/doing that, maybe I'm just not right for the job. nnI worked there a couple times a week for a while until the pandemic started and the substitute supply decreased drastically. I found another job, but unfortunately it was temporary and ended a couple months ago.nnI live at home, so I'm not as stressed as getting a job as I would if I had moved out. But I still need to make and save money, but I've been applying for job after job and I keep getting rejected. The pandemic doesn't make it easier.nnI haven't worked at the kindergarten for almost a year, but I'm ""still in the system"" and technically, I could start working there this week if I wanted to. I'm really considering it, but the problem is my anxiety. Not only for the reasons I stated earlier, but also because it has happened 2 times or so that I felt so anxious that I cried and called in sick. Two weeks ago I got an offer to work for a day, I said yes and felt nervous but okay about it, until the night when I woke up twice from anxiety. The following morning they called from the school and said that they had to close down due to a covid outbreak, and I was honestly so relieved that I didn't have to go.nnAs you can see, I feel very anxious about it, but at the same time it feels like it may be my only chance to having a job in the near future. What would y'all do? Should I just ""suck it up"" and force myself to go through it even though it means I will be waking up from anxiety for a while and hope that I will get used to it, or do I just keep looking for other jobs even though I may stay unemployed for months???"

Probably tried almost 20 different medications, SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs, anti-psychotics (history of manic depression), beta blockers, and unfortunately, benzodiazepines. nI've ODed in my teens multiple times due to this. And have been hospitalized as well. Mostly due to benzodiazepine usage. nnAnyhow. I am currently weaning off of 6mg of Clonazepam, now at 2mg daily, given certain good opportunities from this dreadful pandemic, and seem to be making progress. Of course I'm running into all the beautiful withdrawal symptoms. No surprises. However there's this one particular symptom which maybe someone can help me understand?nI'm a guitarist, it's what I am absorbed in 24/7. It keeps me sane. I've performed before many times live without too many issues (usually relied on benzos or slight alcohol), but with the same nagging symptom which scares me beyond any. nnWhenever I am in front of a camera, or lets say, an audience that I'm obviously not familiar with (this doesn't happen with close friends), my adrenalin rushes throughout my body and my fingers become heavy and shaky and sweaty and it's much harder to do what I love to do. My skills are brought down 60%, or more. nThis adrenalin rush from anxiety isn't weird or rare, I've had it with panic attacks around age 13, but it never persisted like this. nI become paralyzed almost and no matter how many hours I put into playing while recording (mostly visually, audio I can manage alone fine) there's no way around it. This also transfers to when I'm performing. That's not happening anytime though.nnNow, I'm not a person who would trade this for that but I would honestly deal with any physical or mental pain than to have the only thing I love doing stripped from me. My best bet would be a beta blocker? Something to curb adrenalin? I can't see drugs as an option but if it's last resort, who knows. Who knows.nnnCheers if you read this long.nMuch love."

My trainer used to be with me all the time. In the training they taught us that 8 out of 10 will reject you rudely and its okay.nIt happened 3-4 times when I went blank while delivering my pitches. But my trainer was supportive.nI kept on doing it and eventually I was able to deliver full pitch without fumbling.nnThen the next issue was handling rejection. Some of them used to be very rude. Ofc I was hurt by all this. But my trainer told me a thing, that when someone is being rude to you it shows their character not yours. You will find such people in every aspect of your life. You should learn to ignore them. You should say thank you to people even if they abuse you. nI really liked this point. You know what?

The social anxiety is the biggest source of my depression and low self-esteem. It‘s the one big issue in my life with all it‘s countless restrictions which lead to not being able to do anything and never get moments of success =&gt; back at low self-esteem =&gt; depression =&gt; social anxiety. A vicious cycle. nnMY TREATMENT:nI had 2 depth-psychological therapies already without any success. I mean it was cool to have someone to talk about my issues but right after I left the clinic I was back in reality. No aha-moments, no feelings of new breakthroughs and learned something new important to realistically change in my behavior. Right now I‘m in a behavioral therapy.nI also tried about 8 antidepressants prescribed by various docs: SSRI/SNRIs (Venlafaxine, Cipralex, Zoloft, Paroxetine, Cymbalta), Opioramol, Neuroleptics (Quetiapine, Promethazine), s MAOI (moclobemide) and right now I‘m on a tricyclic called Amitriptyline. All these meds had zero effect on me except for sexual side effects but they didn‘t give me any significant or noticeable relief of my symptoms and especially my social anxiety.nnI don‘t know the exact aim of me posting this here but I just hope to find some people/sufferers like me with similar symptoms and history of medication or talk therapy.nnI know that there are still hundreds of more different substances or prescription meds and pharmaceuticals that could potentially help „treatment-resistant“ persons like me and finally give a significant relief and reduction of symptoms to finally be able to live a life. I can‘t enjoy 99% of my days. It‘s horrible. I wouldn‘t ever harm myself but I‘m still young and don‘t want to suffer longer and longer.nnMaybe someone here has some advice regarding alternatives (especially medications) for the issue I have with the social anxiety restricting my whole life, personal development and pleasure. nnI appreciate every little info, help, suggestion or assumption. Let me know about your symptoms, your medication and what helped/what didn‘t.nnWhat other meds have some great potential for social anxiety sufferers who don‘t respond to the usual antidepressant as SSRIs/SNRIs?nnThank you for reading! Below I just summarized my symptoms very quickly if it‘s helpful or informative. nnWishing you all the best! &lt;3nnn——————nnnMY DEPRESSION/SOCIAL ANXIETY SHORTLY SUMMARIZEDnMainly I‘d describe my depression as painful emptiness, anhedonia, not being able to get stimulated by anything, brutal dysphoria, feelings of guiltiness, lack of drive (almost lethargy), irrational negative thinking starting in the morning when I open my eyes, lack of appetite (getting damn skinny here) and so on.nnMy issues with my social anxiety is mainly getting physically and mentally nervous when anyone is around me (doesn‘t matter if family, good friends, strangers). Then I can’t think of anything to talk about, my head turns to a black hole of emptiness while irrational negative thoughts are still spinning. Another example when I walk on a street or somewhere and I see one person like 200-1000 meters away from me who‘s coming my way I already get nervous and prepare for/think about how I should act the best that this person won‘t think or see that I‘m insecure and depressive af. The typical „every stranger‘s eyes are on me, criticizing me and they all know what I‘m thinking in my head.“. Could write a whole lot more here but just a fee examples."

What effects do you get from Ashwagandha (preferably KSM-66)? What changes do you notice regarding mood, motivation/energy, anxiety, socializing/talkativeness and cognition?nn2. Does Ashwagandha need to be taken daily for some time to start showing effects?

My lab has weekly lab meetings to present our data and get feedback from the co-PIs and our peers. We’re a really close knit group, and everyone is friends with one another. nnSo, during lab meeting, I presented some new data as I do every week… We all have a similar sense of humor especially when things go wrong in our experiments &amp; results (which is often). So, I do my presentation, give an update on some things that went wrong and don’t make sense, so on and so forth. My co-PI asks to speak with me after lab meeting. (Mind you, this guy is king of cracking jokes during lab meeting.) He pulls me to his office and tells me I have a nervous laugh and it makes my presenting seem less serious. I know that about myself, I’m a generally pretty happy person. I do laugh at myself and smile a lot, especially around people I like (like my lab group). I didn’t take offense to his pointing out I have a nervous laugh - I’m aware of it, I’ll avoid it during serious presentations … However, he went on to tell me that my nervous laugh is *irritating* and the last thing I want to do is irritate my committee in my upcoming evaluation. nnIs it really that irritating when people have a nervous laugh or just generally laugh, joke, and smile a lot?

6939,"whattheelf","post","Social Anxiety enabled me to ""settle"" in romantic relationships","TDL: Socially anxious and awkward teenager who was relentlessly bullied for years, grew up to have a very low esteem and subsequently ended up in relationships with men she never genuinely loved or even liked, because she never thought she was worth more; she never thought she had the ability to choose a partner or that she would be lucky if ANYBODY wanted her. Now, after a lot of therapy, I can finally see that I deserved better.nnFor clarification, I am a 25 year old woman who grew up struggling with generalized and social anxiety. Although my social anxiety has grown less severe, it caused me to feel isolated for a large part of my early life. If I ever wanted to go on a date, I had to join apps like Tinder, Hinge, or Bumble because, I was too afraid to strike up a conversation with a guy in person. And, because I am not pretty in the *traditional sense*, I didn't get many matches, and only a small percentage of those matches (\~10%) actually wanted to ever to on a date with me.nnBeing bullied, albeit only by only a few mean boys, as an adolescent for being ""a mute"" really hurt my self-esteem and my ability to talk to guys later on. I remember crying in my favorite teacher's room during sophomore year of high school, because so many mean boys kept positioning me as the butt of their cruel jokes, even though I was always perfectly nice to them.nnFlash forward to college, boys are no longer verbally and emotionally abusing me, but I am totally invisible to them (my social anxious self felt safest when no one was paying attention to me). I begin to try apps like Tinder or Bumble, because I just wanted to be a normal girl and go on a date. What I got were misogynistic assholes who legit looked like a foot and only wanted to sleep with me, despite me constantly iterating that I am not looking to just ""hook-up."" Then, I was raped by a guy I met on Tinder, and all my friends blamed me and said I should have known better than to meet up with a guy from Tinder (wtf?). I blamed myself too, so I decided to accept that this is just the way things are. I began to regularly sleep with men I found anything but attractive (some were both physically and personably repulsive), in order to get a crumb of affection in return. I genuinely thought that this was all I was worth.nnFast forward to now, I am 25 and have never been in a genuinely loving relationship. I question even after all the therapy and piecing myself back together, and building my self esteem up from scratch, if I will ever meet someone I can actually love and will love me. Also, if you managed to read up until this point, what would you do now if you were me?"

I am a 17yo male, senior year in high school, 6'5 214LB, and very much an Introvert. When I'm at home, I'm on my computer 98% of the time. I have some insecurity issues such as my voice (even though deep down I know its fine and normal sounding), a small, almost unnoticeable lisp I have SOMETIMES, and I have never had a job or a girlfriend.nn&amp;#x200B;nnSo, here are my issues.nn&amp;#x200B;nnEver since middle school, I've been an Introvert and was becoming more and more of an Introvert on my path to high school. I don't have many friends, only a very close group of around 3 guys I've been around since elementary school and usually some classmates I chattered and joked around with on occasion, but not close enough to actually hang out with them. I've meet and made friendships with a small group other than my main group my Sophomore year, hung out throughout the year occasionally, and most of them moved away so now I don't have any communication with them. I mostly communicate with my main group over Discord (PC) and rarely hang out with them since they're busy most of the time, and we don't go to the same schools but live in relatively the same area. The biggest issue I have with myself is my lack of social skills. When it comes to talking to somebody I'm not exactly comfortable with, I brain works double time and get very stressed. In a way, I panic, but I don't make it obvious for the other person. Every time I speak to someone at school, no matter teacher or student, I feel as though my words are very forced and I'm concentrating as hard as I can to say whatever I have to say. I feel like my throat tightens when I speak to someone as well, and I lose breath fairly quickly. I try my best to not communicate with someone If I don't have to, and those moments where someone communicates with me, I get very overwhelmed and feel like I get put under a lot of pressure. I have essentially no social interaction outside of school other than my immediate family, and I won't count Discord as social interaction. Over Discord, I am free to be myself in front of my close friends, and even to people I'm not familiar with. I understand that when I'm behind a screen, the person I'm speaking to are unaware of who I look like and my insecurities, which is why I feel safe when talking to someone I don't know very well online. But there's another thing I don't understand. When my close group and I hang out IRL, I get stressed again when speaking to them. Not as stressed as if I was speaking to a classmate or teacher, but still somewhat uncomfortable. I feel as though this comes from my insecurities, such as the way I think I look and the way I speak. I be very picky about what I wear when I see them, such as what shirt looks better with what pants, and If I look better in this jacket today rather than this jacket, and is my hair good? How does my hair look? I feel like I'm in constant fear when I go out into public, but obviously not to the point where I completely avoid publicity. My social skills are something I need help with immensely, and It's causing me to feel very lonely.nnA few more things that have been on my mind as of recently; Soon I graduate high school. This is coming very quickly, and it happens in a few months. This frightens me. Where would I meet new people? How long would it be? My friends and I plan to move into an apartment together around the end of this year (2 close friends and myself), and I can't help but ponder about this. I'm dragging myself away from my mother (who I talk to the most) to where? A house with my friends? To do what? Pay rent and get my Associates degree? Would I just feel more alone since I'm away from the person I talk to the most? Would it just be my 2 close friends and I? It frightens me and I'm not sure what to expect from moving. I plan to go to a different college after I get my Associates at a community college. Another thing that has been on my mind is this one girl I had in my math class my Sophomore year. At the time, I had a slight crush on her because I found her personality very outgoing and relatable, though I never showed mine completely. I got more comfortable with her as the year went on and was talking to her in class sometimes. Once the year ended, she hadn't really crossed my mind. But one night, around August 2020, I decided that I should get a little baked since I haven't done it in a while (I was stealthy about it, my mother doesn't allow me to smoke). I was just chillin' listening to music on my computer, when all of a sudden she came into my memories again. I had a very bad trip that night. I was realizing how perfect I found her to be. I found her to be pretty, funny, very smart and she had a plan for what she wanted to do down the road for college. I ""stalked"" her on social media often, realizing that she had a boyfriend. Even some nights, I cried, knowing that she probably forgot I existed, but eventually came to terms with it by telling myself, ""She isn't dumb, and I'm sure if she has a boyfriend, he's a good one and treats her well."" My thoughts for her dissipated over the course of a few months after that night, but my feelings re-appeared a couple months ago in February.

I have some insecurity issues such as my voice (even though deep down I know its fine and normal sounding), a small, almost unnoticeable lisp I have SOMETIMES, and I have never had a job or a girlfriend.nnSo here are my issues.nnEver since middle school, I've been an Introvert and was becoming more and more of an Introvert on my path to high school. I don't have many friends, only a very close group of around 3 guys I've been around since elementary school and usually some classmates I chattered and joked around with on occasion, but not close enough to actually hang out with them. I've meet and made friendships with a small group other than my main group my Sophomore year, hung out throughout the year occasionally, and most of them moved away so now I don't have any communication with them. I mostly communicate with my main group over Discord (PC) and rarely hang out with them since they're busy most of the time, and we don't go to the same schools but live in relatively the same area. The biggest issue I have with myself is my lack of social skills. When it comes to talking to somebody I'm not exactly comfortable with, I brain works double time and get very stressed. In a way, I panic, but I don't make it obvious for the other person. Every time I speak to someone at school, no matter teacher or student, I feel as though my words are very forced and I'm concentrating as hard as I can to say whatever I have to say. I feel like my throat tightens when I speak to someone as well, and I lose breath fairly quickly. I try my best to not communicate with someone If I don't have to, and those moments where someone communicates with me, I get very overwhelmed and feel like I get put under a lot of pressure. I have essentially no social interaction outside of school other than my immediate family, and I won't count Discord as social interaction. Over Discord, I am free to be myself in front of my close friends, and even to people I'm not familiar with. I understand that when I'm behind a screen, the person I'm speaking to are unaware of who I look like and my insecurities, which is why I feel safe when talking to someone I don't know very well online. But there's another thing I don't understand. When my close group and I hang out IRL, I get stressed again when speaking to them. Not as stressed as if I was speaking to a classmate or teacher, but still somewhat uncomfortable. I feel as though this comes from my insecurities, such as the way I think I look and the way I speak. I be very picky about what I wear when I see them, such as what shirt looks better with what pants, and If I look better in this jacket today rather than this jacket, and is my hair good? How does my hair look? I feel like I'm in constant fear when I go out into public, but obviously not to the point where I completely avoid publicity. My social skills are something I need help with immensely, and It's causing me to feel very lonely.nnA few more things that have been on my mind as of recently; Soon I graduate high school. This is coming very quickly, and it happens in a few months. This frightens me. Where would I meet new people? How long would it be? My friends and I plan to move into an apartment together around the end of this year (2 close friends and myself), and I can't help but ponder about this. I'm dragging myself away from my mother (who I talk to the most) to where? A house with my friends? To do what? Pay rent and get my Associates degree? Would I just feel more alone since I'm away from the person I talk to the most? Would it just be my 2 close friends and I? It frightens me and I'm not sure what to expect from moving. I plan to go to a different college after I get my Associates at a community college. Another thing that has been on my mind is this one girl I had in my math class my Sophomore year. At the time, I had a slight crush on her because I found her personality very outgoing and relatable, though I never showed mine completely. I got more comfortable with her as the year went on and was talking to her in class sometimes. Once the year ended, she hadn't really crossed my mind. But one night, around August 2020, I decided that I should get a little baked since I haven't done it in a while (I was stealthy about it, my mother doesn't allow me to smoke). I was just chillin' listening to music on my computer, when all of a sudden she came into my memories again. I had a very bad trip that night. I was realizing how perfect I found her to be. I found her to be pretty, funny, very smart and had a plan to what she wanted to do down the road for college. I ""stalked"" her on social media often, realizing that she had a boyfriend. Even some nights, I cried, knowing that she probably forgot I existed, but eventually came to terms with it by telling myself, ""She isn't dumb, and I'm sure if she has a boyfriend, he's a good one and treats her well."" My thoughts for her dissipated over the course of a few months after that night, but my feelings re-appeared a couple months ago in February. I checked out her social media again, and it turns out she and her boyfriend broke up. Ever since I found out about this, she's been on my mind again, but I'm still not motivated to do anything about it. My social skills are ass, I barely know her and wouldn't know how to approach her, I'm a year ahead of her school-wise, I can't even talk to my classmates without feeling tense and stressed, and I don't even know how to introduce myself in a ""normal"" way. I've read other threads but they don't seem to help me as much as I expected them too, so I'm writing this as a last reach for help. I'm sorry for the long post, but I'm very much in need of help here. I need to know how to socialize with people.nnThank you."

Are you guys talking about it with your therapist or getting treatment?

It turned out horrible. I wouldn’t eat for the four days I was there and I wouldn’t go to the bathroom so I ended up holding my pee for almost 23 hours until I finally just went then held it again for over 20 hours. The process kept repeating. I couldn’t even talk. All I did was sit there and keep freaking out, wanting to go home. I love to eat and it’s normal for people to eat, that’s what I kept trying to tell myself, but still couldn’t get myself to do it. All the therapists ever say is “well the anxiety didn’t kill you, did it?” Mentally it did kill me and could have hurt myself while I wasn’t eating or going to the bathroom at all. My anxiety just keeps getting worse and I’m afraid of everything. I’m 20 and I feel like I’m never going to have a life because of it and I don’t know what to do. I’m home and never want to leave now."

I would say most days I am confident , sure of my abilities and feel good about myself. I go to the gym, dress/ groom well, make good friends, am competent at work and professionally and I am entertaining  in social situations. My problem is if I go a week or 2 or 3 without seeing friends I will feel like they don’t want me there or I am just bothering them etc, even though that never ends up being the case. Or I will have a moment where I start doubting myself in regards to my career or my future job prospects. At the end of the day I am aware of my abilities and that I am very capable but I will tend to fall into patterns of self doubt or low confidence even though in the past things have gone very well. I am just wondering if anyone else struggles with this on and off social anxiety/low confidence and how to address it In a long term context? Obviously I find that when I do the things that help me : aka socializing, exercising, eating good, self care , I don’t feel this way as much but besides therapy does anyone have any other suggestions?"
6960,"Comfortable-Map-6287","post","Accountability with Social Anxiety in relationships...","I never dated til a few years ago when I met my very serious partner. I (f25) struggled with dating and romance as a whole because of my social anxiety as well as the fact I'm demi-sexual so I have no attraction without emotional connection...but emotional connection is hard to find with social anxiety a lot of the time. I was never ""open enough"" to seem available and wasn't forward enough to let someone know I was interested potentially if I did want to know someone more, but even then I wasn't attracted yet so it woupd usually just slip to the wayside.nnNow that I'm in a relationship, there's a lot to unpack with a whole other person seeing me so closely every day...My bf sees me through everything. I cry all the time and I get frustrated with myself and he sees that too. I guess as a child I never really imagined living past 17...not in a morbid way, but absolute freedom and singularity and actually being responsible for all aspects of my life was terrifying. Every letter, every phone call, every meeting or interview made my nerves fried and living too the point where I was that version of myself was a nightmare. And when I became 18-now every year is full of more and more growing pains as I acclimate to new sources of stress and new concerns with my loved ones health and taking care of the people I care about.nnThe older I get the more my social anxiety becomes a fear of failing as a daughter, wife, granddaughter, friend... and not being strong enough to do what I got to do to support the people I care about because my anxiety could hold me back. I'm 25 and still terrified to drive. Never took the test. Driving feels like an extension of my social fears with heavier consequences. That panic feeling of walking down a hall and crossing paths with others or angering someone by being too slow or too fast or bumping into them. So yeah...I'm terrfied every time my loved ones are ill or if they'd need to go to the doctor or hospital. I'm terrified of getting engaged only because I'm scared of having all eyes on me at a wedding...but I want to get married and it sucks I feel like I could ruin that for myself. nnI just wish life could pause every few months for like...a week of absolute no mental pressure. It's exhausting and makes me put things off and I'm always terrfied my low points will disappoint my bf or parents and I'm just going to get called lazy. Because thats how my parents treated me as a kid when my anxiety was bad...they thought I was just too lazy to get out and do things and would get mad. I feel like a failure for having these concerns as an adult and I really want to be better but until I find the right therapist for me I'm kinda stuck on my own tripping through every day. Mostly I try really hard to bbe accountable for myself and recognize my stress isn't always the priority. In big situations I got to consider others too and try and be communicative and not place the burden on others to assure me 100x because honestly it doesnt work anyway."
6963,"Gottchen","post","Experiences with Gabapentin as Antidepressant &amp; Social Anxiety Medication","Hey, so I had some gabapentin from some time ago prescribed by my doc for my depression, social anxiety and psychosomatic pain (or whatever it is). nnWhy Gabapentin? Because I have been completely therapy resistant to all the SSRIs, SNRIs and one MAOI as well as a tricyclic. I‘m also in behavioral therapy right now, just to let you know.nnI only took 300mg every morning before breakfast for the last 7 days and well, it was more effective than any other med I tried. My depression was 90% vanished. My cognition (focus, memory, logical thinking) started being functional again. I didn’t feel dumbed out and cognitively retarded anymore. I even felt smart. I especially noticed  my better cognition in social events and conversations a lot but also at reading, following movies and just remembering general knowledge. My head didn‘t feel empty and dysfunctional anymore. My brain was working again.nnIt did more for my depression than my social anxiety but hell sure the cognitive improvements helped with socializing too. I still felt some kind of nervous before having to socialize but when I was in the social situation I was much more talkative, funny and social. I was enjoying my ability to think clearer, finally being cognitively more functional and definitely feeling some reduced social anxiety.nnI know that my dose of 300mg is very low, so I think that a higher dose might not only help my depression and negative thinking but maybe also increase the social anxiety reducing effects.nnWhat I would like to know of you guys:nn1. If you have some experience with using Gabapentin for depression and/or social anxiety, what fose have you been on and what effects or changes did you notice regarding depression, negative thinking, mood, energy/motivation and especially social anxiety and sociability/talkativeness/extroversion.nn2. Ive only been taking the gabapentin daily for 6 days now as I heard a lot about its withdrawals being hellish and horrible af. What‘s your opinion on this or do you eve have any experiences with withdrawals? How bad are they, how long do they last after how much time on daily gabapentin?nn3. Is it possible to use gabapentin occasionally on a only if needed basis? Or is it needed for depression and anxiety disorders to take it daily for better effects and symptom reduction?Like 3-4 days a week only to hinder tolerance and withdrawal. That‘s what I would do it like if possible as I have experience with GABA withdrawals and they are not nice."

I don’t know if it’s stubbornness or what, but I just can’t socialize, and now it’s turning into I “won’t” socialize. nnThe best era of my life was in elementary school when I had no anxiety, and that feels really stupid to say. I’m 20, and feel as though I missed out on so much, because I did. I literally did nothing for 7 years. It’s a mix of being shy, introverted and socially anxious. My best achievement over 7 years is recently going to a drive thru, but it actually felt good and I feel stupid for thinking that, because it’s such a little thing. During high school I had to do presentations. You’d think that would help but it made it worse since I would rethink every that went wrong until I graduated. I don’t want this to happen in college. I have a few friends that invite me to do things, but I rarely accept. They’re normal outgoing people, and understand I have social anxiety and are fine with it, stating no they’ll try and get me out of my shell, but I keep declining every invitation. nnAlso worth mentioning I’m to anxious to see a doctor relating to this.

I don't know how, but I somehow managed to accidentally dial 911 on my phone, of all numbers. I started panicking and didn't want to have to explain, so I just hung up (which I know realize how back that is).nnI got like 3 calls from an unknown number later that day, but just ignored them cause I can't talk to strangers on the phone. Like 3 hours later I decided to look up what happens if you hang up on 911, and then learned that if you don't tell them it was an accident, they have to send out police to check on you and make sure you're ok. nnSo after like 10 minutes of me debating what to do, I finally called them, and my voice was shaking so much I could barely talk to the lady that picked up. I told her that there wasn't any emergency and she was really nice about it, but I'm still having flashbacks and can't get over how stupid I must have sounded. I don't really know what a panic attack is like, but I think I may have had one at that time since I was probably about to cry and couldn't breathe.nnAnyways, this is just one of the millions of interactions that I can't stop looking back on. I still remember moments from like preschool that make me want to hit myself for something stupid I said or some dumb awkward moment, and it gives me so much stress I can't ever relax.nnSo this post was pretty much a mess of a rant, but I think just any tips on how I can get over these moments would be really helpful. I'm not looking to go to a therapist or seek professional help, but I want a way to just leave all these moments behind. If anyone has any tips that stops them from getting so much stress from social interactions, or has had similar experiences and can explain how they got over them, that would be great cause honestly social anxiety is ruining my life lol."

I’ve always been a shy and quiet guy but honestly I feel like I’m even more socially awkward in this pandemic where I take classes on zoom.

I felt like he didn’t understand my social anxiety because of how he’s dismissed some of my feelings, and because of how he’s handled it, but he’s proud of me for doing something as small as scheduling a license test and that did surprise me. nFor me, getting my license is an important, big and small step towards getting better. Now I can’t use it as an excuse to not get a job. I still don’t know when i’ll be able to do that, but it does remove a barrier. I still have to get used to going outside and stuff.

I was even told by someone they thought I had it (not in a mean way). I honestly would not be surprised if I did have it. I work a job where I have to talk to a lot of regulars every day, a lot of customers. I change my personality for almost every person because I am trying to manipulate them into liking me, no matter really who they are. I also have a disorder that effects my facial appearance. I had a very good looking mother and father and I still look decent from the front, but from one side I look very odd and funny. I've even been laughed at because of it. Basically I'm constantly worrying about how others are seeing me, at what angle, what they think of me, what tone of voice to use, etc. I come across so many different ways and I'm sure people think I'm a future serial killer or some pedophile. I have had therapy but nothing has really worked. I have gotten better over the years because it manifested around 4th/5th grade. I feel like such an ugly person, inside and out.

I hate traveling, shopping, meeting new people and basically anything in everyday life that requires human interaction. When I go out with a few friends I am terrified of running into someone I know. When I'm in a group of people, especially if there is someone I don't know in the group, I am quiet or don't say more than one sentence. I hate being the center of attention and I feel like it's getting worse rather than better with time. I want to do something about it but I'm even too anxious to go to a therapist as it's not exactly normal to go to a therapist where I live."

I can do my thing, meet with co-workers, and feel secure and not freak out so much.

And I haven't been treated properly by mental health teams (in UK) so I cannot ever hope of receiving adequate meds. I'm not a stupid or morally vacuous person, so I can't live with being a bum for the rest of my life. I can't deal with the SA or GAD. I tried exposure and I just got worse. I tried meds and they didn't do a thing. I was keeping very healthy and active. Maybe something like an MAOI, a benzo, a mood stabilizer, antipsychotic, even a stimulant, could have helped me, but I got stuck with an organisation who are zealotic about SSRI SNRI only. Medication aside, it is too late for me. I can't socialise or form meaningful relationships, and I can't contribute to society. I'll never find love, have a career, travel. The condition has (unsurprisingly) made me severely depressed, meaning my motivation to move upwards was little. There is nowhere to go now.

Once I get out the first 1-2 words the rest of the sentence goes fluently. But it starts all over again on the next sentence because, even though my brain acknowledges the quick success of the first sentence, it immediately goes into defense mode right when I want to talk more.nnYour typical chicken and egg problem: What came first? (1) Have I always been a stutterer and anxiety amplified it? Or (2) did my anxiety get so bad that my brain stops to function.nn(1): Possible but should be a much lighter stutter, then. I remember from age 10-15 I could talk in a relatively fluent way. I don't know of any brain trauma, intoxications or really anything that could have triggered a neurological stutter.nn(2) Science suggests that anxiety doesn't cause stuttering per se.

I can talk just fine in front of a mirror, to my dog, reading stuff, recording my voice on the computer, ...nnI even went to a speech therapist once and they said they couldn't help me because I didn't stutter!

I'm only 21 and it feels like my life is complete trash already. I want nice friends to hang out with, a cute girlfriend and a fulfilling career. The worst is, I had all that already.

I tried about 9 different antidepressants (all the SSRIs, SNRIs as well as moclobemide, opipramol, amitriptyline and neuroleptics). None had any effect, zero. I also tried 2 depth psychological therapies and am in a behavioral therapy right now. No effect, no success, zero.nnI abused alcohol from 17-19 daily beginning in the morning with hard stuff like vodka as self medication for my social anxiety. Fucked up, I know. I was drunk at school, at sports, at meetups with friends, at dinner with mom. Until I had big addiction and lost my drivers license due to having alcohol 24/7 in my blood. It doesnt work anymore for me. I didnt drink since then. Same for phenibut. Also phenibut is way too addictive and withdrawals make everything so much worse. Kratom sadly has no effect for me (tried different vendors, strains, high doses up to 12g, nothing).nnI tried many many supplements, spent way too much money for them and nothing worked.nnSo whats up now? I read about Lemon Balm and its effects on GABA. GABAergics have been the only substances helpful for me.nnMy questions:nn1. What have been your experiences with Lemon Balm? Had it some significant effect regarding mood/depression and anxiety especially social anxiety, so talkativeness, verbal fluidity, not thinking about what others might think about you and all the social worrying. Is it worth it? Noticeable, psychoactive, significant or just very subtle near placebo?nn2. What has been your dose? Will it work from the first pill or is it similar to antidepressants that you need to take it for weeks until it starts working?nn3. What are good brands or products that are effective? or will every normal powder do it? Rather normal powder or extract?"

I can't think straight even if the person isn't meaning to be antagonistic, I just feel, again, like I've failed in some unforgivable waynn-sometimes I wonder if other people receive as much criticism or negative feedback as I do, which leads me to wonder if I'm just particularly hyper focused on negative feedback rather than any positive feedbacknn-if I get negative feedback, especially in a work setting, I seriously contemplate moving to a new town or state to start over and try not to make any mistakes in the new placenn-i really struggle with being extremely over apologetic in lots of situations. If I feel I've said or done the wrong thing, be it at work or just being with friends, I just want to convey that I am sorry and promise whatever happened won't happen again, even though I can see it makes others uncomfortablennthose are just a few examples, and I'm curious to know how some of you might cope with these things, or if anyone has similar experiencesnnthank you all in advance!"

I'm afraid that they'll tell me that everyone struggles with this and I just need to get over it. I've also never really been that emotional or open to my parents, or anyone for that matter - I kind of just keep my thoughts and emotions to myself. nnI have a doctor's check-up soon and was planning on mentioning it there and see if they have any recommendations on who I can talk to or what I can do (Idk if this is the best approach to starting to get help)? I'm also scared of what my parents will think of me if I mention therapy or end up going to therapy - idk, I know obviously there's nothing wrong with therapy, but I feel like the only one in my family who's ever struggled with some sort of serious mental health issues - everyone else in my family seems fine, so I feel like I'm just weird or out of place."

I hit gym three times a week, sometimes I feel confident and more like an extrovert with the right people.nnBut.. there are sometimes awkward situations that kills me inside. Like now. My brothers run an agency and from time to time I work there since it's in the office where I can focus.nnToday there was a new employee and I had so much stress before introducing myself you know.. It was awkward and I had not entirely panick attack.. But I was red, shy, awkward and couldn't speak properly.. u know that shit..nnIt is killing me so much because I'm really an extrovert. I love when I'm in the group of people that I know and can have fun with (doesn't have to be under alcohol influence). I love that and it gives me energy. But on the other side I'm also an introvert because sometimes I like to just mind my business at home.nnAnd it's been just worse and worse. Having anxiety when going through the city, now even in introduction with other people. I just want to cry now.nnSo.. what can I do. I tried ETF tapping - I don't know doesn't helped me but I still do it sometimes. I tried affirmations, and other type of shit and nothing helped and I'm so done with that anxiety. I want to live my life to the fullest but shit is hard.nnI need some therapy I guess.. but what a person like me which has not a lot of money at the moment can do?? You know.. The best ones charge insane amount of money.nnI guess my life purpose as an entrepreneur will be to create some platform where you can get help for free haha. Anyways.. anyone has any tips?

This year, I got a higher dose of prozac and I am now taking 20mg. Sometimes I feel that it makes me more anxious. I just hate that social anxiety is basically my life. It’s all I know. I never talked at school because of it. Like I literally didn’t talk to anyone from kindergarten to my senior year of high school. They thought I had Aspergers but I got diagnosed with Social anxiety disorder instead. I hate that it (and my other mental illnesses) make me feel so worthless and that my life feels empty. I can’t get a job because of it. I don’t have friends because of it…. I just am not happy."
7126,"Mr_Jek","post","My coworkers have invited me out for drinks and it’s triggered so much anxiety in me over the thought of making new friends","nI don’t really know where this comes from. It’s definitely related to my social anxiety. A few months back I started a new job and usually I don’t really fit in in a lot of places, but I actually genuinely like the people I work with and over time I’ve gotten more comfortable and have gotten closer to quite a lot of them. I’m not used to this; at uni I didn’t make any friends, old workplaces I was on good terms with people but made very few real friendships and didn’t attend many gatherings outside of work, etc. I’ve had the same group of friends since school and while I love them, I feel like I’ve outgrown them a little. Not enough to not hang out with them, but enough that I think I need to branch out and meet new people.nnToday a girl I work with told me a bunch of people from work are going to a bar tomorrow and she said they’d be really glad if I could make it because a lot of people in work agree I’d be really fun to hang out with. I told her I’d think about it and let her know. The thing that holds me back is whenever I start making new friends I get anxious and start thinking that if my old friends see me making new friends, or making plans without them, they’ll get jealous and stop being friends with me.nnI know this is ridiculous. All my friends have friends from work, they have relationships, they have other people in their life. I’ve never really had that though and it feels weird. I know it’s a great opportunity for me deep down, but the thought does make me anxious and I feel like in some way this is my brain trying to justify that anxiety. Making new friends is scary and it’s like my brain’s saying ‘don’t do that, it will mess everything up’ and trying to find any justification not to.nnThe thing is though when I started this job I WANTED to meet new people. It would really enrich my life. There’s even a girl at work who will be there that I’ve been messaging back and forth with and kind of have a crush on, and this would be a great opportunity for us to hang out in a relaxed group setting outside of work. There’s no downside. But that anxiety just gnaws away, that if I make new friends my current ones will abandon me, that I’ll somehow end up alone and friendless and it will be my fault. I think looking back the reason I haven’t made friends post-school isn’t because of other people, but because opportunities probably did arise and I didn’t accept them enough because of this very anxiety. It has really held me back. The only reason I’m able to recognise it now is because I’ve been getting therapy for anxiety, but it’s still tough to unlearn that behaviour. Usually I’d just stay home alone and try ignore it, and probably have people think I don’t like them, but I’m fed up of that. I want to change."

I’ve wanted a girlfriend for years now (never had one unless you count a brief relationship in elementary. I’ve never had a kiss or date either), and I’ve tried many times, which have resulted in failures. nnOn one hand, this has upset me and given me the opposite of confidence. On the other hand, it’s been a good thing I haven’t got a date/gf all this time. Girls want talkative funny guys, and I’m neither. I’m obviously introverted but it’s rather extreme. Like, at most, I can keep a conversation going for a few minutes before I run out of steam. The only ones I can talk to 1on1 for anything more than 10 minutes are either my immediate family members or my absolute best (about 3-5) friends. nnI got a group of best friends that I talk to a lot but it’s not like I’m talking to them 1v1 while in the group mostly and it’s not like I’m the leading man in the conversations. I’ll say some stuff, interject at times, and listen a lot. Something else that doesn’t help is that our group was founded on watching stuff together, like movies, shows, videos, etc. that’s what we do. So, even when we’re hanging out, there are long periods of time when we don’t even talk, and once we’re done watching whatever, we’ll talk about that. nnRegarding humor, if I’m ever funny, it’s mostly situational. I don’t have the wit or intelligence to come up with a bunch jokes like a lot of guys, who are with girls, seem to do. I also have a bad habit of talking bad about myself. I was told this years ago and years later I haven’t quite got rid of that problem yet. Tbf, a lot of it stems from my lack of confidence and social anxiety. nnSo, who can an anxious loner go to for help with conversation skills? There’s gotta be some kind of professional help through therapy or psychology, or something?"

7138,"TheWesternWitcher","post","Feeling hopeless and need to vent","24M here feeling like I just need to get some stuff out somewhere and hopefully this is allowed here. So a little background first I guess: I've always been a quiet kind of guy, friends were made through friends of people I know and kind of sat back and let conversations play out.nnWell a few years ago I moved away from one of the few towns I've called home to start a life with my partner on the other side of the country (UK) and due to that stopped talking to the few friends I had as I was struggling to keep my life afloat just with work and figuring out the ins and outs of running a household. Throw in a few traumatic life events and I basically just imploded. Should probably also mention I've been dealing with depression for over a decade.nnAnyway, not talking to my family and friends for a long time seems to have thrown me into my anxiety tenfold. Even though I now have more contact recently with my sister and my mother, with whom it's always been close-knit amongst the three of us, and I have no trouble with talking or explaining things to my amazingly supportive partner; with all others, even once close friends, I just can't bring myself to initiate a conversation let alone hold one together.nnIt makes me feel like a sociopath sometimes, like when one of my previously close friends who asks my family about me a lot suffered a bereavement recently. I had to look up and ask my partner how I should express my condolences! I just couldn't think of what to say and this has happened for multiple different occasions. I can't even start a conversation with people who I might want to get to know as the question of how they're doing or general ice breakers don't occur to me, my mind just goes blank and I can't think of anything.nnThe worst part for me is that it's not just limited to face to face. Talking to others online, be it through a chat or even VOIP in games (I hate to imagine a video call!), I can't bring myself to interact with anyone as there is a constant deep feeling of fear that I struggle to overcome. Even as I type this I am second guessing myself and wondering whether to even post it.nnI think that's probably all I have to say at the moment, I just needed to get it out I guess. Here's hoping the stronger prescription and a third/fourth year of talking therapy might help solve my issues. If you made it this far, thank you for reading, hope it didn't get anyone else feeling down"
7139,"eggylandscaper","post","Does your voice change whenever you're anxious around people?","Hi guys, so I have debilitating social anxiety. I'm 21 and had it since I was in elementary school and this has been happening to me for as long as I can remember, ever since I developed social anxiety at least.nnWhenever I talk to ANYONE outside my family (since I'm not shy around them) my voice changes. It doesn't matter if I've known them for 5 years or 5 seconds. I have a different voice around people outside my family. It's been happening since I was a kid and I haven't spoken about it till now. I feel the voice whenever I'm shy and insecure, which is around. Basically everyone. It's like a different persona. And it is, since obviously I'm not myself around people and hide my entire personality. My voice is higher pitched and sometimes it's even hard to speak. I sound like a completely different person. When I'm by myself or around my family members, my voice is deeper, not as meek sounding, very expressive, and just myself. I hate this so much, it's been ruining my life and not allowing me to live. I've been suffering at school, jobs, or even during small talk. I even had the voice with friends I knew for 5-6 years, who eventually left me because of how dreadfully boring I was due to the anxiety. I have a very extreme case and have sought out psychological help though it hasn't gone further than just being talked to and basically told to ""be more confident"" during therapy sessions, and somehow, nothing ever helped me. I'm no better than I was as a kid. I've shaken a lot for no reason, during completely normal interactions, even doctor's appts when they came too close to me and held my hand since I felt like they were watching and judging my every move.nnI'm so self conscious around people I constantly feel like all eyes are on me, that people are observing my every move and notice even when I lift a finger. I have very low self-esteem and fear I'll never get better. It's not just the average shyness where I might cutely freeze then remember what I was gonna say a second later and eventually open up and be my goofy self. I never open up. I agree with everything others say and only respond if I'm spoken to. BUT THE VOICE IS THE MOST ANNOYING PART! I HATE IT SO MUCH!nnLast year, I was actually on the path to overcoming my anxiety. Right before COVID started, that completely flung me backwards. I had a few interactions with people (in class, ordering food) WITHOUT THE VOICE. IT WAS A MIRACLE. I felt so much less anxious to the point the shy voice didn't take over. But then after COVID, it got 100x worse. It comes without me controlling it. I literally open my mouth and if I'm speaking to someone I'm uncomfortable around, it happens. Then as soon as I get home, it's gone. I can't even mimic the voice when I'm by myself or w/ family. it only happens when I go outside and talk to people. This is the weirdest shit ever, anyone relate??"

Many of the exposure challenges my therapist has described, are 'weird' in nature. I know they are weird. I can clearly feel from facial expressions that they are weird, **that is why I have the anxiety in the first place**.nnThis would not be a problem if I actually had it, but it just feels frustrating and more misunderstanding, especially if it's with problem with people I kind of know. Not all of the challenges my therapist gave, are done with complete strangers.nnWhy is every person in the Western world who tries to bravely overcome their social anxiety,  compared to ""atypical"" or something like that? I've had girls reject me who initially liked me, because their friends convinced them I was ""atypical"" (yes literally said like that).  nnI had some random old ladies on the train (I have really bad anxiety in public and blush and my muscles tighten up) go like oh that's Asperger to each other, without even asking me. All due respect to old ladies but that IS SO RUDE!nnThis doesn't help people with either Autism or Social Anxiety or those who have both?  nnnHow can I clearly explain to people, that as much as I respect people on the spectrum, this is just not what I have and also cannot and am not going to pretend to have?

So that’s a way of coping for me. I point out something, a tattoo or a nice coat, compliment and ask questions.

I have a hard time focusing on people when they talk because I’m always worried about what I’m going to say next or making sure I have something prepared mentally for the next pause in conversation.

I am so lonely, it makes me literally physically ill. I feel as if I have a void in my chest, every time I see a cute girl I have a lump in my throat, every time I see a couple - especially if they're holding hands, cuddling or having a picnic on a blanket - I feel nauseous. I am also incredibly self-conscious in public. I feel like everyone judges me for being short, I feel like everyone stares at me, I can't relax.  nnnHaving a girlfriend is my biggest dream, as stupid as that sounds. All that lovey-dovey stuff. Picnics, walks together, long evening conversations, cuddling, staying in bed in autumn, making tea for each other etc. I know it's not all magic and after some time reality sets in but it's just life. I don't even know where to start. I feel unattractive, I feel inadequate. I see beautiful, intriguing girls everywhere, but I don't feel worthy of them. Someone like me?

One of the main thing is that I rarely ever talked as a kid. Like I may have only spoken 6 words to a person through middle school and high school. I didn't think much of it..and chalked it upto me being introverted and just not interested in people. But recently some old friends were sharing old middle school memories and to the suprise of no one...nobody knew who I was. Like I was invisible. nnBut that didn't bother me. What bothered me was someone made a comment that ' i don't think I even heard you speak'. This got me thinking and yes..it is true that I didn't speak to anyone when I was around 10 to 11 till now ( I guess I am slightly better at holding up a conversation but still would rather listen then talk). Not even to my parents or sisters. No one.nnI would just go to school, come back home, do my homework, watch movies and read and sleep. Rinse and Repeat from middle school to high school so like a good chunk of my life.nnMy parents just thought that this was normal (no it really isn't) and now I am wondering if there is psychology cause to it or i didn't talk as a coping mechanism (selective mutisim?) Because even now ( i am 20) i rarely talk to anyone and can't speak eloquently without jumbling up my words or going on meaningles tangents and word vomit(and especially not in my native tongue)nnShould I be concerned?

7177,"tylerandmoroll","post","Feeling toxic due to the amount of Anxiety I deal with","Hello all, this is my first time opening up truly about this on a forum. And I guess I'm looking for either some compassion, understanding, hope, and possibly advice. Although a warning, I've been stubborn with advice before. My anxiety is always consistently overthinking so If someone tries to give me ways to fix it, I always have this uncomfortable feeling and way around it. It's bad. And also, this is long. nn&amp;#x200B;nnI'm a 24 yr old male. While I've had anxiety all my life, my last relationship REALLY did a number on me. She dealt with a lot. I dealt with a lot, and together it clashed and I never really saw any of it till after the relationship was over. I was always pushed to get a job to pay bills. And the constant switching of jobs, feeling like I'm a failure, then wanting to quit cycle really did a number on me. It also doesn't help the fact that I absolutely am uncomfortable driving. I can take public transportation (if I plan it out well enough). But every time I've been behind the wheel of the car. Pure fear. Consistently worrying about wrecking. Being judged in all scenarios. It's awful.nnThis also doesn't help the fact of closer relationships. It's been more than a year since I've broken up with my ex. And I'm absolutely willing to date again. This time is tougher, because I live at home with my parents. Been doing therapy and seeing a psychiatrist for a year. Slowly helping little bits. But the anxiety is still strong. And telling girls this, is extremely tough. If I get a response. I tell them the truth, and then get ghosted, even if they say they're okay with it. I recently had a friend who I had a crush on basically throw the social anxiety in my face about it. She's dating someone, and we're just friends for context. But she was trying to help me. Until she got upset and said ""I've given you many options to go out and go to events, you don't listen to me"" etc.. Even though I was open in the very beginning. nnI've also cut off many friends in the past year due to feeling too judged. It was probably for the best. But I've been called sexist, and been shot down. Been called an asshole, etc.. Whether it was the right decision or not to actually cut those people out. I can't help but continue to feel like I am this toxic person. Because I want a way to fix me, but in a weird way. I don't want things to change if that makes sense. I live with my parents. I have lots of free time for music and hobbies. But seeking a girlfriend who's okay with all that? I highly doubt. Plus, I would like to be able to make some sort of money and have just a little more freedom. nnI'm also JUST starting to try and lose weight (again, after like 4 times). I succeeded once. But relapsed in my last relationship. It's been a good start, I'm hoping that in the end if I really achieve my goal. Maybe I'll be more open to things having a new major confidence. nnBasically as of right now, my brain wants this scenario which is EXTREMELY unlikely to happen. And I'm not even sure I fully want this. But I just want try for SSI. To be able to not have to worry about the future. Having a form of income even if it's low. Find a partner who could build me up and go on MINI adventures with (coffee shops, local stores, etc..). Only use public transportation when I need it. And I know, that absolutely sounds ridiculous and I agree. That's why I'm hoping to maybe do online school. Go into a field of coding, scripting, maybe even cyber security. Something I can make a living off of, but remotely. I would be content with that, and not feel like I've chosen the easy way out by just trying to get disability. For me, that is the VERY last thing if I can't do anything else. nnI'm all over the place, if you have questions, don't hesitate to ask! I'm a very friendly person, I'm just stubborn with mental health and all this. But, I'd like to get some insight. See if others have been able to figure out how to overcome certain things or who also deal with it. I've left out a lot to this list of things that make me anxious. It's already long enough. But regardless, thank you for reading this post."

I felt that if I talked they would think i’m weird but if I didn’t they would think i’m boring, so my anxiety starter kicking in and being way worse.nnI hated going to school because of them bothering me, I was just looking forward for it to finish so I could go home. nn8th grade I lost my only friend because of the lack of communication I had, but I started being friends w another girl which was amazing. If she didn’t attend to school I would have really bad anxiety, I would feel everyone staring at me, thinking I had no friends and that I was too weird for someone to like me, I felt overwhelmed, I had breakdowns at school, had to lock myself in the bathroom or fake illness to skip school. nnThen Covid started and they closed schools and any social interaction was forbidden, I was getting so much better bc then I didn’t have  to go to school or miss any party because of my anxiety bc no one was gathering. nnBut later that year, when people started to ignore the fact that covid was killing, they decided to gather again. My sister has always been a big social butterfly unlike me, a social anxiety bookworm, she was invited to all of these parties so my mom made me go with her, she doesn’t understand what social anxiety is, and I also didn’t at that time, but I knew it wasn’t shyness and that I didn’t fit to the “introvert” definition.nnI was too nervous to meet people, my anxiety only got worse, I wouldn’t go to those parties bc I couldn’t stand meeting other people.nBut she made me go to a small reunion, I couldn’t breathe, I felt dizzy all the time and my heart was beating the fastest, couldn’t even stand eye contact, I felt like throwing up and started having these thoughts “no one wants me here” “they think i’m weird” “I don’t fit” “they think i’m looking pathetic” “they’re probably laughing about me” to the point I had to go and hide in the bathroom bc of how overwhelmed I was. nn2 months later I went to a party this time, it only got worse so I tried to figure out why I was feeling this way, social anxiety came by so I did my research and these symptoms were all I was felling since i’m 7, so I started to think I had social anxiety. nnI don’t want a diagnosis for two reasons: nn-My parents are not going to be comprehensive about itn-I don’t really feel ready to go to therapy nnI’m 100% sure I have social anxiety and even tho a diagnosis would make a lot of things easier, it would make other things worse. nnCould y’all tell me what do you think about my story? what do you think I should do about getting a diagnosis? how can I get better?

I freeze up and feel like I can't breathe when it comes to even thinking about new social situations. I dream of becoming a PA in my future career. Obviously with that career, social skills are extremely important to have, and you need medical jobs to get experience to get in to the program. I felt that for me the best way to battle it was to get exposure to it and start doing it more and more and just eventually become used to it to the point where I don't get anxiety anymore. I don't wanna live my whole life like this, I wanna be outgoing talkative and not scared of social interaction. So I applied for jobs. I recently was hired at a pediatric office and I started this week. My job involves answering phone calls to the office/making appointments for patients, bringing patients to the back and taking their vitals, and checking them out when they leave. Lots of people stuff, which of course gives me the worst anxiety. I know I have to battle it someday and better late than never. I wanna be good at this job so I can also be good at my future career. I also wanna be cool with my coworkers, I don't want them to think of me as just that awkward girl that doesn't talk and is useless at her job. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle going to work? Bc honestly my plan right now is just to take a deep breath and go for it. And I'm not too sure how well that's going to work when I start doing the tasks on my own. I think this job is a really good thing for me and I have the motivation to do well and battle my anxiety but I just don't know how to start."

I thought of asking for a lighter and then maybe I'll say something about the lecture to start a conversation but I just can't do it.

7193,"lunarwitch13","post","Working in an office with social anxiety caused by ADHD","I kinda just want to rant but also get some advice because idk what to do and I'm really stressed out about it.nnI started my first full time job recently at 22, I work in an office and it's completely open plan so there is literally no avoiding people. I've had social anxiety pretty much all my life, tried exposing myself by working as a waitress which didn't help, also tried therapy which didn't help. I got diagnosed with ADHD at 21 and going on medication for that is literally the only thing that has ever helped. nnMy social anxiety only affects me when I first meet people, but also with people I have nothing in common with. It's completely caused by my ADHD, I just cannot do small talk at all my mind goes BLANK and it gets much worse the more tired I am. If I try to make small talk it gets pretty awkward because I struggle to come up with words and forget what I was going to say, I just end up stumbling over my sentences and start fidgeting. nnWhen I first started work I was a bit shy which I naturally am, but I wasn't too bad and was quite proud of myself. But the more I've been working the worse I've gotten. Because I've gone from not working much at all to doing 8 hours a day 5 times a week, I'm understandably getting more tired as I go on. This has led to my meds not working as well and as I said before my social anxiety naturally is worse the more tired I am, because my ADHD is worse. nnBecause of this I've been getting more and more quiet and overall awkward at work. Everyone else is at least 10 years older than me and I just have nothing in common with them. None of them really try that much to talk to me and I just keep my head down and get on with my work. Because of my ADHD I get heavily fixated on my work and in the zone for hours. I don't even want to talk to people when I'm working because it just distracts me and disrupts my focus. But there's a lot of pressure to socialise, people have started making comments about how quiet my area is and people talk to me even less now. I can just sense people think I'm odd and awkward and I'm pretty sure I overheard someone saying it too. It's really starting to stress me out and making me feel anxious when I didn't feel like this before. I dread going into work because I feel so much pressure to try and make small talk and I feel like everyone is really really judging me, because I know they are. I got home today and just burst into tears because of it, I felt so exhausted today but really tried to speak to people and I just made a mess of it. nnI don't know what to do. My medication was fine up until recently, I don't really want to push the dose. I don't know if I'm just being pathetic and should get on with it or look for another job that's remote. I feel so shit about myself I'd love any advise or whatever :("

Because I'm so quiet and reserved, I'm too focused on my work and never socialize with my coworkers. I'm just there for my paychecks, not there for making friends or enemies, nothing but chasing that money bag.

And the people I helped were very happy I was there to help (apart from one, customer service is fun). So even though I’m analysing everything as I write this, and will probably come up with a bunch of ways I screwed up, at least I proved to myself I can do something as scary as a job at a call centre. nnJust wanted to make this post to help others see that we are capable of a lot, even if we are afraid. If you guys haven’t seen Eighth Grade, you should totally watch it. I kept thinking about what she said in that, it was something along the lines of “to be confident, you need to be brave, and to be brave, you need to be scared.” Sort of Ned Starkesque. nnSo I’ve actually been to two therapists for mental health, and my last one, specifically for social anxiety. She helped me a lot with managing my thoughts with thought diaries and such. And I’ve honestly just been slowly putting myself out into the world, like when I was 16, I couldn’t go anywhere without my mum.

I was experiencing terrible symptoms entering high school like hyperawareness of my senses, butterflies in stomach , and very nervous to speak to people. It was tormenting I don't know how I got through it. I told my mom I needed help but she just passed it off as shyness and that it would go away eventually. It didn't. I just coped with it all 4 years, didn't make any good friends , go to prom or other events. I told my mom again that I really need to get treated and she told me medication will screw me up and to just take supplements cause she trusts her nutritionist brother more than anything. I'm still the same.. Can't believe all these years have gone by and she still thinks It'll magically go away. When I turned 18 I thought I'd be able to finally get proper treatment. Nope, my mom is still controlling as usual.nnI know I should move out but I don't know if I can even handle living alone and it's expensive I've never even had an actual job. It doesn't help that my brother moved out last year and now she expects me to stay with her and pay off things so how would I afford living on my own? I'm just screwed. Social anxiety pretty much ended my life"

7220,"krussha","post","Autism misdiagnosis","I've only posted on Reddit once before, so please let me know if this is the wrong subreddit to post this.nnI a 17F and was diagnosed with autism (Aspergers) 3 years ago. This was when I was describing to my psychiatrist about how when I talk to people, my mind blanks out and I'm unable to carry a conversation. He suggested I research autism and see if it applies to me. I did one of those online quizzes and passed. I remember that the things I related to were struggling in social situations and preferring to be alone sometimes.nnRecently, I've been reflecting on how I was diagnosed. As well as this, I have not found an autistic female that I relate to. I do not identify with many of the symptoms, like stimming, repetitive behaviours, special interests, info-dumping, or struggling with body language. I'd actually say I'm hyperaware of other people's body language when interacting with them with how they're reacting to what I'm saying. This a well as many, many other factors has lead me to believe I actually have social anxiety. I also have POTS, chronic fatigue, and body dysmorphic disorder relating to my face (my skin specifically), which complicates things with overlapping. I spoke to my psychologist about the possible misdiagnosis, and she agreed that from all the times she has seen me, she didn't see me as having ASD.nnThe main problem is my mum. She found she was autistic after my diagnosis and was very passionate about how we were the same. I brought up my concern with the diagnosis last night and she got very angry with me, talking about herself and how she had wasted 17 years of her life on me. She is completely convinced I'm autistic.nnThis whole thing had made me feel rejected. I really don't feel well mentally. I guess the point of this post is to ask what the difference between social anxiety and autism is. Any advice about what I should do would be appreciated."

I have no one to talk to cause even my family believe that I am faking my illness cause I don't want to work. nnI don't find anything interesting.

The only way I get to see her is by paying her to send me selfies.  nnI just feel like I cannot achieve anything in life and am just going nowhere.

My parents don't care about mental health and think that I'm just making excuses. No matter how hard I try, for some reason I can't approach people, start conversations, speak loudly and clearly, and even sit or stand near others including my family. My parents know I have issues with socializing, but instead of seeing a psychologist or taking it seriously, they just get mad at me and say ""YOU'RE ALREADY 19 HOW THE FUCK DO YOU STILL NOT KNOW HOW TO SOCIALIZE?!?!?!"". nnAnyways, so like I said I must get a job by September this year or else I will be homeless so I applied for many jobs near me and got rejected by the vast majority. I did however get accepted to train at Target and I already did two days of job orientation, and other two days of job training (I have four days left). Yesterday I was doing everything on my own and it was a disaster; I kept on making mistakes, especially when  customers come up to be and ask me for help, I don't know what to do because first of all, I'm new and no one has trained me to guide customers, but more importantly I have trouble talking to them and even when I speak as loud as I can, they still can't hear me. There is just no way I can get this job like that.nnSo I really need help finding a job that doesn't involve much socialization and also don't require any degrees, certifications, licenses, work experience, and operating motor vehicles (I don't have a driver's license)."

It’s not necessarily a stabbing pain, but it feels like something is just constantly pressing down on my ribs most of the time. I will focus on it pretty hard and it probably makes it worse. I have this at work, hanging out with family, my best friends, going out in public, etc. The only time I don’t have this problem is when I am at home or laying down relaxing, which is why I believe it’s anxiety related. I asked my therapist and she thinks it’s from not breathing deep enough but I’ve been trying hard to focus on my deep breathing and it hasn’t helped at all. It’s frustrating because it’s uncomfortable and it’s what I focus on at work and when having conversations. I’m about to go to the doctor because im sick of it.

I’m also fed up because my friends (aged around 23) are getting on with their lives, getting good jobs, graduating, getting their first house. I feel like I’m miles behind everyone else as I’ve not done the things they were doing five or six years ago. I’ve never been anywhere other than my nearest town on my own, or anywhere at all with friends. The furthest I’ve gone is to the park to play football a few times.

7231,"alongquestion","post","Do you feel like social anxiety has made you empathetic?","Not too long ago I had a bad experience at the bank. I was there to replace my lost debit card. I just turned 19 and had no idea what I was doing. This was my first time going to the bank without my parents. I walked in and a woman behind the counter looked me in the eyes and smiled at me, then started walking towards her desk as I approached. Naturally, I thought she was gesturing towards me. I walked over to her station and she said ""Oh, this woman is in line - you will have to wait your turn"". And she pointed to a woman sitting over 10 feet away, nowhere near the desk. In that moment I got so embarrassed that I didn't know what to do. I said, oh yeah I just have a question for you guys. I could tell she started getting irritated that I was still talking. I said, ""Sorry I just don't have a lot of time"" to try and justify me talking. I think it came across as me being entitled, like I was in a hurry so other people didn't matter. When in reality I was trying to explain myself because I was so embarrassed. She took my name and told me to sit down in the waiting room, but I snuck out the door and ran to the exit with my face probably beet red. nnThis got me thinking about how I have become overly sensitive to other people's needs over the years. Every time people misinterpret me, I feel like it makes me that much more empathetic to what other people are going through. Whenever someone else was mistreated or is having a difficult time, I wallow in it just like it's my own pain. It has made me realize how bad it is to judge other people based on how they act in public. I have always been socially clumsy, and I think it's so important to give other people grace in those areas. We never know what types of mental health issues someone is going through. People assume that if you don't act like the default, you are rude or just have an unlikeable personality. I don't understand why we still think this way when 1 in 5 Americans are currently struggling with a mental health disorder. Most mental health conditions do impact the way you socialize. I also find that I get along best with people who have similar struggles. Can anyone else relate?"

Those include the way my friends think of me because I’ve grown up surrounded by people who have constantly torn me down emotionally. nnThis brings me to what I’m nervous about. nnSo surprisingly, I am a theatre student and I adore theatre, music, and acting. During a production I was in with a large group of close friends with a company I have a deep connection to, me and two other campers (it’s a theatre camp) began practicing harmonies for both our show and for fun. I only participated a few times and not for very long (10 minutes at the longest). It was fun and the two kids I was doing it with were pretty talented and could hold their pitch so it sounded really good. The problem was, we were doing this in a pretty open place that had a few other people doing makeup, talking, and preparing for the shows. nnIt didn’t sound bad and at the time I didn’t think it was embarrassing because no one was telling us to stop and no one was saying anything (we actually got some complements). I understand that maybe we shouldn’t have been close to others and could’ve taken our space but I didn’t understand until after that people thought we were embarrassing. nnMy two close friends told me a couple days ago on FaceTime that they could not stand it and that they were so embarrassed. I immediately began thinking back through everything and replaying who heard us and tried to figure out if anyone tried to tell me to stop. Now I literally feel like I ruined my last year in that camp and my chances of being a counselor because my friends thought I was annoying. nnI haven’t felt that awful in a long time and I ended up self harming for the first time in a while. It may not seem like a big deal or enough to do that over but it was to me."

I’m now 24 married and need to get my life together but can’t get past these panic attacks I don’t even know why it is happening. I’ve tried 3 different therapists over the last 5 years and I’m personally not a fan as they did not help at all. I’ve also been prescribed daily anxiety meds which I was on for a year with the dosage going up throughout the year but they never worked either. ANYONE pls help especially if you’ve gone through this and i feel so alone and no one understands and makes me feel crazy or lazy when I wish nothing more to have a steady paying job and life especially for my wife. its getting to the point i just want to give up on life ."

I see other people, IRL and online, talking about their friends and socializing and planning social events, etc and atp in my life, I'm not even jealous. Just depressed.nnIt's heartbreaking knowing I'm never going to have that. I've had severe SA since I was 9 (I suspect earlier but that's when I was diagnosed) and I'm 19 rn. I've wasted my entire teenagehood not being able to be...normal. Have friends or just talk to people. I didn't have any friends, no coming of age story, not even comfort. I was uncomfortable 24/7 being in school and knowing I'd have to go back when I wasn't there.nnI spent time with therapists and by myself, trying to figure out ways for me to cope or self improve, whatever and it never worked. My SA is rarely self talk, ""a little voice"" as they say, it's just an intrinsic, deep feeling in my gut, like I just committed a mortal sin, literally just from talking, I can't tell it to shut up. I tried self improvement and to others, that did work; I exercise regularly now (sometimes obsessively, it's sort of a coping mechanism for me), meditate, take care of myself, etc. And that's great and all, but it doesn't make it any easier to talk to people.nnI want this to be over. These days, unless I'm drowning out my thoughts with music or whatever, I constantly think about my childhood. I was so social when I was little. The only time I ever had a friend was when I was 7, and I constantly think about them. I miss that so fucking much. I miss being ""normal""... Aka, not this."

I know for many of us (even if it sounds grim), it's a case of recognizing and accepting that this is a disorder we just have to find ways around to be able to live with and that treatments and talking about it with a therapist doesnt always help or cure anything. nnSo, I was wondering, What have you guys tried of treatments and ways to gain some relief from this nightmare? What has helped you or worked out and what hasn't? nn&amp;#x200B;nnPersonally I've nn* \-talked with a health person at my school - didn't helpn* Talked with two different psychologist. didn't help but taught me how my anxiety works and how it affects men* Been tested for ADD - Didn't helpn* Cognitive behaviour therapy - didn't help but taught me how my anxiety works and how it affects men* Tried ""toughening up"" - didn't help obviouslyn* Tried getting myself together - doesn't workn* Talked with school adviser - didn't helpnnFor me, currently, I use breathing techniques and trying to improve on feeling confident, and going for walks, + working out a couple times a week, and being open about how I feel and what my limits are.nnCurious to hear your attempts!"

I can get hard and all that so there’s of course attraction there, and there’s no pressure or anything that i feel about performing, it’s just the act itself for some reason feels incredibly forbidden and wrong, like it’s something i shouldn’t be doing. i’m sure this is the reason for the nausea, but WHY does it feel like it’s forbidden? i want to enjoy myself. i want to just have fun. is there any way to get rid of this? or do i have to just accept defeat and never have sex again? it’s gotten so bad that sometimes i can’t even hang out with a girl and have there be no sexual intention in our time we hang out and i still get nauseous. i’m so broken, this has taken full control of my life."

I remember times where I'd have pretty chill days at work or school where I rationally knew nothing bad even happened, and then I'd still get anxious and upset anyway just because the strain of ""acting natural"", trying to be friendly, and continuously doing the dozens of tiny things everyone else takes for granted was still such a burden."

Both therapists have openly agreed that I do have severe Social Anxiety disorder and tried to help me. This is after detailed testing so not just a conclusion out of the box and I have discussed every possible detail/symptom of my life with them.nn*Anyway on to the problem*nnOne of my problems recently as I've gone back to university and used a combination of CBT and ACT techniques for my **social anxiety** (under supervision from my therapist) is that if I get panicky or anxious (and again this is just blushing **a lot,** sometimes shaking and my muscles tightening up and stuttering and being a bit anti-social) is that fellow student who are not even psychology majors or have such a background are openly comparing me (and then telling others) that I'm autistic (again based on what are actually symptoms of my Social Anxiety, but they don't know that).nnI'm really trying to do exposure and acceptance but if I keep fighting my anxiety it backfires, yet now I'm afraid to show symptoms of Anxiety in the first place because of what keeps happening. So the anxiety returns 100x more.nnI'm not going to pretend to have something I don't have and can't really relate to (there is a guy who actually has it in my class and is open about it, ironically enough people didn't think of it him until he said it), which has many other symptoms and frankly it makes me even more depressed and insecure and misunderstood. My issues simply do not come, however you look at it from the same cause and I'm not going to lie and pretend even more that I have Autism when I don't!nnAlso as a straight guy, it means that girls who initially liked me are being told by other girls about my 'diagnosis' and I'm already noticing different looks from them.nnIt makes me feel very depressed and hopeless and not at all accepting of my Social Anxiety. Not only do I need to battle my Social Anxiety but I'm also being misidentified with something I don't have.nnAnybody have any solutions?nnAgain no disrespect intended, it's not a case of denying something.. Uninformed people who think blushing or being anti-social or just very socially anxious in the first place are spreading opinions about me."

I know my boundaries, and what I need to do with my social anxiety. For instance I need time alone to process my thoughts, I need to take my medicine every day, I need to take care of myself physically. Outside of the house, it’s like the Wild West. I am not a normal person who can just go out shopping without breaks in the car or by myself somewhere. I have to listen to my body and make sure I don’t panic, and usually, sometime in the outing, I feel extreme despair.nnNow I don’t drive long distances either. I don’t drive on highways (I have, for a college commute, but I had to practice for it and I don’t anymore). I have to drive for 2 hours on a highway into a city I’ve never been to for this trip. It makes me feel light headed just thinking about it. I’m going to practice tomorrow, but if I can’t do it I don’t know what I’ll do. nnMy friend is from high school (I’m 23) and doesn’t understand social anxiety. She tries to lift me up, but she believes that you can push through anything, that independent is the best thing you can be. That mental illness like depression can be fought through on willpower alone. She’s gotten better about this over the years, but I think a part of her refuses to accept that some things require professional help. nnI’ve never met her friends, she met them in college. My friend has been known to favor people over me (I know. She used to be very insecure and I think focuses/idolizes on people who she admires or wants to be like) and I fear there will be no support for me out there. That’s a whole other thing that I’m embarrassed about, as I am an adult and have made great progress since high school, but I still want (need? Haven’t figured it out) people close to me to respect my struggles and symptoms. nnAll three of them have graduated and have jobs. I’m dreading the polite questions about what I do. I’m going through undiagnosed pain and severe depression because of it. I can’t hardly leave my bed. My anxiety is paralyzing. nnI struggle with eating and sleeping around new people, and now with my pain I fear I’ll put myself in pain out of anxiety of holding back the group. And then have to drive home in pain. nnI really want to go because I know it won’t be as bad as I fear it being, and because I want to test my anxiety and have new experiences, but OH MY LORD, I am freaking out. nnJust had to get that out there, to people who understand.

I recently graduated high school after completing summer school to finish my classes. I’ve been at home because I’m taking a gap year before community college and I applied for a Dog Bather job the other day. They called me back yesterday and I scheduled an appointment for today. On the phone the lady said they usually prefer someone with some experience (which I did not realize when I applied) but they would still consider hiring me. Shortly after the call, she emailed me with the information for the interview and it’s making me really anxious and regret doing this. It was a document the the main thing that caught my eye is that it said you must leave your phone in your car…and I have someone driving me there and back home who I need to communicate with and I also feel really unsafe not having my phone with me in public. And there was a part specifically saying to give a handshake and “good eye contact” upon arrival and to thank the interviewer for having me when I leave, which I would do anyway (at least attempt with the eye contact), but the fact that it’s written in a document makes me feel like it’s a performance that I have to remember and it gives me a lot of anxiety. There’s also the fact that I didn’t realize that it said I had to reply to the email ASAP to confirm the interview until just now. But I already scheduled it yesterday on the phone. I feel like I can’t go back now because I don’t want to be rude and cancel the same day and I don’t want to disappoint my parents but I really don’t know what to do."

It sucks because I’m an extrovert and I gain energy by talking to people and making other people happy but as soon as I’m alone or even while I’m talking to people I can’t help but think of what I did wrong. I think everyone hates me, all the time. I think it’s been not only effecting my emotions (intense sadness, overthinking, self loathing etc.) but my diet as well. Every time I try to eat I’ll either take a few bites or look at it and suddenly I’ll get full. For a good while I could barely shower and I still struggle to brush my teeth. The only reason I do is out of fear of everyone judging me. I feel like eyes are always on me, I just can’t relax. Not even at home.nnI guess I’m not looking for help, I just want to not feel alone if that makes any sense. Reddit is really the only place I can get unbiased advice without going to a therapist.

The most ironic thing is that a guy in my class who actually has it but is not shy and is open about it, nobody knew it for months before he said it.nnI got tested twice in detail (one did weekly observation for around 2 Months because I wanted to be really sure for once and for all) and know I'm not on it, not even on the lightest level. my symptoms also are not caused by those issues and don't match the rest of my life or my childhood which was relatively Anxiety free, not to mention the problems disappear 100% when I have no anxiety.nn(nothing against people who are actually on it and I could have accepted it if I had it. I know some people have both. It's just hard to accept something you don't have, you wouldn't start acting like you have Diabetes when you don't have Diabetes.)nnBut this has led to a whole new chain of events in which people consider me incapable, they tell other people about the 'autistic' guy, I don't get replies from texts, don't get invited to parties because people talk down the line and have made assumptions about me, my opinions on social issues/emotional issues are not taken seriously or people try to talk to me in a very factual way or even play jokes that don't work with me.. I get the stares when Autism is discussed in my social studies class.nnWhen making friends some people are nice about my Anxiety, but then talk to others behind my back that I have a disorder with symptoms I don't have and have never shown. One girl even admitted she saw Atypical and because that guy looked anxious in class, I must have it.nnIt's made me really really depressed and has hindered my exposure therapy because I don't want to show Anxiety now at university (even though I barely move my muscles, and don't even feet tap like a lot of people with no Anxiety even do.. I show or feel none of the traditional Autism symptoms and it doesn't relate to the rest of my life)nnWhat's worse is that I am known as a person with the rare old friends I have and family members.

Personally i think this has nothing to do with my social anxiety but more with possibly yet to be diagnosed autism. Like in group projects, people come with all these ideas but my mind just blanks. And it's not like in those moments I'm thinking 'oh gosh I'm not saying anything, I could say this but that would be stupid' or that my mind is preoccupied with other things like not blushing and stuff. It's literally that nothing pops up. No ideas. Empty mind. nnSame goes for conversations. Sometimes in conversations though I will be curious about certain things like 'I wonder what their favorite animal is' but I have nooo idea how to get to there without asking questions out of the blue, so I just keep silent. nnAnd just now I realised that when I'm trying to write a story, I also don't know what characters could say. And it's not like I'm socially anxious about those characters, I'm not in that story, so how could my social anxiety influence what my character might or might not say (I mean obviously it can influence it but in this instance it's more of a 'I don't know what they could say cause I wouldn't know what to say'). And it's not that it's just for the shy characters in my story, cause obviously for them it might be fitting that they don't know what to say. It's also for the stronger and more talkative characters. nnAnyway, whole ramble, if anyone has any thoughts about this please let me know:)"

It’s classical singing and was pretty dramatic but our Lecturer wanted more expression and emotion. I happened to be sitting the front row by myself for anxiety reasons and was bobbing my head really hard and the lecturer asked me to come up, who was in his first year therennI really awkwardly stood up and packed some shit away for what seemed like forever and this girl was getting very jokey about it. I know she was trying to lighten the mood cause I was obviously nervous, but it just made me more nervous so that was coolnnI was told to look into her eyes and turn away if she wasn’t giving enough emotion. What was really awkward was that I didn’t really turn away because she was so captivating until my lecturer sorta turned me away ( awkward ). And then so had to give the right time to turn back sbd way, but I feel like I did it way too little and walked around to the other side to get her to chase me. It was like this for 10 minutes and thankfully I’ve been to therapy for this kinda stuff, do I wasn’t shutting and pissing and shaking in my pants and was just slowly drumming at my leg to get fantastic singing. nnAnyways I clasped with everyone else when she finished and they thanked me etc. I talked to people afterwards and they said that I should’ve enjoyed it more, and that I looked a bit dead, but considering that it was end of the afternoon and I had a really awkward encounter in the afternoon I was just glad that even though I’m going to be haunted about it for the next month, I did it :)nnSorry for venting, just wanted somewhere to chill w/"

During covid lockdowns I made an effort to start going to therapy (online) and getting on medication. Because of this my anxiety has lessened to a certain degree, at least physically. Recently I have realized how much of social anxiety is a mental thing. I feel dumb for not realizing sooner considering it is a mental illness, but to me it’s always been more noticeable physically. Anyone else feel the same way? Feel the opposite?"

I don’t think it’s a big deal but it’s just those little things…nnI met a bunch of girls when I stayed at a treatment/recovery center. Fast forward a year. We live in different places but remained friends on Instagram. I didn’t really talk to them, so my brain convinced me to delete all of them because “I’m a private person” but in retrospect I honestly think it’s because I was afraid of expressing myself and possibly being judged since I’m more outspoken online, whereas the version they saw of me IRL was pretty shy. It’s like I’m afraid to be who I want to be online. So my brain was constantly telling me that I was being judged, that they think I’m full of myself, they hate me, etc. nnYet one of them reached out to me but I barely engaged because I already believed that I was “beneath” her, so here I am wishing I had friends, yet I become too overwhelmed by my insecurities so I lose themnnI feel like “normal” people don’t even think twice about that stuff… like they would’ve just continued to follow each other without much thought. Idk I just wish I didn’t unfollow because now I feel lonelier but it’s whatever because I don’t want who I follow on social media to matter that much. Just a petty frustration nnEven recently one of my friends from high school moved back to my state and I reached out to her to hang out, which she wanted to do, but again, my brain… just makes it so hard. Now I feel like she thinks I’m playing games with her because I genuinely try to hang out but end up flaking because I’m scared, but I don’t want to not reach out because I don’t want them to think I don’t want to be friends nnI don’t want to give up.

Any time that someone tries to start a conversation with me (or even greets me casually) my body behaves as if I'm in a life or death situation, I go into fight or flight and come off as super awkward/creepy. This has had serious negative affects on my mental and physical health.

Talking about it hasn't helped me as most people don't quite understand what social anxiety is. Generally they think it's a choice I'm making or that I just don't like talking to people. As depressed as I am and as much as I think about su!cide I'm pretty sure I'm too stubborn to actually ever clock out so there's that. nnIf anyone with similar experience could offer assistance that doesn't involve an appointment with some expensive ""doctor"" who will tell me what all my feelings mean and how to spit out pre-written responses in social situations like a robot, I would greatly appreciate it."

School was a living nightmare and I spent years isolating myself from people, so buried in all the fears my SA told me that I didn't believe recovery was possible. I don't need to list all the ways SA made me feel trapped - you already know - but I spent so many years not talking to people that, even when I wanted to recover, I didn't think I even knew *how to.* I didn't know how to have a conversation with a stranger anymore.nnBut I'm happy to say it's been a few years since that point. Moving to university was something I was so excited yet terrified to do because as much as I wanted a fresh start I was convinced I'd fall back into old patterns of isolation. But after being lucky enough to get access to a therapist for around 8 months I started to be able to heal. nnI've made some great friends at university and for the first time in my life I finally feel like I can be myself in a way I didn't think was possible. I can *talk* to people. Even doing simple things like being able to say hello to my classmates or buying something in a shop was something I couldn't even dream of doing at one point, let alone going to social events with the intention of meeting new people! I've had friends be shocked when I've told them I had SA and people ask me how I have the confidence to do certain things, and after spending so much of my life wanting to ask the same question, it's wild to be on the receiving end. (Although, my answer is often a combination of therapy and dying my hair bright pink - having a unnatural hair colour forced me out of my comfort zone and made me learn how to tolerate being \~perceived\~ very quickly!)nnIt's definitely not completely gone, I still get waves of panic and I don't even know where to begin with thinking about giving in person presentations but I'm not planning my life around avoidance. Somehow, sheer stubbornness has allowed me to not let SA stop me from doing things I want to do and my life is so much better for it.nnThis got longer than I intended but since I genuinely never believed i would get to this point I wanted to share. Recovery is possible and one day you'll be able to do the things you'd like to do. I'm sending all my love to everyone in this subreddit, your success stories inspired me to create my own &lt;33"

I'm too scared to do anything to the point where my days and nights are spent inside, headphones on to drown out the voices. I'm on medication (its main effect is numbness, but I'm too scared to mess around with medications at the moment, because of recent attempts that had negative physical consequences, and because honestly I'm so scared to be in that vulnerable state where it might not work), been in weekly therapy for almost 10 years, I know what feels like all of the mental techniques, I know what I should be doing to challenge my anxiety. nnNo one left in my life really understands what's going on with me, how demoralizing it is to know/feel that there is no true fix to this, that even if I do everything by the book, my heart will still race when I enter a grocery store, my hands will shake, I'll struggle to look at people in the eye, shoulders caving inwards. I lose the ability to think out of sheer, blinding, irrational fear. Every social interaction in any form is a survival situation and that fact makes me want to scream, because I want nothing more than to see and care for people, to experience life and not fear the single social misstep that will send me spiraling. nnI'm at my wit's end. There are so many distortions in my thinking (and I'm coming to realize, emotional trauma) that I literally have no idea how to start unravelling without breaking myself apart and honestly it doesn't seem worth it. This is not a life worth struggling for and I know because I've struggled to make it right literally since I was first aware of myself as a person. These past few months have really knocked me down. nnAnd you know what, I'm sick of some people not acknowledging social anxiety for what it really is: debilitating. I can't tell you have many jokes have been made at my expense because I couldn't stand up for myself and it's so wrong. Social anxiety's ruined my life, and what's worse is that I don't know if it's my fault or not. nnThere's so much more I could write, all the pain that I've caused others, the guilt, the constant self-analysis, *questioning reality*, the physical symptoms--this illness is a horrible web.

I am hoping that there may be some insights here that can help, because so far medication/therapy hasn't been particularly helpful (currently I'm looking for a new therapist). My apologies in advance for the length of this, I have so much on my mind and it's just sort of pouring out. nnI am a 24 year old female, and moved from CA to New England in February to study at a premedical post-bacc program (I was a psych major as an undergrad, but realized I wanted to become a doctor during my senior year). It's kind of a weird situation, because I'm older than the undergrads in my current classes, and around the same age as the graduate students. In spring all classes were remote, so coming back in person for the fall semester has been so, so weird and awkward, to say the least.nnI was diagnosed with GAD at 11, then MDD, ADHD and later social phobia in high school. I've never had many friends, and was bullied a lot as an adolescent, which led me to start hiding in bathrooms at lunch time/avoiding making social plans/etc.. I've never been in a romantic relationship, either. nnAt home, my father was both verbally and at times physically abusive.  I have two older brothers, but we have pretty big age difference  (with 6 &amp; 10 years, respectively) and have never been terribly close. My mom was by far my biggest advocate growing up, and helped me get the care I needed when I was first experiencing symptoms. She was extremely social, and just one of those magnetic people that everyone loves being around. She didn't really understand why I was so fearful of others because of her extroverted personality, but still made every effort to support me.  She sadly passed away from brain cancer when I was 17. nnI feel insecure about my appearance a lot of the time, due to having scoliosis and a form of alopecia (my hair loss is still in an okay place but definitely worsening). nnI was struggling a lot during the pandemic at home in CA, when it became clear to me just how distant I had grown from the few friends I did have. Everyone was pursuing new jobs, grad school and other exciting endeavors, and I just felt left in the dust. I've always felt like I cared so much more about my friends (because of the precious few of them I had) and enjoyed spending time with them, more than they did  me. Because of this, I felt more comfortable isolating myself, than risking feeling as though I was wasting anyone's time or feeling rejected. This just put more distance between myself and everyone else, and made it so that when opportunities to socialize did come up, I didn't know how to act. I just feel fundamentally unlikeable. nnI had to stop seeing the psychiatrist I had been seeing for years in CA once I left, and when they didn't really say anything at the end of our last meeting (acknowledging the time they had been treating me, wishing me well, etc.), for some reason I felt even worse. I felt like I had just annoyed them with my awkwardness. Nevertheless, as pathetic as it sounds, I miss the consistency of  having someone to talk to monthly. nnWhen I first moved back East, I enjoyed being in school from the comfort of home, experiencing real winter weather for the first time, and decorating my apartment in the way I had always dreamed of. But now that months have gone by, and I've only really had one real social gathering with the people in my cohort of post-bacc students, I feel so empty. It is so hard to find it in myself to even do basic things like keeping my apartment clean and personal hygiene (my ADHD definitely factors into this. I eat mostly takeout food, and spend 99% of the time alone. I feel incompetent every time I talk to anyone, and feel like my awkwardness just spills over into whatever I'm doing. I've tried asking the people in my cohort over text if they were free, but no plans ever were made. We laugh and are nice to each other in person when class is going on, but that's really the extent of it.nnI've mentioned that I'm struggling to several friends from home, but none of them really say anything in response except that they are sorry/don't follow up with me about how I'm doing. They only seem to want to talk when something exciting is happening in their lives (I have several friends applying to/starting med school, etc. ). I try my best to show my enthusiasm and support for them, but it just makes me feel worse/left behind.nnMy family doesn't follow up either, and just reaching out to people to complain about the pathetic state of my life, I imagine,  would be off-putting. I started seeing a new psychologist in February,  which again was nice to have in my schedule regularly, but recently decided to try to find a new one that I could connect with more. I felt like I wasn't being completely honest about everything going on/was saying what I thought would get them to like me. (Totally not the point of therapy)nnAt the moment, I'm sitting on my couch, scrolling through my instagram feed and crying because I am wasting my life. I just want to make friends, go out /date like my 20something peers do. I want to find people who care about me just as much as I do them, be ""likeable"" and feel fulfilled. I just don't know where to begin.  I'm thinking of getting a cat or some other small animal to keep me company, until things maybe get better.

By July, I started work at a big hospital in clinical research. The work I've done there is so interesting and excites me to no end. I have conducted studies that will help so many people and it all makes me feel great. But I have severe social anxiety and of course communicating with coworkers and the WELL established doctors there is quite hard. I'm terrible at it and the way it ends up going pains me but I function okay enough to get by (I'm sure everyone finds me awkward). The latest study I am working on I've done entirely by myself, aside from working with a doctor I have a lot of respect for for his approval on my collected data. That means I combed through thousands of reports and scans, as well as producing my own readings, volumes, and statistical analyses. This study is my baby. I mention all this because it should be so easy to write about. Well now comes the time to write the research paper for publishing in a big medical journal and it's NOT easy. I've written a lot of research papers through my years of education... but this one has made me so anxious and it's all due to social/professional anxiety regarding my doctor colleague reading what I write. I'm jittery, sweaty, at a loss for words every time I try to write. I even know what a good paper looks like but my brain stops functioning as I begin to write and then I go blank with worry over being up to standards. I made the mistake of reading other original research papers published by the journal for guidance and I think ""Okay, that sounds perfect. How do (a 21 y/o) replicate the work of 35-60 y/o doctors)"" and then I have the words they wrote in my head but of course I'm not trying to plagiarize. So much anxiety over this and it should be easy. nnDoes anyone have any serious advice for how to get over this?

Although i only came out with my social anxiety and how hard it is coming to school and paying attention. I didnt tell her about my depression or suicidal thoughts. Her advice was very vague to tell the truth, all she said was power through the year because there isnt much she can do about my social anxiety (which makes sense, she isnt a wizard).nnBut i have a hard time attending school, even the school police came to house. Because in all honesty i can't come, school takes such a mental toll on me that i cant even show up. Of course this is affecting my grades as im failing most of my classes. nnI haven't been to school in like 2 weeks, i usually sneak my way past my parents until they leave for work, then i stay at home. But today and tomorrow my dad isnt going to work so i was forced to show up to school. I feel so much anxiety as im currently typing this. Anyways i want to talk to my counselor again but this time through email, because i personally can express and explain things better through text and writing as i have a hard time speaking and expressing my thoughts irl. I want to email my counselor and tell her i want to do online school and if theres any way she can convince my parents to do so (im not close to my parents nor my family so its hard opening up). And then i want to open up and elaborate on my mental more because again i can explain things better through text. I want to tell her i hate in person school,  it takes a toll on my mental health, my current mental health problems,  and how its the only way I'll graduate.nnAny advice for me? What else should i include in the email? And do you think this is a good choice? I want as much insight as possible :("

I’m 22 and I recently moved out from my family home to study. I tried to make some friends in university and I even hang out with a few people one night, but I don’t feel part of their group, I feel like they hang out together and I just joined them that night because I asked, of course I can ask them again but in this way I won’t know if they really want to go out with me. Also the fact that when I’ m with them I’m always nervous and I don’t know what to say doesn’t help, and I don’t think I’m being myself either because I want so desperately them to like me. So I feel alone here because I don’t feel like they are my friends and I don’t know if they will ever be and I’ve no one in my home town either, except my family, because I managed to push all my old friends away. This is my situation, it sucks , I really want to create meaningful friendships but when I’m around new people I’m really anxious and I never know what to say and how to express my opinions. I feel stuck because I tried to put myself in situations where I was around new people and my anxiety have not improved at all.

I can’t really explain it but it’s their tone and also what they talk about. One time I walked with them and my roommate was talking to his friend about this girl he wanted to ask out but he didn’t want me to know about it. This is just one example, but I feel like this happens to me all the time and I can’t really blame them. I am 18 and I have never dated or even had a first kiss, never went to a party or drank/smoked, never really did anything of that sort. I know it’s silly for me to want to do these things just for the sake of doing.

It's turns out I've had severe social anxiety disorder my entire life, I've always been aware I've had these problems but I've always stuck my head in the sand. I can't even explain what it feels like to put a name to the villain I've been facing all these years and to hear others are going through the same thing. I wish I had done this years ago, it feels great to listen to your stories, every single one resonates with me and I feel your pain. I don't feel as though I have to hate myself for the mental ticks I have anymore because I can truthfully say it's a mental disorder and there's nothing I can do to stop them, I just need to move past it. To those suffering the same problems as me my best advice is to keep moving into the deep end, constant exposure to my fears has allowed me to live an almost normal life.

I live in a dorm with 35 other teenage boys and It took me a good eight months before I knew all of them.

Two of my coworkers who bagged for me would always laugh at me. Many of the other baggers would literally just avoid me by always bagging for another cashier.

A lot of women have attempted to talk to me but when I do weird shit with my face they just back off. It's just that my facial expressions steer people away and because it happens so frequently, I don't have much confidence. So with all that being said, I'd like to get a job again because I need the money. I really would like to work a electronics retail store or a restaurant, but if I do end up applying to either, I'm afraid I'm going to experience the same miserableness and humiliation I had at my last job due to their social nature. What do I do? I really need to start attacking this issue now because if I don't it's just going to catch up to me when I graduate and pursue my career. "

Today I'm going to make friends! Today I'm going to be sociable!"" But the moment I step into school, all of a sudden the weight hits me. In that moment I'm small, weak, and I just want to be alone. In class I'll position myself somewhere far from everyone. Where I won't be noticed. All while secretly wishing for a friend to talk to. There are some people who I'm somewhat comfortable around; people I've known long enough to the able to interact with without too much fear. But even then, they'll only talk to me because we're in the same class. They show no interest in talking to me elsewhere, and I don't blame them. I'm unattractive, boring, and I couldn't hold a conversation to save my life. I guess I'm to blame for my lack of social skills. nnSchool is the worst thing in my life, but it's the only time I'll ever leave my home. The only things I have to look forward to are new episodes of shows I enjoy. To top it off my English class has speeches coming up, and English is my weakest subject...

Hiding my pathetic self from the world. It's strange. When I'm alone, I long for human interaction. But around others I become extremely self-conscious. I'm policing every action I perform, I sweat, blush, and feel ill. It's exhausting, and I want to be alone. Leaving me exactly where I started. It's a cruel cycle, and I do it to myself.

I am a 24 year old male that is stuck in a rut and can't seem to get out. There is a persistent belief of mine that I cannot dispel. It asserts that I cannot speak nor write coherently, either to myself or to others. I have become conscious of my speech and writing to an absurd degree. The effort to think up of words in a conversation by itself sometimes causes problems (slurring, skipping a word, etc...). It would be as if a dancer became obsessed with the steps of their feet, and consequently, constantly trips and falls. I have attributed this to OCD, which I was diagnosed in fourth grade. At that point in my life, speaking was not a big concern of mine. nnThis over consciousness surrounding speech and writing became a dilemma when I was eighteen. This happened after years of bullying in high school. In addition, life at my dad's house was always anxiety provoking. He was, and still is, fond of yelling and stomping his feet so as to get his word in. I believe these two things act as the foundation of my current fear. nnSo, what do you think about this? Same experiences, possible solutions?nnPS: I almost forgot to mention that, yes, I do feel anxiety around people.nnPSS: I apologize if I come across the wrong way.

7686,"ChanceVance","post","I've struggled with social anxiety for years. Where do I go from here? [Long Read]","I’m 22 years old. I’ve never had a job or been in a relationship and undoubtedly a lot of that is a direct result of my social anxiety that has let my fear and doubts control me. I excessively overthink just about everything and as soon doubt creeps into my mind I either back out of it or I go ahead with whatever I’m afraid to do but it’s clear the doubts are still weighing heavily in my mind and it affects me. I’ve seen a psychologist before which wasn’t very successful but am exploring that option again but would just like some advice from people who have lived through the same anxiety I feel.  nI’ve gotten to a point where I feel life is starting to pass me by. Everyone around me seems to have everything right while I still struggle with seemingly simple things. It has made me extremely frustrated with myself leading to a lot of self-hate and that repeating cycle of trying, failing, criticizing myself and avoidance time and again. I know there’s so much wrong with me and can recognize my own destructive thought patterns but I feel helpless to do anything about it. I feel like changing myself for the better requires me to fight harder than I’ve ever fought for anything in my life but I just don’t believe I have the strength to do it. What can someone like me do to fix my anxiety before it really is too late?  nnA bit about myself. I am actually very self assured of my talents in the field of performing arts. I recently auditioned for a place in a film school and I was successful in getting in. I was a bit nervous but I told myself a lot that I could do this and I thought about all my previous positive experiences that helped me believed I could do it and so I did. I honestly never doubted myself. It is of little help to me in helping with my anxiety though because it’s mostly just confirmed to me in my mind that it’s the only thing I’ve ever done right and that I’m just not capable of functioning in a normal society.    nOne time I went out looking to hand my CV in at places and I really struggled with just the concept of asking about it. I said to myself “Should I have it in my hand when I go up there or should I keep it in my backpack”, “Are they going to be annoyed at yet another person asking about a job?”, “Why am I doing this? You know it’s not going to work” naturally this sort of thinking put me on edge.  I stuttered, used weird placement of words. At one place I simply just decided against asking and just walked away before I walked in. I’ve had an interview for a job since then and a job trial which I both failed. Not too bummed about it because they weren’t really jobs I particularly wanted anyway but it’s just a fact of life I need to find something soon and my anxiety is a big roadblock for that.nnI do have a small group of friends however it does seem to have shrunk a bit lately. I’m a loner and I don’t really like interacting with large groups of people a lot but there are a certain few people who I have built good connections with and am very comfortable with talking with them and sharing things with.      nI don’t see them too often anymore. They’re all very busy with their lives while I live out mine as an outcast in isolation. I see them at parties but recently one of my ‘friends’ who I’ve known for 6 years just plain stopped inviting me to their get-togethers. I was snubbed for their birthday party after 4 years without missing an invite to one and a Christmas one last year which I initially decided to overlook until the second snub. For that matter none of my other friends seem to find it odd that I’m not there like they didn’t expect me to be there anyway.    nBarring that one friend though I’m not questioning anyone else’s feelings towards me. I recently felt like I was being excluded earlier this year and drifting away before I promptly attended 3 straight 21st’s in 3 weeks. I still talk to them and they’re still happy to see me but I don’t get invited out to their nightlife outings. Honestly though I can’t blame them, I don’t drink alcohol (Unless it’s free) and I am often quiet and withdrawn at most parties I attend so I certainly don’t blame them for not inviting me out but it does make me feel like there’s a distinct lack of connection between them and myself because I don’t go out as much.  nIt’s given me a great deal of stress lately and I’ve decided to try and shut myself out of it like not checking my Facebook feed anymore because it frustrates me. I feel weird because I know to improve my social skills I really need to work on myself but to do that I need to remove myself from stressful situations like abstaining from social media and it makes me wonder if I’d be pushing myself away from them even further and lose contact with them because that’s how I get invites to things. Maybe it’s not the right way to go and I’m overthinking what I feel I should do. I don’t know whether to try harder to be more outgoing socially or accept we might be walking different paths in life.  nI think one reason I feel I should do that is in regards to one particular friend of mine. I fell in love with them a few years ago and well they didn’t return my feelings. We actually talked about it once because I simply felt I had to let those feelings be known. I’ve moved on from it and we’re still good friends amazingly but I distinctly notice whenever I notice this person getting cosy with someone else it really puts me on edge because it makes me wonder why I wasn’t good enough for them. I had to leave one of those 21st’s prematurely precisely because of the way it was making me anxious and I felt like there was nowhere for me to go other than out and away. Those strong feelings aren’t there but it’s like I never forget how much I felt personally rejected by them.nnOn the topic of relationships well I obviously struggle. I can approach people sometimes but the usual doubt and anxiety about my appearance and why they'd choose me when there's someone better out there usually sabotages that for me. I have very slowly made some improvements in my interactions with other people, I won't elaborate to save some space but am willing to open up more about it. It's the overthinking that kills me in that department and everywhere else.nnAnyway if you read it all then thanks, I’d appreciate any advice or experiences on how you might have solved your problems.

These issues have been culminating for a while now and I believe they are getting worse, despite me becoming arguably an all-around better person. I just thought that it was simply just being awkward and just gave it time to get better, and later just came to terms with it. But it's just been getting worse and worse and I can't see the logic behind the anxiety and self-consciousness, and yet its still very prevalent in my behavior. I care WAY too much about what people think of me, sometimes modelling my own personality because of it, and planning out conversations beforehand, in certain social scenarios I simply can't function, and I choke and murmur on my own words, and nothing I think ever comes out how I want it too. I've looked into subreddits like these and seen people with way more isolated and unfortunate childhoods like mine and they seem to be doing much better socially than me, even the ""weird"" kids at school are better at socializing than me.nJust recently, I've been suspecting that this may be way more than just shyness and awkwardness, and looked into mental illness. It seems highly probable that I have Social Anxiety Disorder, as I fit most of the major symptoms, but I don't want to fully rely on a self diagnosis. My parents thought will not let me see a therapist and they think it's just a teenager phase and won't pay a lot of money on something like that, but nobody else seems to have these issues to the extent that I do. All the friends I've talked to with this have urged me to get a real evaluation, but I have no idea how I can with my circumstances.nAnyone have any ideas?nnNote: Reposting this on this subreddit as it seems more fitting to my issue"

You know, the one who makes friends with everyone she talks to, is naturally hilarious, has a healthy social media presence, and lights up any room she enters into. That's just not going to be me. nnI don't know where things went wrong, so I'm not sure how to fix it. I've been told that I was more confident as a kid. I guess adolescence just fucked me over. nnI've tried all the conventional methods, like journaling, CBT, psychotherapy, even mindfulness exercises. I've gotten to the point where I'm just barely able to hold a conversation with a new person, and maybe throw in a few jokes here or there. Though the physical symptoms are no longer there, I still draw mental blanks and just have difficulty getting through social interactions. It never gets easier. Never. Maybe that's just as good as it's going to get and I have to accept that and not beat myself up over it. I'm 22, soon to be 23, for god's sake. This personality's cemented into me. "

Definitely can say I am a changed person as a result. However what I find weird is how much I feel like I change when I am on those drugs. I go from a quiet, funny guy who people don't expect much talk from to someone who feels like everything they have to say is word from Jesus himself. I think much deeper about things, and become a comedian, actor, therapist, artist, philosopher.My friends listen and think I say some crazy shit, but also some deep and interesting stuff. I usually lead my friends on the trips and even impress some of my friends who have been doing them longer with my ability to be so funny and have the most fun possible on the drugs. They usually end up telling me I should really do something with my life since people get famous and shit for no reason nowadays, and I seem like I could actually do something worthwhile in terms of comedy or acting. When I am not on them however, I feel like a lessened person. In that I mean, I feel the same physically, but mentally I am operating much slower and do not put things together as quickly. Do I need to start microdosing to reach my full potential in life or is there a slippery slope I am not thinking about? Any advice or comments help more than you know...nnEdit** when I am sober, I feel pretty lost in life and do not know what I want to do. I am rather introverted in the sense that I would rather chill at home in my bed than do a lot of things on most days.

For example, when i first started driving, i was nervous to go get gas by myself. However, i did get over that, so maybe i just need to stop overthinking and just make it a habit to do things on my own.

My mom sent me to a therapist (?) once to see if i should get on ADHD medication, but that was super stressful, and ended up not getting meds cause i just wanted to leave (i basically told him i dont think i need meds and im only here because my mom sent me. I lied about my social life, since i barely hang out with friends anymore.)nnI dont know whether i have ADHD thats causing anxiety, or if my anxiety is causing ADHD symptoms.nnHowever, the past week ive been taking small doses of dextroamphetamine (dexedrine), and its been making me more talkative and less awkward (ill say whatever i want to say without doubting myself).

The only thing im really comfortable with doing is buying food from the convenience store, but ive started eating better so i barely go outside.nnAlso, when i used to hang out with my friends more, id smoke weed with them often. However, my mom always demands me to be home at a certain time, so now being high makes me even more anxious when its supposed to make you relax.nnShes told me that if im ever high, i should have her come pick me up, but her attitude and actions make me unable to trust her, so ive driven home high before. Luckily, it was just down the street, and it was 9PM so there was little traffic, but its still not right. Last time i had my own weed, she went through my backpack without asking me, and found my paraphernalia and threw away my glass pipe. This was 2 years ago and now i try to avoid weed/hanging out with my friends, not because i want to, but because my mom is really scary when she finds out ive been doing something im not supposed to be doing.

I could see a future there for me. nnI have spoken at length with a few people who are familiar with my situation and have decided that my best route from here is to get another job that's a little less hectic and stressful, in addition to speaking with my doctor about readjusting my meds and counseling.

I've lived with my boyfriend for the past year and a half, but in a week, he's going to move back in with his parents who live two and a half hours away and work for his father, which means I'll be completely alone again and will probably spend the majority of my days in complete isolation. I'm incapable of holding a job, and have such horrible driving anxiety that I never drive anywhere. I walk to school, go to my classes, walk home, and call a taxi or get my boyfriend to drive me whenever I have to go somewhere I can't get to by foot, like a doctor's office or grocery store. I feel as if I'm incapable of functioning in society and my life feels like its in shambles; there are a few things I'm good at, but I don't really find joy in the things that used to bring me happiness so I'm starting to feel like ending all this pain would be better than suffering through a life of sadness, fear, and loneliness. I've been seeing a psychiatrist for the past 5 or so years, and have tried a plethora of anxiety medications with no success.

Exercising will only make me feel good right after and didn't really do anything for my moments of self-doubt. Seeing a therapist was nice to have someone to vent to but I found it hard to take any advice and actually utilize it. My parents were extremely opposed to medication and would never let me take even though my doctor highly suggested getting me started on some meds (no benzos like xanax though). Because I was a minor I couldn't decide on my own and I basically had to deal with the next three years on my own. It was fucking tough. I was miserable, I couldn't talk to people, I cried all of the time, and I hated myself. I'm 18 now and after finishing my first year of college realized I can't keep living like this anymore. I called my mom and told her whether she wanted me to or not I'm going to try to start medication (along with more therapy). I was tired and I knew it didn't work for everyone but I had to know if it's work for me. I wasn't expecting a change in personality, I just wanted my lows to stop being so low. I wanted to be able to go to the store without crying right after in my car and I wanted to be able to text old distant friends without feeling like I was annoying and a burden. I told her how strongly I felt about my anxiety and how I couldn't keep living like this. So, today, I went to the doctor, and I'll be starting Celexa. I just picked up my first fill and I'm happy.

In general, I am very open-minded, sociable person, have tons of friends in every ""society"" I currently am and really comfy talking to strangers, etc UNTIL recently which scares me. nnAround 5 month ago I started smoking weed(once a week, sometimes 2-3 week breaks) mainly with friends, co-workers or at a nightclubs with friends. Since then I have felt brain-fogged and kinda slow-thinking in general, but in the beginning, it was like 2 days after a session, afterwards everything went to it's original state. nnLast two month have been a personal nightmare of mine. Literally. nnThis feeling of brain dog haa been pretty rough and I blamed everything on weed citing it is an expected ""withdrawal"" of it. Basically I can no longer look at someone's eyes, because it gives me a strange feeling, worst part is I think either I am about to shit myself or have already. Of course, it never happened to me in reality, having this feeling for 3-4 month now, but when this mental attack strikes, that's the only thing I think about. I start sweating and that makes overall feeling even worse, due to my lower part of body becoming sweaty which leads me to think that ""that fatal thing"" happened to me. Strangely, this only occurs when I am on an exam(we have 1000+ ppl hall) and at my workplace 30+ pol, same room. Never haopened to me while at home, or with someone I have good comfort zone with, neither with any od my family members. nnRecently, I need 1-2hours falling asleep, compared to 5 mins max I used to need literally couple of months ago. And whenever I fall to sleep, heart races like crazy preventing me to sleep properly. nnnEven worse is that never knowing these symptoms are mostly leading to me having SAD, I thought it was withdrawal from weed and by now, am 1 month weed-feee but this feeling becomes even more intense. I start panicking about it like 7-12 timea a working shift which leads to worse results of mine at the workplace, let alone sitting on an exam, feeling full out of body(like extremely stoned) and rushing myself to quit the room ASAP without going through whatever I wrote on an exam. Also, broke up with gf mostly because I felt that was and was leaving her really unpredictably and in the best situations couple can have. nnPlease guys help me identify the problem, advice how to cope with it and according to your experiences, is it really SAD i have currently or should I look somewhere else for the answer? nnPlease don't ignore this post, I know it's long but I could've written like 5 times this size to express whatever I feel daily. nn"

I suffer from Severe Major Depression Disorder, Severe Anxiety, Severe Insomnia, and God knows  what else.  At this point in my life, I'm cripplingly desperate to break my social anxiety and make friends for once.  I NEED friends.  Some background on me...nnnI started writing this tonight during a CA (Cocaine Anonymous) meeting in Arizona, where I now live.  I came out here from Flint, Michigan on June 16th for a 30 day residential treatment program (Rehab), completely leaving my ""Comfort zone"" in just about every way possible.  I've decided to stay and, basically, start a new life.  I'm overwhelmed, depressed, anxious and feeling hopeless. I purposely cut EVERY. SINGLE. LAST. CONNECTION I had in Michigan except for my mother (Which was hardly any).  I completed the rehab program and transitioned to a sober living house 2 Mondays ago.  I have 7 roommates (all male).  I got a job (that I absolutely CAN NOT stand, having no choice at the moment but to do it in order to pay weekly rent is DRASTICALLY intensifying my thoughts of suicide) at a temp agency last Friday, with the help of my roommates.  I work with 4 of them doing labor, we carry heavy boxes up seemingly endless flights of stairs on random construction sites for 8+ hours a day in the sun and heat with little to no breaks.  The ONLY upside to this job is the fact that we get paid daily.nnI started heavily using drugs when I was 17 in an effort to numb my anxiety and worries, and to suppress the memory(s?) of my entire life.  I was too successful at doing this, to the point that I've erased my personality and who I WAS entirely.  My parents went through a TERRIBLE divorce that started when I was 13 and ended when I was 16.  They waged war against each other and used me and my 2 sisters as pawns.  My father is a messed up, disgusting piece of trash.  I've cut connections with him entirely.  My mother is but the lesser of 2 evils.  I've kept contact with her out of sheer necessity.  I truly hate her, but I no longer show it.  I was mentally, emotionally and physically abused by both of my parents my entire life.  I was heavily sheltered as well.  My mother is a pedophile and had sexual relations with my younger sister's first boyfriend, in middle school.   A 7th grader.  She completely forgot about me and my sisters and devoted her life and our money to this child for over 2 years.  We no longer existed to my mother, we were nothing but punching bags for her during this time.  This is the primary cause of my parent's divorce.  After this child was out of the picture, my mother's current boyfriend (for 3 years now) took his place.  He is everything and we are NOTHING to her, and he knows it as well.  He takes full advantage of this.  As a result of everything, I dropped out of highschool my junior year.  My biggest mistake to date.nnI've gone back and forth between owning apartments for short periods of time and moving back in with my mother and her boyfriend since I was 17.  My preferred drugs have been opiates (painkillers, preferably Heroin), benzos, meth, crack/coke, alcohol and weed.  I've almost always mixed them all at once, ""Speedballing,"" if you will.  It's a miracle that I'm still alive.nnWhat led me to rehab and where I am now was a chain of events that started roughly a week before my 20th birthday earlier this year.  I was arrested and received a DUI that week.  A couple weeks later, I was arrested for possession of marijuana.  A couple weeks after that I was evicted from my apartment and I lost my job at GM.  All of this managed to open my eyes and convinced me I needed to go to rehab.nnIt may not seem like it, but this is a very, VERY short overview of things.  I have omitted some extremely big and important details of my life for the sake of keeping this somewhat short.nnBack to the main reason for me writing this tonight.  I NEED to learn how to make and keep friends.  I crave this more than anything.  I've NEVER had a true or close friend.  I have horrible social anxiety.  I've always been an introvert, I've NEVER been able to hold a conversation no matter how hard I've tried.  I'm awkwardly silent whenever I find myself in social situations.  I've had many chances since I've came to Arizona to change this and I've utterly failed every time, and these failures have caused me to close up even more.  Whenever I have a chance, absolutely nothing comes to mind for me to talk about, everything just goes blank.  My self esteem and confidence are at rock bottom.nnThank you for taking the time to read this, I'm willing to take any and all advice offered to me, and I have no problem with making close and personal friends on here.  I just need people to talk to.  Thank you again."

I was really miserable and only left my dorm to go to class. I think I went to the cafeteria about 3 time in the whole semester. I attempted to hang out with acquaintances at first, but that didn't last long-we didn't have all that much in common. I cried myself to sleep most nights and hated myself for not being able to live a normal college life. At some point I decided to talk to a counselor on my campus. After talking through stuff for a while, she put me on Lexapro. It helped me to claw my way out of the hole I was in and I was able to relax and get some food from the cafe by myself and raise my hand in class. I had been taking the meds for about a month when I started smoking weed. I found that the weed provided a more instant sense of relief and I fell off with the medication back in May. nNow, I can fell the anxiety and self loathing creeping back. I live with my dad when I'm not on campus. He disapproved of the meds and disapproves of the weed a lot more. He doesn't completely understand anxiety and wants me to find some other way to push through it. I don't know what that other way is. I'm not gonna stop smoking weed because it's fun to do with friends and it makes me feel better. But I'm also thinking about going back on the Lexapro because it really did help over time. I don't want to go back to how things were. And having to take a pill everyday for the rest of my life is seeming like a small price to pay if the result is me living a life without closing myself off from all it has to offer. n"

8073,"omegaSQU4RED","post","Does this qualify as social anxiety or am I just a bit shy/something else?","Hi all, I'm a 25-year old male from the UK, and I was also diagnosed with Asperger's when I was 4. nnSomething I've noticed over the last year or so is that I am not at all shy when it comes to talking to people, and occasionally I can go out of my way to and meet and speak to people I've never met before (such as a speed-dating event) and once thrown together with random people I can actually speak to them quite well.nnHowever, the main problem I have is being very averse to putting my foot in the door and agreeing to take part in things that involve meeting new people, and I also have very few contacts outside of my school friends, my work colleagues and my friends from uni. It's not that I feel actively scared of meeting new people, but it might be more of a subconscious thing. As a result, I hardly ever go out unless it's for a purpose or within my comfort zone. I do start worrying about what might happen or what they might think of me. I would describe myself as an introvert who masquerades as an extrovert.nnDoes this quality as any sort of social anxiety or is it just another characteristic?nnTL;DR - I can talk to random people when thrown together in a confident way, but I am very averse to actually going out and meeting people I have never met before."
8083,"tiredinfinitely","post","Extremely anxious about exposure therapy","I posted about this last week when I found out my therapist wanted to do it, but now that it is the night before, I am extremely anxious. My therapist wants to meet me at a store for our session and have me go up to strangers and ask them things. I also am pretty anxious about driving and usually I have one of my parents drive me, but tomorrow I am being forced to drive myself so that just adds to it. I'm worried that I will get there completely red faced, sweaty, on the verge of tears, heart pounding, and I will be noticeably anxious and I will probably stutter and trip up on my words to a bunch of strangers for a whole hour. I'm worried about looking awkward while being there with my therapist, I'm worried about only being able to escape the situation by verbally telling my therapist that I need to leave which will make me feel awkward (curse this illness that makes me feel awkward for trying to get out of awkward situations). I'm worried that being that anxious will make me physically sick to my stomach. I'm just worried about everything and I know that it is supposed to help me get used to being in anxiety inducing situations, but it is still hours before my session and I already feel sick to my stomach. I don't know what to do."

8090,"Czamudio","post","It gets better.","Hi. I'm 18 and I've had social anxiety for almost my entire life. I had very low self esteem, I was always sad, and I even posted here like a year ago. I couldnt even order a pizza in the phone, and every social encounter was a nightmare for me. That was until I went to Canada. For some reason, speaking in English was easier than in Spanish for me, and I didn't feel anxiety when talking, at least not as much as before. I went to the therapist and I learned to love myself. Even if you feel like you're a piece of garbage, you're not. It's all in your head, and you can change. I felt like I would be dealing with anxiety my whole life, and while I still feel anxious some times, I know how to control it. Not everyone is a bad person. Not everything is out of your control. If you decide to change, you can do it. Stop blaming your disorder and do something for yourself. You're not gonna get better if you keep telling yourself that you can't. Learn to love yourself and love life, we're extremely lucky to be here. The fact that life is meaningless means that you can give it your own meaning. Learn to talk with other people, they won't judge you as much as you think. nThe important thing is to be happy about yourself. When I decided that I could make a change, my life instantly got better and the people around me too. I'm now going out with my highschool crush and she makes me very happy. I just got informed that I was one of the best 10 people on my university and can go on a exchange to Europe for free. If you learn to love yourself, everything around you becomes better. I have no longer fear to talking to strangers even if they judge me because I know who I am. I got to go rn and can't write any longer, but trust me, when you are happy to be who you are, life gets better. nI may be not the best writer, and English is not my mother language, but if I helped at least one person reading this, writhing this is worth it.

I'm 19 now and still suffer, although i'm better in some ways and worse in others. I've never been able to work up the courage to talk to a doctor, i'm worried i'll be shrugged off and told that it's just part of being a teenager etc. The idea of an actual diagnosis also scares me, because does this mean i'd have to tell my university/workplace? Would i be treated differently or would i get the help i've always needed? I'm not very open with my family either, and i feel as if they would be ashamed if they knew there was something actually wrong with me. nnBasically my question is would it be easier to carry on like this for the rest of my life and just deal with it in silence, or attempt to change it?"
8099,"Snedwardowden","post","Instagram","I deleted instagram because im on r/NoFap and kept relapsing to instagram. I told everyone i was deleting the app but nobody texted me or tried to contact me, so i just sorta gave up. The problem is now im supposed to be going to college and i feel super anxious about everything, and having no friends doesnt help. I hardly leave my house. Ive missed both my math and english classes on the first day but i dont know anyone in the class (since i didnt even go) so idk how to get the homework. nnThe two classes i did go to were psych. and Econ (online class). Im thinking about dropping the classes i missed and just taking them next semester because this whole situation is so stressful. I didnt even register until after i graduated HS. Apparently i also missed the counseling and orientation so i have no clue what is going on. My mom keeps calling me asking if im going to class but i already missed the first day, and it's off campus at a high school i never went to, so idk which room to meet. Every time she calls she makes it very clear that im a disappointment and that shes upset with me, which isnt helping my situation. I almost missed my psych class yesterday because i didnt know where it was, and i was about to go find out when she calls me telling me to drive over to the community college campus and a whole bunch of other shit and it got so overwhelming that i just started crying and feeling useless. She called me and i was about to decline. Im glad i didnt because she told me it was in the main assembly room of my old high school. I was late, but at least i was there the first day.nnShe wants me to go to the classes i missed but i cant bring myself to do it. On top of that, my dad keeps texting me shit like ""How was school!??!?!?!"" and it gave me a ton of anxiety cause i would have to tell him i wasnt able to figure anything out. "
8101,"trysil","post","Insecure about whether or not I have social anxiety","This is long and rambling. Just want to put this stuff down in writing, as I can’t talk about this to anybody in my life (for obvious reasons). For context, I’m a 23-year-old Asian guy.nnI guess the punchline is that I’m so insecure I constantly doubt what’s even wrong with me. For example, I think I have social anxiety (I identify with a lot of the symptoms) but I’m honestly not sure if it’s actual social anxiety or if it’s just nervousness, shyness or me just being a little bitch. I also believe that there’s something wrong with my moods, as during my lows I will occasionally need to cut myself to alleviate the pain, but maybe everybody feels those lows and I’m just worse at handling them? My lows are also triggered by small things (like being involuntarily excluded from group conversations, not being invited to things I think I should be invited to, etc.), as I have a belief that the small things people do/don’t do involuntarily and subconsciously are far more revealing of true feelings than the things people consciously motivate themselves to do (which are typically far more equal and less hurtful). And being so affected by such trivial shit must mean that I'm weak and overly sensitive and narcissistic. I guess the thing that hurts me the most is that I feel nobody really cares about me. As in, if I were in the hospital because of an accident, nobody would visit me. And if I needed some real emotional support, I’d have to call a suicide prevention hotline because nobody would be around to listen to me. Part of the reason I refuse to get my wisdom teeth pulled out is because I know how embarrassing it would be to have to call an Uber after my operation, or explain to the doctors that I would have to be alone during the recovery period, as I don’t have anybody around.nnThe issue is that I can pinpoint most of the reasons why I feel like I identify with social anxiety symptoms. For example, I don’t like walking down the sidewalk of a busy street because I feel like all eyes of passing cars are judging what I’m wearing, how I’m walking, and I’m insecure about the things I wear and about the way I walk. I don’t like grocery shopping because I feel like people judge me for my appearance and for what I’m buying, and so I resort commonly to buying things for delivery online. I wish someone would just tell me “hey, your clothes are fine” or “hey, you walk fine” and I could stop doubting every action I do. Social anxiety has been described to me as being a chemical thing (like depression) which means that, if I can point to root mental causes of these behaviors, I can’t have social anxiety right? I’m just an insecure weirdo?nnI refuse to actually go to a psychiatrist for a few (likely irrational) reasons: 1) I’m afraid I’ll get told that there’s nothing wrong with me, and that I just need to pull my shit together and put one foot in front of the other like everybody else, and 2) I know there’s patient-doctor confidentiality and all that jazz, but if anybody in my field even has an inkling there’s something seriously mentally wrong with me, I’ll get branded as corrupted goods. My profession is all I really have.nnAnd then there’s my impact on the people around me. I hate making people feel awkward or negative. I hate that sometimes, when I’m in one of my low periods, I can make people feel nervous or that they’re walking on eggshells around me. And I hate that I give off a vibe of not wanting to do things with people, or that I don’t care about their problems, when really I desperately just want to connect with them and be their friend. I don’t wish I could kill myself, as that would be too messy. I sometimes wish that I could vanish into nothing, that every trace of my existence could be swept into oblivion, and that my influence on the lives around me could disappear without a trace. That way, the negative aura I have and all the negative influence I've made over my lifetime could vanish.nnI’m most likely going to die alone, as I do not want anybody to have to deal with my shit. I’ll just drag down everyone close to me. I think I’m going to focus on my professional goals (they’re big and bold and amazing) and, once I reach them, I’ll spend my life trying to make others’ lives better (I want to focus on mental health research and awareness, anti-bullying efforts, and childhood education). And then, if there comes a point when I feel that I am taking more value away from the world than I am adding (for example, if I'm making people around me miserable, or if I'm on welfare and exist merely just to exist), I’ll kill myself quietly so that our limited socioeconomic resources can be used to help those who are more deserving.nnDon’t really know why I wrote this, just felt like I needed to write it down. This helps. Thanks for staying with me."
8104,"Madkatruss","post","I've been alone for an entire week and it's driving me insane","Hey guys, I'm a self destructive 18 year old with social anxiety. Luckily, my SA is relatively minor due to my medication. I am a freshman in college. The only interaction I have is texting my boyfriend and my mom, but that's not even genuine human interaction. I don't know how to talk to people here. When meeting someone I always feel like I'm super awkward so I just give up on trying to be friends with the person. It's been one week since I've had social interaction. Today I started feeling anxious about whether or not my parents were going to invade my privacy and cancel my debit card and find out about what happened at certain doctor's visits (they made me allow them to look at my records). I almost had a panic attack thinking about it. Idk this was just venting. I guess give me advice. I don't care."
8113,"posix_compliant","post","Is this my social anxiety or something else?","I know that I have social anxiety. I'm seeing a therapist and making some progress with being able to talk to people more easily in public and at work, and I'll be seeing a psychiatrist soon to be prescribed medication. nnMy other problem is that I cannot flirt with girls or express my interest in any way. It feels like I just don't have that instinct or drive that other guys have to pursue them. I even tried online with Tinder, and I get ghosted by all of my matches because I just can't be flirty and they get bored. I can't even imagine myself being on a date with a girl, despite how much I want companionship. Is this just an effect of my social anxiety or could it be something else?"
8117,"Bluepreztel","post","I was at the hair salon and another client came in and said hey to my stylist and asked him how he was, the stylist said 'i feel better now that you are here'' I felt i made him uncomfortable after hearing that","I do not know if it is my overthinking or what. I feel uneasy in hair salons. I had bad experiences with hair salons because id have stylists insult me and my hair, or give me backhanded compliments on my looks. There was a point where I did not even go to a hair salon for two years because of my fear of bad experiences at hair salons. I tried to trim my hair myself or had someone else i trusted do it. I no longer have that person i trust to cut my hair in my life so i had to suck it up and find a hair salon. I finally tried and booked an appointment and was nearly shaking on the phone booking it with. I met the stylist and he seemed nice and gave informative advice on my curly hair.nnSo i decided to book an appointment with him again recently. This time, things felt different this time. I felt like he was lowkey judging me when i came in telling him what i wanted (when he said first impressions matter, i remember his vibe when he saw me come in) and i saw he sort of gave me an up and down look but tried to control it'. Before going to him, i did my eyebrows and went to wash my hair. As i was washing my hair, i heard him say 'I wouldnt do my eyebrows i dont wanna have them look like ....."" i didnt hear the word he said after. Maybe it was a coincidence when he mentioned eyebrows. I started to shake a little again and my heart was racing before going into the chair.nnI told him i wanted my hair straight since i will be starting a new job and he talked about how it would be my first day on the day job and such and he said first impressions matter, we will straighten it. (i have curly hair). it was sort of triggering when he said that because i instantly remembered all the negative first impressions i made on people despite being friendly. Maybe im being too sensitive, but something about that line sent me back to bad memories. He said it again 'First impressions matter, you are very intelligent''. Though i wonder if he thought i looked bad he had to resort to intelligent for first impressions.nnI think i make my hair stylist uncomfortable too, when another client came in, he greeted them (Seems he knew the client well) and when the client asked how was he, he said to the client ''i feel better now that you are here''. Made me think he felt unhappy/uncomfortable with me. and when i gave him a tip and said bye, he look almost scared/uncomfortable and backed a way bit from me while thanking me and telling me take care . LOL. I probably caught him off guard.nnI do have a lot of anxiety going to hairdressers because they do judge you on how you look and i just cant relax around them. i do not think i will be going to him anymore even if he did make my hair look nice and understands my hair. Its not worth it if we don;t feel comfortable or if i will be triggered and feel ugly.nnDo you think im overreacting, how would you feel is a stylist said these things"
