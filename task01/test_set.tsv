1427406391896154114	We are going into the 3rd week of school with my Muffin (oldest), and they just keep sending these notices in ones and twosies, alerting us that another person tested positive for Covid. Today we started the week off with one…*deep sigh* https://t.co/M20pmSZXGX
1571820640629293058	@DrLoupis We're here and ive never once tested positive for covid.
1550738184815800320	@SandroDemaio I am disheartened. My Mum got Covid in hospital &amp; I see people out &amp; about without a mask on. When did we decide the vulnerable &amp; elderly don’t matter? We kept her safe for years, then an unmasked asshole goes into hospital to visit or work &amp; she gets it. Legal Manslaughter. 💔🙏🏻
1345904312283779073	I landed in the ER, but was fine after a bad fall. Yeah, after Dr gates gave me my injection and 2 week quarantine instructions I was on my way! #NoVaccineForMe #TheGreatReset #Memes #BillGatesBioTerrorist #COVID19 #FakeNews #Vaccine #SayNoToVaccine #AntiVaccine #NWO #Agenda2021 https://t.co/ZnZ0YYj3OP
1372681476345585669	@EcoSexuality @kenklippenstein Not one tweet about how the Biden administration is allowing covid positive illegals into the country,  along with refusing to test for.covid at the border. That tells me, you're a fraud and EVERYTHING you do is for political points.
1376969190641299458	2 weeks later: “here’s my GoFundMe to help me pay my medical bills because I’m in the hospital battling COVID”
1555693200878231552	Well, I got an announcement, been feeling like crap recently on these past 2 days, was curious to do the Covid house test and found out I got positive and the whole fam as well. I guess I'll see ya'll later when I get better, Jajunara for now.
1445522052316729354	@searchfeast @BeerHugh @edengillespie @samanthamaiden They didn’t have to, they brought it with them(1 protestor was in ICU the next day⬆️ read the comments )&amp;spread it to the members at the doors &amp;many other protestors.I hope each&amp; every protestor feels very unwell &amp; watches one person they love suffer with a short bout of covid
1415395303650377736	It is unfortunate that he received such outstanding care while in the hospital.   I mean, maybe if he had suffered more and for a longer period, he might have learned to take covid seriously. Oh wait.  I forgot who I was talking about.
1485037374618939398	I’m collecting items to donate to the doctors and nurses at UNMC Covid Care Unit in Omaha, NE. Anything that can’t be donated to the hospital will be donated to the YES House. I have an Amazon Wishlist if your interested in helping @pulte https://t.co/VJH0M1ebq1
1469807321320759304	At a certain point I think we'll all be exposed to covid. That's why it is important to get vaccinated so you will be protected and if you do get sick it will be milder and not leave you in the hospital. Going unvaccinated is taking a completely unnecessary gamble with health.
1392490497071980548	Sir,I have come for corona test at Raghopur,Supaul Hospital,but after coming here socialdistancing is not being followed,so if a person's report is positive then there is a fear of spreading While there is enough space in the hospital to keep distance.#terminatemangalpandey https://t.co/85uDJkI95t
1384511508105728007	I have just read that 2 nurses in a care home in Ireland,have tested positive for covid, despite haveing been fully jagged😯😬😱 ..IDK..
1580571826509402112	"@roofeo24 My husband tried to send someone sick home yesterday, today they are covid positive. Another person showed up today with ""a cold"" and had not tested. https://t.co/49x9tP4834"
1490590898702348288	I get it (VERY clearly) that people are done with mask mandates. I do not have control of making a decision about when that will end. What I do know is I just spent the weekend in the ICU caring for very sick people, most with COVID and more being admitted. This isn’t over.
1455986851156619264	Within my own inner circle I’ve had people die of Covid and die with Covid. I’ve had people feel zero symptoms and others hospitalized. I’ve also had numerous people suffer severe side effects from the vaccines with hospital bills piling up.
1459374921226747907	@R0b1999 Well, when I was hospitalized I was the only one NOT vaccinated, the others Vaccinated and some with Covid19 and others with myocarditis.
1382051692175319040	@SandraTanBN What about people who have one upped the vaccine and tested positive for covid and beat it? Common sense would tell me those people should be good to go too
1509857489625694217	i got tested positive for covid today 😔 baru je excited nak naik school 💔
1419180177356214274	@DrRanj My husband tested positive for COVID on so called freedom day, This virus still very much exists.  From the heady days of Spring 2020 where everyone was helping each other it’s a shame we have come to this 😢
1402416187728961540	something I recommend organizations avoid: saying “You don’t fail a Covid test, you get a result” and then immediately be unclear if you plan to pay artists for the full contract if they test positive.
1471285861278961669	Tested positive for Covid… mild symptoms and feeling decent except for the fact that I can hardly smell or taste. BUT, it gives me great comfort knowing I’m going through this with @Giannis_An34 - I was so close to getting my booster, too. Not soon enough 🙄
1437041634890424323	@EndonozMrs I don't recall seeing a doc the entire time I was in the hospital last year with Covid.I guess they can care for Covid patients remotely?I told them I was going home (I had ABYSSMAL treatment from this @BalladHealth hospital).They said the doctor had to release me.What doc?I left
1380349190837010436	I have covid, can’t see my bf and my bffs in the ER. I’m down BAD😩
1436068424887652394	@NateWantsToBtl Even though I'm upset, I understand. All of yours guy's and our safety come first. I hope everyone who tested positive recover quickly. You did your best to prevent this, but Covid had other plans. In no means did you disappoint us. Love you all, take care!
1411717468360478729	@freed0m2019 @WhitingLynn @Karenlovecheese You know thousands of doctors &amp; nurses were redeployed to ICU &amp; Covid wards to deal with the crisis don’t you? Medical staff with no previous ICU experience traumatised after holding the hands of dying patients day in, day out. I know several personally: you’re talking nonsense
1502720148800778243	@SmilingScream @GeraldDonalds17 @awong37 How do you function? You don’t need someone telling u how to function. If you are still worried, then u use precautions like u have been. If u aren’t worried, u don’t. I got Covid in the hospital when I was having a procedure done. The only time I wear a mask is if I have…
1451890484394221571	@VictoriaCoren Be sure to take a lateral flow test Victoria. I thought I only had a cold but tested positive for covid.
1483521347016077312	@Timcast Let me help u. 1. To not die. 2. To mitigate the symptoms if u do contract covid. 3. To not be hospitalized which results in over taxing the medical system taking away beds from other that may require them for other reasons. Is that enough, or…?
1417488019116933130	@paul__johnson @bbclaurak So factually he’s correct about the avg age of those who died where covid was recorded and in relation to hospitalisation rate. No issue. But my thought is this cannot be from spmeone who was in hospital because of the virus, he’s literally driven the fear it seems inconsistent
1431016184749645832	@terrygalanis @Crowers21 🤦🏽‍♀️ had Covid unvaxed Suffered viral shedding from vaxed colleagues.. never had a positive test. Visit 5 households a day with kids climbing all over me trying to feed me their crisps off the floor, numerous cups of tea ☕️ 😂 wake up! FFS!
1416037182255640578	@radtek2112 Just let them do their thing. I know a maga guy who called people “vaxtards” - he’s in the hospital with Covid. Vent- ecmo- 10-15% permanent lung damage- currently can’t get his infection under control and his lungs keep filling with fluid. Hard to feel a ton of sympathy
1541445922269405185	Saw everyone test positive for Covid at NFT NYC and decided to get tested to be safeCan anyone tell me if this is positive or negative? https://t.co/AXixqnVglg
1576895296860147712	@Crow101yt I still got Positive on my corona test
1372602640778067968	It’s always something! Now the girl who was gone do my hair tested positive for Covid 🥴😩 I gotta find somebody else again 🤨
1386729222807433217	Just found out my work has been telling people in very close contact with other people who are covid positive that they don't need to get tested. They are fine and they need to return to work... glad to know we are safe 🤦
1481673124898766850	@bilaunfiltered I know what you mean I lost contact with some but between being in hospital with heart surgery and the Covid it makes it tough I try to at least text a quick message and I hope people don’t think I forgot about them
1422417020738580482	@LoriTindel @KayTDid1 @GagoTheo @RealCandaceO I don’t need you to be.  We are all vaxed and of the 7 of us 4 have had COVID and on spent 4 days in the hospital.  You getting the shot or not creates virtually no risk on anyone else.  I guess science and freedom of choice are passé now.
1390665552000176133	@kirilovesyou_ Are you serious? Come on, be more careful. I have Covid and my breath was taken away by your stunning looks. I’ve been hospitalized.
1442846859790274570	@espn_macmahon @AlbertBreer I’m in favor of vax, but the vast, vast majority of people who get Covid, especially at your age, do not go to the hospital.
1382439822728384514	I went to one event and now I’m deathly ill. My vaccine is scheduled for Saturday and ☠️Of course! I get hella sick. I’m gonna be pissed if my covid test comes back positive.
1435802826991677441	@hkfinan Joe rogan beat covid in 2 days with ivermectin though....oh and oscar de la hoya is double vaxxed and covid put him in the hospital. 🤷‍♂️ but what do i know....
1451566805349134336	@NeilyWalker @Otto_English @JamesMelville A lot of late diagnosis and treatment was due to people being too scared to go to hospital because of the chance of catching COVID. I don't think there's anything you could do about that.
1379550834153943044	@drsanjaygupta  I had both Pfizer vaccine but after 2 and half weeks of the first I got this dry cough, I got tested for Covid using the fast result which showed negative and the normal test showed positive that was on the 3rd, the cough is gone and no other symptoms. Am I ok?
1478725970328944650	"@denimflame2222 OMG NOOO AHAHAHAHAHA I'm from the Philippines &amp; there was this girl named gwyneth chua that violated covid protocols. she was from us &amp; tested positive on covid, but still sneaked out from the quarantine area because she got ""connections"". - -"
1467884475191341061	@SoxChic7 @theysayitsrare @PhilsandJenn I personally know 5 ppl hospitalized long term or died from covid, plus an additional 10+ with serious long term complications. I know 0 people with vaccine injuries. Billions of shots given world wide, and covid by far has bigger percentage of side effects/ death than the vax
1410244341688307718	@Bitccolo @dumbgayretard I got the J&amp;J as a trial participant mid Dec 2020. My antibody test 5 weeks later was neg.I got Covid19 diagnosed Feb 6th. I had antibodies 3 weeks later. I have long hauler symptoms. I had Covid also in early 2020. Btw, I had a flu shot 1 month b4 the Covid vaccine. Thoughts?
1465438750348132361	@fergusonzxy1 @chelliesbee @NYCMayorsOffice @NYCMayor @NYCHealthCommr I am fully aware that Covid can still be spread even if you’re vaccinated but you’re less likely to be hospitalized or die from it. I am fully vaccinated and I still wear a mask everywhere I go!
1340128901201342464	i can not believe politicians just got the covid vaccine before frontline workers who are being exposed every single day living in fear of when they’re gonna be the ones lying in the hospital bed alone gasping for air
1351185614645948418	@danielkotzin @elms_JE what i cant understand is if so many have tested positive for covid why do they need a vaccine,,having covid should mean some immunity, or does it mean having the vaccine doesnt also make you immune.
1472973439858323461	@BretBaier @SpecialReport I’d really like to know exactly how sick the people are who are part of this huge spike in Covid. There’s been no distinction between delta and omicron in the numbers and which variant is putting people in the hospital.
1345178886741532673	So I lay here with Covid, I missed Xmas, I missed Nye I never went out without a mask idk what is going to happen to me. If I get sicker I head to the hospital by myself Still no vaccine available to me or anyone I could Die w3 vaccine available
1394660128834654213	All the COVID positive cases we’ve had at our facility were tested by me.. itlhele le sa tshoga yaana sometimes 😭
1480982959759020032	@DuncanBannatyne boris does not care about NHS or the people that have suffered and died .he is just out for himself .the day before his party I was rushed into hospital with covid so I no where i was https://t.co/sUEc2euJCM
1374485423238520832	Research into Long covid may yet help people like E who have a chronic illness that they have fought to get diagnosed.  I hope they get help more quickly than the journey we have been on.  However, the NHS is struggling from Covid related delays as well as lack of interest.
1474342278063964164	I need to go to the hospital bad but wit this Covid shit i fckin refuse
1414263233737789440	@HollieTheCard @BBCNews These ones, yes? But feel free to explain to my mum that these prevented her contracting covid in Hospital. When the only people that went near her, were staff who had full PPE. https://t.co/nlqigAg03W
1379295090083033092	@tammygolden @pattonoswalt I tested positive for Covid last week. When my taste and smell return to the stable, I will eat until my tongue snaps off its roller.
1472932061849825286	@fatdragonpro I tested over ten covid test kits and dabbed the swab in a new bottle of water instead of my nose and it tested positive on all of them. How is this possible? Bad test kits or tainted water or just faulty tests? Seriously confused here.
1394269150311223297	@pedi_hun @salimosaid @iGongPlatz These guys are not in charge of COVID testing. They are just fans. Trust me Simba already know who they are going to test positive for COVID. 😂
1464306549728370692	@chipfranklin I say f*ck off you stupid Texans.  Stay in your homes and leave the rest of us alone. Oh and do t go to the hospital when you end up with COVID.
1478053432409874432	@SwiftMoya @JDELBS76 @Breaking911 I had Covid. Not vaxxed. Barely any symptoms. This is the same for 99% of the people who got Covid in 2020 without the shot. What’s your excuse for vaccinated people who still go to the hospital or die from covid?
1392132188741595146	Sen Richard Burr:(Pph) ”…what the number of tested COVID positive ppl aside from the counted vaccinated population…are protected, we need that number, Not sure whose responsibility it is…cuz I’ve been spending all my time carrying trimp water 5 years, but we need that number.”
1573405396273864704	took a covid test cuz bff got covid and he sat next to me Uday praying that its positive butttt my shit fell down while i was doing ir so
1563684110023147520	"I knew it was BS the moment they publicised the criteria for a ""covid death"" - death from ANY CAUSE within 28 days of a positive test?!?!? That's not even necessarily dying WITH covid, and will certainly produce a hugely inflated figure compared with dying FROM covid.Damn liars."
1439615496840617988	@RaylanMantooth @SKMorefield I came down with Covid at the very onset of the pandemic in late December 2019. I've tested positive for the natural antibodies as recently as 2 months ago. Although I'm just a single data point, I'm living proof that the antibodies can remain for up to 1.5 years.
1476234076566794241	Have I seen more baby/engagement announcements this holiday season or positive Covid test results/Covid related cancellations? Who am I kidding? It’s the covid. But it was a close call there for a second.
1472668207244881920	they weren’t kidding when they said some people don’t show symptoms and still test positive this is my second time testing positive for covid and i haven’t had really any symptoms either time
1388761486223368203	Had both Jabs, tested 3 times in Hospital - All negative. Was in HDU for most of his stay, then transfered to ward, he was insistent on going home, they reluctantly allowed. Hospital now Covid free they said. He was telling me how marvelous they were until I broke the DNR news.
1350112917497278465	@WendyENThomas @Lymenews I’m so sorry to hear that. Hope she’s okay now!This happened to me 3 years ago when I got the flu shot. Ultimately, I ended up in the hospital feeling like I was actually dying, which is why I will not be getting the Covid19 vaccine. I have Chronic Neurological Lyme and Babesia
1382554543951515652	@Robin_Quon @ninaburleigh @nathanheller @pfizer @moderna_tx @AstraZeneca I now get where you got your numbers from. You’ve misunderstood.1. MRNA vax’s 95% against ANY diagnosed covid is much better than J&amp;J’s 70% against moderate Covid.2. The two deaths in the mRNA vaccinated people were non-covid. 3. J&amp;J had 3 non-covid deaths in vax group.
1430707034744295432	@southernsass81 What's strange was I spent 25 days in the hospital the last 5 were from covid they gave me.
1477074788917018626	@pulte https://t.co/bcXNMxloEy I pray and when I won’t give up I just lost my auntie yesterday due to Covid I’m in the hospital fighting a kidney infection I’m trying to pay my bills I have a lot of hard times on my hands
1380127642263896064	@ViburnumCatapus I do think the panic, when you actually look at the chances, compared to the risks of actually contracting Covid &amp; developing serious issues/ending up in ICU, or death, is extremely low. Important to remember, a common problem in Covid, ironically is blood clots!

1420924902002118660	@Lying_For_Jesus @ThaRealJgibbs I was hospitalized after getting the vaccine. After the first shot I was sicker than when I actually had COVID. After the second I was in the hospital for 5 days. But it’s safe they say.  It’s effective they say, but people who get it are still getting COVID. 🤷‍♂️
1470812598144745480	So many of my close contacts have tested positive over the past few days. Someone on Facebook is adamant this is just down to more testing. Well, maybe it’s because they’ve been unnecessarily exposed to COVID at work &amp; in public. Please wear a mask. It’s the minimum requirement.
1386269088629018625	Wrong year mate.

1461011057393258498	@gabaiel I thought they were made for that, yes, and also because being vaccinated isn't preventing anyone from getting/spreading Covid - seems like it's preventing people from getting severely ill in most cases, from being hospitalized in some cases, but even that is not a given.
1410411449483075588	In the midst of me working through these issues I had family members in the hospital with COVID, lost a family member, and have been hospitalized myself for unrelated matters in the last several weeks. the last of the orders are making their way out and I appreciate your patience
1475594891589791748	@ArcticFox_am_I @mamafluffs @RVAwonk @nina_hilary Gee, I don't like your doctor. I would have been tempted to call him out on that. He could have written that no test was available to confirm but that he diagnosed you with #Covid on the basis of history and exam. And he knows he could have done that, but instead he chose to lie.

I know two morbidly obese people in their 40s who I figured would likely die because they are horribly unhealthy.  Both were fine after two days in the hospital.  Uh oh, our anecdotes collide.  Have to go with impartial data
1538785415167356929	#VaccineInjured I collapsed twice in front of my kids with myopericarditis. First thing every doctor asked was whether I got the Covid jab. When I said yes, they nodded their head and knew exactly what it was. Spent 2 days in hospital and my heart is still recovering.
1425243424823779328	idk how you can see statistics like “99% of hospitalized covid patients are unvaccinated” and still be like ohhh yeah something extremely shady is going on behind the scenes shut the fuck up already jesus christ the second hand embarrassment i feel has literally never been higher
1617263740822646785	@CDCgov IT was five days ago that I tested positive with COVID19. AGAIN I tested the home kit last night and the result is below.FIVE days later and I can still feel it, but not as much now.  And NO...THIS is not just a fuckin flu, you @dumasses! https://t.co/wcxVDtxZyt

1378740719209316361	@alexperrin15 @JDuzza10 @oldbob1944 @BorisJohnson i’m not antivax at all, but if i didn’t get the vaccine, and contracted covid, i wouldn’t end up in hospital. the vulnerable, who’d otherwise be more likely to end up in hospital, are vaccinated. some people, with or without the vaccine, will end up in hospital that’s unavoidable
1514987110884913155	Still far too high  in the past 3 days I know 7 people who have tested positive for Covid, thankfully they are sensible &amp; are self isolating  despite the silence from @DHSCgovuk giving public health messages. Media boredom 😴 https://t.co/UbW9O1FT4C
1405157946112282625	What do I do?I would have had my covid vaccination tomorrow but my blood levels are really low.. so now what? Idk what to do in the hospital if the departments there are already closed and I certainly don't want to stay there. Plus I can't just go there thanks to covid situation
1387578397761495044	@heidibergstrom Agree however the other options you don't want to take trust me I had covid-19 was in the ICU for 9 days in the hospital 35 days so I'm talking from the horse's mouth not the horse's ass life experience with the Coronavirus. There are experimental drugs in the US.
1449784508262277122	@HoppySaul @LCWF_TBK @helencrofoot Also worth mentioning that staff are not notified either, we just see it when kids are marked with an X on the register.

1373915825636261899	@pinkandtweed @DarrenPlymouth Yes, we need to 'call out' those denying the pandemic. I have recently spent 29 days in hospital with severe COVID which impacted my Liver, Kidneys and other organs. I was in 8 wards all of which were totally full with COVID patients most of whom were clearly severely ill.

1437578109654482945	@mrdongsontoyou @MarcDClair Wait? I thought it was 1 million in Chicago’s ICU beds for Covid, and 2 million got shot and couldn’t get into the emergency room. Oh! And everyone that was shot was unvaccinated.
1382642568824037377	If PCR testing isn't complete garbage then how TF did I test positive then negative within 8 hours? Zero symptoms. Mandatory test. I already had covid and have IgG antibodies.
1418252040996892674	Last #DEFCON was in '18 before being diagnosed with cancer. Could not go in '19 due to chemo and surgery.  Even without COVID, I was not ready in '20. I'm not going this year due to COVID. I'm hopeful for '22.

1413196030447865858	@_megster @cooj2_0 In my early 60s I refused flu jab on the grounds I’ve never had flu in my life. Having since been hospitalised twice with pneumonia (once in ICU) &amp; still not fully recovered from that, I’m convinced long Covid is real (I now get flu &amp; pneumonia jab every year) I don’t want Covid.
1478156773953581056	Facts: I know someone that tested positive for COVID-19....that was not vaccinated. They rested for several days and administered the old remedies of old, and they are clear and cured.. it was as equivalent as the 24 hours flu....hmmm
1430286720885350406	@spottymalone @Raf_Epstein @TheDohertyInst I think opening up modelling is trying to find that fine line where you can open up the community and not overwhelm the hospital system so all people with/out covid needing hospitalisation have access to hospital staff and beds.

1611262883975024641	@MarieNMaxRback @RossKneeDeep I don't think so. Remember there were people who were hospitalized with covid but refused to believe they had it. Others who demanded unproven treatments like ivermectin, even suing the hospital with the judge order the doctor to comply. We are living in the dumbest timeline ever
1473341021698371592	@gnuseibeh I’m in Malta for Christmas - a sane CMO who recognises that the symptoms are currently not severe, and who also acknowledges people in hospital with Covid were not admitted for Covid reasons. A model to follow
1457352791907717133	@Lerianis1 @BlueSoBlue1 @CBSNews @AaronRodgers12 That’s not true. Care to provide evidence to support your comment? Which coronaviruses exactly? Long hauling symptoms is not something I’ve seen prior to Covid, other than in ME/CFS. We haven’t had a ton of children hospitalized here but, the ones we have are under 2 years of age
1375730397334605826	Not me ending up in hospital after having my covid vaccine lmao
1478729306918506497	@RepThomasMassie I suspect that has always been the case. The entire Federal response to covid has been predicated upon having enough positive test to scare people into allowing them to justify the tyranny
1513651420100190218	Remember that ignorant, foolish, dangerous, and irresponsible quote that scores of people sadly believed which only contributed to more people becoming infected, hospitalized and dying from COVID 19? Yes, unfortunately I do remember.
1387128031962189828	There was actually someone I know that thought Covid wasn't real until I told him I tested positive for it.
1488151051568041989	if your first thought after someone is diagnosed with covid and appendicitis is “damn good thing the silly award show that means nothing got rescheduled” and not “i hope they get better!” then maybe…reflect a little…
1479965705713991684	@northerness I actually don’t believe some infections are covid though. I think the test is not accurate making even a cold test positive in some instances.
1394051781685039108	@TinaG_SD @BioTurboNick that was how I read it too. The covid test coming up positive was unrelated to why they were hospitalized (if you're hit by a car, the fact that you're asymptomatic with covid is not the actual thing that is sending you to the hospital).
1476467035819364352	Handed over in work to a work colleague 3 hours later he took a Covid test and was positive... No cough, no symptoms whatsoever he feels as fit as a fiddle.  He can't understand how he has is nor can I 🤔
1421527713697861633	@nevermindscott @nneal1213 @4fatherCA @JenniferSey So, here in one of the biggest cities in the country (in the top 50). I know 100s that either had covid, shot or both. None died from either, one hospitalized for each and most slightly sick from both. You knowing 3 that passed is incredible odds. 4/4

1374299650145067009	@northyorkscc @NYorksPolice Was in hospital recently for 4 days and nights. As a lot of Covid is caught in hospital thought I’d be sensible and go for a test when I came out at a local drive through. As I had no symptoms however I wasn’t allowed one. Asked them sharif I was a symptomatic? Was still refused
1385372442512793601	A bunch of ppl I hung out with last weekend all tested positive for corona between Monday and yesterday. I was the only one in the bunch with my full vaccine dosage. I’m not a scientist but you should consider taking the vaccine if you haven’t done so as yet.

1416379591611011075	@MatthewNewell67 @BlackersNot Yes true, me too. But covid deaths have been massively inflated. See Lisbon, 17,000 deaths reported WITH covid but only actually 152 OF covid. If we are reporting all deaths 28 days after positive test as covid, shouldn't we do the same with the vaccine?
1405773345379950595	At least12 double jabbed people have died of covid in hospital add this to the hundreds (poss K's) killed BY the vaccine doesn't fill me with much confidence it works.. ⬇️
1442600748378992642	@USlawreview I know a RN who got the Covid, and her saturation level got down in the 70s, and she refused to go to the hospital because she knew they would put her on a vent and she didn’t want to be intubated. She’s alive.
1388226387149008902	My husband can’t taste anything and the covid test lady told him even though his test was negative it could be wrong because it hasn’t been long enough for the test to be positive so he’s quarantined in our bedroom while I take care of the kids😅I’m fine. Everything is fine.
1473605573006483457	Crap. My mate has just tested positive for COVID and I'm wondering whether I  can be bothered to make the long journey to the game tonight 🤔
1431294808904114180	@imgrund Let me help you: few indisputable facts:Countries with high vaccination rates - high number of Covid CasesCanada - 6 times lower Covid rates prior to vaccination Israel: 90% hospitalized vaccinated Lockdowns + high vaccination rates = disaster caused by anti science cult https://t.co/ndExEy9o6B
1559864192848596995	Finally, after 14 months, last week in Bangkok I got diagnosed long covid by dr. Pornratanarangsi. I am still suffering from short breath, high blood pressure, hairloss.. but happy I finally have recognition of what I have. In Bali the best cardiologist couldn’t tell me.
1480857010753187841	@GoJonnyBananas I wish it was! If he did have covid I certainly don’t think it was severe enough to be admitted to hospital. He’s a born liar.
1418688544206434310	@justin_hart I was actually thinking about this earlier. Are these people they're talking about in the hospital (vaxxed vs unvaxxed) in the hospital for Covid of for something else?! Manipulation of data for behavior modification effect.
1430617746522447876	@freedom_now6 @Philmachinist @NBCNews I am asking you if you know anyone that has suffered from the COVID vaccine. Why are you deflecting my question buddy? I thought you liked people telling it like it is. So you tell me like it is. Has anyone you have known gotten vaccinated, and are they dead/in the hospital?
1461027831035666437	Well it sucks but I have tested positive for Covid. Only minor symptoms like sometimes being tired and stuffy sinuses. Hopefully it stays that way. Get your shots and wear a mask.
1349159645823307777	So if I lived in DeKalb County and got tested in Aurora, my positive/negative COVID-19 case would NOT count for Aurora, but for DeKalb County. Make sense? (I've updated this article to clarify for our readers, &amp; we'll begin incorporating daily vaccine data into our coverage)
1478759694164365317	@Lewandisneyy i just tested positive for covid 19

1447366477238112256	@BNola1959 @DrKellyVictory @filipe_rafaeli Check Dr. Anthony Wong - he had no previous diseases, took HCQ &amp; IVM as soon as he got diagnosed with Covid - and died anyway. I can name several other exemples.
1382721344345804807	Two weeks since my second shot! I made it. I didn't catch Covid, I didn't end up in the hospital, and I didn't die. And even if I'm extremely unlucky and do catch it even when vaccinated, I won't end up in the hospital.What a huge fucking relief.
1471224771820105730	"@DineshDSouza Vaccinated people can contract and do spread Covid-19. Vaccinated people are also hospitalized and die from Covid-19. I fail to see why we still pretend it's a ""vaccine"" 😂"

1572659167542013952	just took another covid test and i guess it’s still positive even though it’s so fucking faint. i’m so over this shit
1442839934314815498	@MaksymichFamily @CTVCalgary I would rather have the justice system added to them more people in the hospital. People need to get over themselves and just get vaccinated. Or maybe the hospitals should just refuse unvaccinated COVID patients!
1455912158131261441	@Timcast I recently got covid. I was well prepared to treat myself. On day 1 of symptoms and positive self-test I started treating myself with higher doses of vitamines; zink; ivermectin and melatonin. I had a fever and headache on day 1; on day 4 I was completely back to normal

1477293635670528006	Well almost a year to the day that I got pinged by Serco Test and Trace I now have to isolate again for 7 days due to my OH having tested positive for Covid. Oh well I managed to self isolate on the bike for a couple of hours today
1378644163005145090	@Pavlovsdog86 @jlj952 @PoliticsForAlI @Telegraph Well unless you have a positive test you cant just assume you have had covid? i work in a lab with covid and i’ve never had it before? getting a vaccine doesn’t mean you’re scared of it lol just means you’re protecting yourself and others
1373950184439357441	1/2 My five years old girl tested positive for COVID because her teacher had COVID positive. How can we quarantine such a little girl. There are so many cases of COVID in Bahawalpur and Rahim Yar Khan but schools are still open.
1455170259195994112	@FooDGrohl hey Dave. Hope you're well! Long shot, but my wife is very sick and scared in hospital battling COVID. Is there any way you can record like a five-second vid to say hi and wish her well? It would mean the world to her...her name is Geri. Thank you so much...
1595616546550083585	Finally watching last night’s finale. I bet half the people on that stage wished they had a positive Covid test so they could have skipped that dumpster fire. #BachelorInParadise
1466481376690065413	Definitely got covid tested positive twice what the fuck am i meant to do now
1469428736231723020	These are the responses I always get, as if maintaining everyone else at COVID DEFCON 1 is going to change whether the unvaccinated end up in the hospital. I say: Good for Gov. @jaredpolis
1507955524943286277	I tested positive for COVID when I got home even after mostly sequestering myself for the last 2 days of GDC.If we met or hung out at any point, get tested, several times, over several days.My timeline below👇
1376540982657880066	@RaineYiVTube My job just had to shut down and I'm out of work for two weeks because someone in my workplace tested positive. I had COVID in December.
1485898248132902912	@GritsnG @DeAngelisCorey Tell me about it. Sadly,some of our last WW2 vets were lost to covid. I can only imagine their opinion of people who are outraged at the inconvenience of wearing a mask during a pandemic,as they were in the ICU barely able to breathe. It’s tragic.
1574138022827786240	If people are comparing being allowed to spread covid in public spaces to being allowed to have sex with HIV... does that mean they think it's ok to rape somebody to give them HIV? Because if I have to go to the hospital unconscious and the doctor breathes on me.. NON consensual.
1467206531536068608	I had to be taken to hospital last weekend. Would have been admitted, but no rooms available and short staffed at one of largest hospitals in central Ohio. Reason? Full up w/Covid patients, mostly unvaxed. As for staff? Just plain worn out from the pressure of the pandemic. And
1551677831255556096	@americangirljb @JesseKellyDC I have to disagree. My wife, after having COVID, still has a loss of smell after 1 year and 8 months. She also has a persistent inflammatory response that has been diagnosed as Lupus since her bout with COVID. There can are long term issues for some, and it's measurable.
1419265677135945728	@joanie4353 @Klb0415 @MrStevenCree I tend to believe the doctor working in Lariboisiere hospital in Paris that said two hours ago that all the COVID patients in the ICU today weren’t vaccinated… and it was the exact same speech than the one working in a Bordeaux hospital yesterday …

1478461822248398851	Have you tested positive for Covid in the last 2 years (I can’t believe it’s already been 2 years)? I have, back in September.
1346316228659347456	@donlemon My wife took the vaccine on 12/23/20 and was positive for #Covid on the 26th. I received the vaccine on the 12/28/20 and today I tested positive, we both work at the hospital so my question is taking the vaccine did it make us more vulnerable to catch #Covid?  @CNN
1508569200654110721	Update: a loved one is currently in the hospital with the flu. They likely will die. Ive had no loved ones hospitalized for covid. #justtheflu
1389560764533559297	nooo my covid test result is positive😩
1427751289375674370	I’m shocked, SHOCKED, that someone who steadfastly refuses to mask up and has been gladhanding at lots of GOP fundraiser events lately (a number of them indoors) in close contact with suburban and rural unvaccinated folks has tested positive for COVID.
1560751746246483969	@fahadfareed07 @Zaishe57 Vaccination is mostly a difference between icu on a ventilator vs a few days cold. There are still the odd patient not vaccinated but in my state with 70 percent plus compliance covid patients are now a rarity in the hospital
1425133893657796616	@duty2warn Every right wing host should have a “I got Covid and am in the hospital. Go get vaccinated!” playing on repeat during their time slot
1386416595107336196	I got my test results back I did in fact test positive for COVID, after I received my first vaccine dose.HOWEVER, I would like to state that I was entirely less sick than my partner who did not get any shots. I just felt like I had bad allergies while he def looked flu like 😂
1428795397288325122	@ShaliBug As someone who isn’t working in a hospital, I don’t really see that anymore. All I see is “hospitals are overwhelmed with Covid pts” So in the public’s eyes I feel like they think that means if you have Covid, go to the hospital.
1431709391883886601	@killerdude901 @FatFrostyy @ES_FTW @HitsPsych I was in the Hospital for a week for a potential overdose of gfuel that's even possible and allegedly it took me 70 days to get off at completely during the start of the covid pandemic...showing signs of having covid-19 without having covid-19. (Anxiety)
1462174051485503490	These numbers are scary. Back in Sept when the numbers were last this high, 22% of #covid19 cases were fully vaccinated and 9% of those in hospital were vaccinated. Now it’s 40% and 24%. That seems huge to me, a worrying trend and good reason to keep being careful.
1474802438171512832	@fatphillycat @TheOnlyRSJ @ATLUncensored I will say this had that been me on that plane she did that to it wouldn't be COVID that put her in the ICU.

In fact, my highest risk family members tested positive for antibodies. So, I know I've been exposed numerous times. This all comes to play when I weigh risk of covid vs risk of vaccine.
1454953781972643840	@TViewfromhere @globalnews So how likely is it that I'll end up hospitalized if I get COVID?

1490700206098235393	@CDN_Patriots What about the other side of this coin. As the media fixates on the pct of unvaxxed in the hospital for covid, I note they completely ignore how many are in hospitals for vaxx injuries and have no concern for the possibility that some are dying as a result of taking the vaxx.
1558152296021770246	I would rather have preventative covid drug, #Evusheld for the #immunosuppressed from UK @AstraZeneca used in 32 other countries and recommended by 120+ UK doctors than stay in hospital and risk antivirals which may or may not work. @evusheld4theuk @adamhillscomedy

1574164224162648064	@BilsonhBilson @OzraeliAvi Interesting. Not unlike cancer, Covid is no respected of persons or vaccines. You'll have to state where your numbers come from. It's about an even number of both vaxed and unvaxed getting Covid. I believe in 2021 the numbers shifted and more vaxed than unvaxed were hospitalized.
1383244376294313991	I have been careful all this time and thankfully not caught it. I have asthma and #covid would get me a 1st class tic to the hospital

1374749522384068611	Covid PSA #2 for the day: It is NOT helpful to tell someone with Covid stories about folks going into the hospital weeks later or things going south due to (insert symptom here). My anxiety is already through the roof. I get it. I’m paying attention.
1485683781470199809	@avuhlie My first rapid test came up negative when I felt like shit last month. Took a second one 2 days later and it immediately came up positive for Covid. Probably the same thing for you if you take another test later

1424843592368070658	Exactly. When I hear of kids going to the ER because of COVID symptoms it disgusts me that the adults did this to them.
1374095464480448512	@TimBrando @BillHemmer @marchmadness Reasonably certain that if I cross the border seeking asylum and test positive for Covid, I also cannot play in the NCAA tournament.

1483154856328056832	Also a) everyone has Covid so there’s no appointments, b) I dont want to pay $75 for them to give me more NSAIDs and then tell me to go to the ER if it gets worse, c) it only hurts when I move so I just wont move
1549043818720153601	So of course the first time I test positive with Covid, is on the hottest days of the year so far. Attempting to keep cool. https://t.co/f1227UWEMn

I’d hate to do that and put myself at risk from serious adverse consequences or death on purpose, only to end up just as bad off and in hospital if I got covid. Oh wait, had it in Jan and it was no big deal. #naturalimmunity.
1433864720256147463	This government. I feel so damned defeated today. I’ve been in the hospital dispensary this past week and 80% of the admission orders I’ve gone through are COVID patients. Almost all of which are unvaccinated. The rate that this has happened is so frightening.

1387114763700903939	"@matherion I assume the figure with ""fatalities per 1M capita"" shows the number of people who died and who had a positive Covid test - matching info on page 6 of the RIVM report. To get a more complete picture we should probably also take into account excess deaths."
1376684948611076096	Now when you get sick and go to the hospital they think you got covid 😒like dam bitch I’m tired of a dam stick getting stuck up my nose😩
1399439695680000000	@unspinthespin An old boy I worked with might be losing a foot due to clotting though, so that’s just lovely. He went this whole time working and never got Covid. Took the vaccine because of the peer pressure and wanting to travel to Costa Rica and he’s still in the hospital.
1330196186284830721	As a former research scientist I feel like I should note that since don jr has tested positive for Covid we can eliminate Cocaine being the vaccine
1526477821513805824	I know covid is over, the new variant isn't serious, blah, blah, blah, but besides long covid risks, there are other problems. I had a bad ear infection as did a colleague who now has vertigo and spent time in the hospital. Vertigo is no fun.https://t.co/iMfZI5S6NW
1448135491044274176	@FoxNews I was sent to the icu after giving birth to my twins and my husband was kicked out of the hospital. After I recovered and was discharged, I was not allowed to visit my own babies in the NICU all because of covid policy’s. Very sad time in my life.
1387043606544871428	@Mucker74054518 @brianbuck4 @mcm_home @LadyTangwystle @CrunchyDoughnu1 @GmThompson7 This man may infected and infectious. He may go on to develop symptoms the following day. I had symptomatic COVID. Only tested because husband did. Took 2 days after positive test before I felt unwell.
1478776379604971522	@Annakhait Glad to hear. I'm fighting similar cold symptoms for a week already, although I didn't have a fever. Nevertheless, the covid test showed positive. My guess is that I got a cold with all its symptoms and asymptomatic covid on top of that.Wishing you fast and easy recovery.
1474156731089539076	@Robynnsonn I tested positive for covid yesterday and I haven’t left my apartment. people that are leaving are being irresponsible &amp; selfish. also the fact that people are bragging that they tested positive for covid but they’re still going out?? like y’all know that shit spreads right?
1487187914337370113	@LemmeTriggerU @MarcussTopp @CooperC06053188 @RKtheMan @CNNPolitics Deplorable, if you had even a single functioning brain cell, you’d know that the vast majority of covid deaths are occulting in hospitals. And the majority of those hospitalized are Deplorables, I mean unvaxxed. The vaccine is working wonderfully not to overload the hospitals!
1387565036844036100	@RyanSAdams My positive COVID test!
1476260268158115849	Any thoughts @winniemanu I bet he really was in a car crash then caught Covid in hospital. It is just msn spouting the lies, right? Numpty.

1505922106785255426	My 11 year old tested positive with a feint line this morning. Doing all we can to stop it passing to my wife who has post Covid Chronic Fatigue Syndrome as her body would not be able to cope. @nadhimzahawi @TennantRuth THIS is why you should have measures in place in schools 1/3 https://t.co/9B13l2IEvW
1477297508862898178	@RSPCA_official I just tested positive with Corona 😷
1338963246854926337	@StatHunting Hard to triage but I’d probably put anyone who’s tested positive in last 3 months in the same group as under 65 and healthy. But maybe it’s not worth the effort. I would just say anyone young and healthy who’s had Covid recently should wait and let someone else get the vaccine.
1379155192877301760	@moodyredhead @CBoTheEggman @JDWilli444 @avakva1 @GeraldoRivera They're basing asymptomatic spread of covid-19 on positive PCR tests. People who have immunity can still test positive since they cranked the PCR cycles for covid-19 to that well above any influenza or other coronavirus varieties. In my state, the DHHS admitted to &gt;50 cycles.
1401397973133758475	ever since I tested positive for covid 19, food just ain’t been tasting the same. It’s been since December... smh.
1419135761115488258	@PaulMinor4real Great job as always. Thought about your account when I was in the hospital with covid. Inspired me to keep going
1386853594381516800	I had warned all, at start, hiding covid cases and deaths to allow coronavirus to become permanent, in fact, all people tested positive, that should be announced through loudspeaker in 1km radius of their dwellings! no beds vvip ashoka hotel
1404887063275753472	Povetkin-Whyte II was rescheduled two months after its original date and Povetkin still looked awful after his Covid battle. I don’t buy this Teo-Kamboosas rescheduled just ONE month after his positive test. Somethings 🐠.
1382319001540366342	Can the vaccine trigger a false-positive COVID test? What if I miss my second vaccine dose? https://t.co/rxyXaar0S2
1367410005016776708	@dyslexicNews @RobertW48787695 I don't think it's the size of the needle. I think it's just the fact that  it was rushed out without proper trials and no one knows the long term after effects. Those who do succumb to the vaccine will never be named they will all be diagnosed as death by Covid.
1382910607461122050	Morons: Covid is a hoax. We want freedom. I won't wear a mask. Why should I listen to the scientists or doctors?Same morons after getting hospitalized due to covid: I need doctors to treat me. Give me medicines. Save my life.
1426538979688595461	@HotVannaNights I can’t actually believe that you guys are talking about an actor on a soap opera who tested positive for Covid.You don’t know if he’s vaccinated or anything else.He’s not the first to test positive for Covid on GH &amp; won’t be the last.Get well soon Steve!
1340394991009624065	So you will ignore the advice of your OWN doctor by refusing the Covid vaccine, but if you were in pain in the ER and a doctor who has never met you ordered IV narcotics, would you do the same research? Not shaming those in valid pain, I empathize. But where’s the logic?
1379481379331842057	Time to test all those apples, oranges and bananas for Covid. I'm sure one of them will test positive. Maybe the ice cream, too 🤪Will the ice cream have to self isolate? 😂
1479000719210409984	@dheekshaMD Punjab finance minister came to greet him. CM didn't bcoz his secy tested covid positive. PMO's plan a day before was thru helicopter. Yet, he altered route im the 11th hour. Also, there's only one route from bathinda to reach fzr. Hope this helps. https://t.co/cp8b4iNJcu
1404069751832387587	@FilthyCasual21 @Marx_ist @scotgov Exactly pal so many people worried about what might be… the cases are still relatively low compared to the population as a whole… the hospital numbers I mean 132??? Come on more people will be in hospital with broken bones than covid!! And for this silly rise we are delayed
1427200437522927619	@lorrain00414525 My bro in law ( 41 ) is unvaccinated &amp; tested positive for covid. He Stocked up on flush niacin, Vit D, Vit C, zinc, Vit B complex. 3 days in his temperature is down and starting to feel better this morning. No BBC style regrets &amp;  happy he didn’t get jabbed
1411181149175664640	Another heartbreaking plea in a public forum. “My husband has just been hospitalized with pneumonia in both lungs. Suspected Covid. My toddler had just swabbed for Covid, results will be ready in 5 days (of course!) but her fever already broke (thank God!).”
1526284226282328067	I want to CRY. The person I was supposed to see tested positive for COVID and now I can’t see them because I don’t want Covid again.
1433468570902618115	"I have been tested positive for Covid-19 after my both vaccines. Which only proves that they don't give you a ""golden ticket"". You still need to keep yourself and others safe. It's not over yet. Take care of yourself 💐"
1430318732145045504	@DrSamGirgis What about the fact I still have Covid antibodies from having Covid in November 2020?  Just had a Covid antibody blood test this past Friday and I'm positive for antibodies.
1476649427695775744	I don’t have to worry about this but I don’t see it going over well with employers! Do you know how short they’re going to be with all these people having to isolate for 10 days with no proof of positive test 😳🤯 and likely no sick pay either #onpoli #CovidTesting #covid19
1432376070267969536	"I'd like the @bcndp to notify the public as to how many of the ""70.6% of unvaccinated people"" w/COVID currently in hospital have:1) ONE or more comorbidities.2) Are obese or grossly overweight. If the Gov't of BC cared about the health of the people, this would be news."
1438844043140665350	//Good morning everyone, I wish this tweet was a lewd tweet but unfortunately I was close contact with someone that tested positive for COVID, while I don’t see any side effects i do wish that nothing bad happened’s and that I’ll be able to continue being active
1382383421389885443	So the antivaxxer nurse (literally no showed her scheduled vaccine because all the place had left was Pfizer) from my class who caught covid over a week ago has been in the hospital and I am so sad about it. I feel so sad for her family at this time. Please get vaccinated. 🙏
1393533007617826818	@Kunarian @tomhfh I wasn't posting the article for the misleading headline regarding the experts opinion.It was to show you where I got the 6 vaccinated people in hospital with Indian covid in Glasgow from.Anyone with half a brain can see where this is heading.
1330415765162364928	@RandPaul When Sars was first reported No one cared! It's been manifested and yes of course lots of people are testing positive Don't we all have some kind of covid strain in us? cold/flu.. I wonder how reliable are these test!? Will we even have a choice if we want to get this vaccine!?
1346290661931294723	“.. means about 82% of the state population will probably get the #COVID19 vaccine before you”..  guess on the positive note, the #vaccine will be throughly tested before I get it #lol
1385041307203219458	@jthemm @XavierLamarWar2 @TheJoshRush @FluffyToast10 @CaptainCryptoHD @Gobucks2112 @ac1ds0ul @KingJames Repeat this in you head for a second. If your diagnosed with covid, and I shoot you, and your death is labeled a homicide, did the doctor ever lie? Just because he had covid, and I shouldn't have to say this, means it impacted his chances of being strangled to death
1377634285839122436	I would sooner get covid and spend a month hospitalized with a tube down my throat than go back to 40 hour office weeks. I wouldn't have to kill 8 hours a day pretending to do boring thing to look like I'm not doing nothing instead, and it'd only last for a month worst case.

1514323982530478082	@Chill_Goblin This same exact thing happened to me and my wife. Got sick, slept in the same bed as her for a couple nights without thinking I had COVID then tested positive. She was asymptomatic the entire time. Get better soon bud.

1530766105035382784	@logogolologo @888Velvet You really should not assume things like this, it reflects poorly of your character.  I actually got Covid before the vaccine was being distributed in my state and then only doctors/nurses and people over 60 were allowed to take it but by then I was already in the hospital.
1523999162936791040	I have to say god has wrapped his wings around me battling Covid 🥺 I just had to bust out in prayer to thank him…I could be in the hospital on life support  but this port in my chest and weak immune system I can’t even get my infusions but he didn’t let it get to that !!

But Omicron is all over, and the Covid alert app has let me know I've been near some folks that tested positive. I barely leave the house and most of my interactions are curbside pickup
1425131200558026756	@JuliaDierbeck @crumbly_ustache @MKrinkle123 @LeanMeanClean75 @Summerfest @amfam It’s amazing that you all act like this is the first vaccine in history and that we haven’t eradicated many deadly viruses before this. I can’t help if you don’t believe in science. Just please don’t go to the ER if you need medical attention for COVID. Good luck to you morons.
1478337904913100805	Constantly worrying about my health on a daily added with my neurodiversity doesn't help. Two years ago I had life-saving emergency surgery. Stuck in the hospital for three weeks, the majority of the time alone due to covid restrictions, definitely the last place I want to be.
1374371377453486085	@npfoodie @tommy831 @nypost Yeah probably lower. Then the death rate... Man it's crazy. I'll give you the benefit. Say 10% get covid. Of those 10 less then 2% under 40 end up in hospital and less then .14% may die. Pretty low in the grand scheme of things. Wonder how many die from heart problems.....
1428046705186979840	I’m so glad I’m finally getting back to my normal self. Covid really tried to take me out g. I don’t think I ever been that sick in my entire life. The shit got to my lungs.. 8 days in the hospital dependent on oxygen. My recovery has been brutal but I’m finally getting there 🙏🏼
1431501904354295813	@SharnelleVella You're doing a great job. I rely on you for the facts now. No pressure!I'm fully vaxed so believe it's real but can you please tell us how many of the 150 kids in Vic under 10 with covid are in hospital. Feels like a  scare tactic
1375810362679955456	My so called roommate tells me they were tested for covid because they were around someone who was positive. Are you effing kidding me? I have health issues and have been very cautious. Waiting for my second vaccine. Why are people so stupid?
1478013608105807874	tested positive for covid on friday and it hasn't been much fun over the weekend, didn't expect to feel so rough. glad i've had the 3 jabs or it probably would of been worse.
1381910950136184832	@Milesy021 @MsBlackadder @Luisa47132714 @GosainRajesh You never asked if I was going to get the vaccine and I never told you if I'd tested positive for covid. You just assumed it. Which makes me question your ability to judge other information you read.
1470413066059853829	@All_White_Al @Yorkie6013 @bradratcliffe I've read the articles but it's pure scaremongering. I doubt there has been 75k deaths 'caused' by Covid in the UK. That means died as a result / due to Covid, not died 'with' covid. None of this with a 'positive test within 28 days' nonsense recorded as a covid death.
1355547491089973250	@UHDBTrust is there any guidance I could read please? I am barely functioning due to a significant #IBD flare up, but I am at risk of catching COVID if I come into hospital to receive treatment. I need the vaccine in order to do that. But am being denied it.
1474036909127127043	@Hunter2268 @JVR926 I only know one person that got COVID after Vax'd. I knew and had to telework with COVID people, even in the hospital before the vax came out. It is your body and I respect your choice. Stay safe.
1483429623753068547	@Factsination_ Theres an RSV virus that went through thousands of kids alot hospitalized . Masks and distancing dudnt work on this rsv and would nit work on actual covid. I been screaming this now schools here are giving n95 masks🙄the agenda continues🙄🤯
1379539562293252098	the bike shop was closing just as i got there bc someone tested positive for covid... so i had to hoof it up to the OTHER bike shop but they gave me a faster estimate and a cheaper quote so it worked out

1387871776424689665	@Cate_M_May @_Brad_Schmidt @lizzzyacker I'd assume they were hospitalized for another issue and tested for COVID as part of their hospital stay since that's pretty routine test these days at hospitals?
1459100403111501831	@annmcnam I had varicella as a kid and it was very mild! However I know people who were older when they got it and ended up in hospital! You are right we are obsessing over Covid when way safer and more needed vaccines are overlooked!
1571823557004660743	@timesofindia After I took booster dosage, I got covid tested positive➕
1550062610967498752	In the past year 6 people on my block (that I know of) got COVID - of those, 3 had to be hospitalized and one of them died. The most recent one is under 50 years old (probably not even 40yrs) &amp; her lung collapsed. 😷
1464462214782402560	@Bobcat8403 You are correct. My entire family is unvaccinated and tested positive for COVID on Wednesday! We basically had aggravating cold symptoms but 2 days later, we are just fine! Guess natural immunity actually does work! 🤦‍♀️
1378053751097937920	@Begsircao_SH Im surprised with how well sports leagues have handled Covid testing. The NBA usually only has a one or two people test positive whenever it does mass tests. #srm3224 #group1
1505416271579402240	@lapublichealth Zero COVID patients in the ICU that I work in. Would be nice to have a breakdown of hospitalizations from COVID.

1386402386353147907	I had my 2nd dose of Pfizer as I was unknowingly living with and sleeping next to a Covid positive person. Got tested yesterday and was negative. The vaccine WORKS. (I also only got a bit tired after the 2nd dose).

1478432655792246784	Cause I had to go to the ER the other day and the day after I had about an hour of the same kind of fever I got from my Covid vaccines and pain in the arm I got them in.
1602349972413976584	@irishdub1 @Ms_Muse_ I’m astonished that someone who ended up in ICU with Covid won’t have a flu jab. What’s the difference between that and being vaccinated against Covid?
1548665179227004929	@trishgreenhalgh Did I read that upwards of 20% of COVID infections are acquired in the hospital already? Loosening those restrictions exactly where the most vulnerable are seems a recipe for disaster.
1458156222889201664	@Scrlt39 @JPA313 @BuckSexton That is absolutely not true.  You must be a young person to spew that. Older people really do need to get the vaccine, but they also need to discuss it with their PCP. I was vaccinated and I didn't end up in the hospital. I caught Covid variant and did not end up in the hospital.
1374350019332075523	not just thinking about those who've died of covid today, but also a man I worked with who was unable to get a bed in hospital and died as a result. a story I imagine that resonates with a lot of people in this country. what a shit year it's been
1475938977639288841	Despite being fully-vaccinated (w/booster + flu shot) I just tested positive for COVID-19  with mild cold-like symptoms • My family and I will self-isolate • Stay safe, mask-up 😷 and get vaccinated 💪🏼💉#StrongerThanCovid https://t.co/y9ybjxQYmm

1434640852597477381	@rush1_scott @Holbornlolz @Sam52420146 10% of the under 50s and 61% of the over 50s.521 of the under 50s + 2,668 of the over 50s = 3,189 people out of 9,472. That's 33 %. Include single jabs and it's 45%A near 50/50 chance of having covid in hospital, jabbed or not sounds like a different story to me.
1433809199419494408	Tell me vaxxers if covid vaccines are free doesn’t that seem a little suspicious to you? Because hospital bills aren’t free, but they wanna save lives? Then why are we losing people in the hospital. Covid vaccines are a sham.
1392044153144582146	@Vicster82 @UNISONinSchools And one for @ShamezLadhani I would be very happy for you to review a case in Sandwell hospital that was deemed as long covid with gastrointestinal issues now 5 months post Covid positive(was the only symptom when 11 year tested positive after school TX)
1384478459871875073	93 wouldn’t be that bad but I’m 5’5 !  I am on IV sometimes 24//7 the last year and a half ,and have had many surgeries,including stomach and lung ! Been a a respirator and chest tubes in the ICU and boy do they hurt 😢,I pray for all those suffering like that with Covid !
1447322108728692766	@RattlinRanch @RatbeachFran @_A_l_i_s_s_a_ @JoeBiden Most hospitalizations are those who are UNVACCINATED. Very little percentage of people who have the vaccine have been hospitalized, but with minor symptoms. Most people I know that have gotten covid and have not gotten the vaccine have died.
1374342118634819590	More Overclock today after the gig got canceled because of a positive covid test (I'm totally safe no concern there). That means more Mecha anime on tv while I jam out to Dua Lipa, Synthwave, House and Punk music.
1368820455839326209	I am not anti-vaxx but what confuses me is why if someone dies within 30 days of the vaccine it automatically has zero to do with the vaccine, but if someone dies for whatever reason within 30 days of a positive COVID test it is automatically blamed on COVID ? In the UK at least.
1527176767773241344	@Killa0403 I don't care.There's nearly 1/4 million people who'll be diagnosed with Covid this week, the AEC have failed spectacularly in any basic planning for a 2.5 year old pandemic.It's not just about you, ppl everywhere will be effected.250,000+ votes.
1429506018359271430	When I went to the hospital last year and when they said I had to be there by myself coz of covid I was terrified. I was lucky though most of the nurses and doctors were very kind
1416761359837061124	"#Marr today was supposed to be joined by Sajid Javid. I know he has tested positive for #coronavirus but surely his own description of ""mild symptoms"" means he could have joined by zoom? (Other platforms are available)"
1383202826386599936	@caitybreacts Thank You for entertaining me today with your live! My week sucked (tested positive for covid 😩) but I had fun during your live 😂😂💜Ps: I’m glad you enjoyed the Mots:7 Albums! This is the Album that made me Army so I hope you’ll love it when you get to it!💜💙
1431724298067185681	Bro OTC what ppl be saying they going through w covid in the ICU i was going through in my bed I couldn’t walk to the bathroom without gasping for air pretty sure I was battling death not even bullshittin
1338130099573583872	@Zaddy_Bruh Read on an article that in Australia one bottle of covid 19 vaccine tested positive for Hiv so they halted the operation.. I haven't really researched the truth behind that article
1470660331634675723	Oh no... Xiaoting and mashiro tested positive for corona.. I hope they get well soon
1420365694697451525	@piersmorgan And what about those who end up in ICU or die due to the vaccine? You are an absolute disgrace to human society with your mind set! I had covid and choose not to have the vaccine! I am a taxpayer, I take care of myself, I am not an anti-vaxer I am an open minded person
1583801136100020224	@WALangProf @mildanalyst How many of these hospitalized patients are for REINFECTION? and how many are the ones who got covid for the first time? If the latter is the case, then cellular immunity is playing its part. Does anyone have this data to inform me?
1457911937933664257	@7THRINGFORPATS @kirstiealley Same exact with me. 5 mtgs after 2nd shot, severe Covid short of hospitalized….everyone tells me the vaccine saved my life.  🤷‍♀️ booster after 90 days? I’m skeptical now
1451322784756404227	Just learned my musical doppelgänger, @serjtankian, has tested positive for COVID Wishing to speediest of recoveries to you, good sir
1428751151747452935	@scanman614 It’s a triage decision Marc. You and I roll up to the ICU and all things are equal, we need the same immediate critical care except I’m vaccinated and you are not. The Vaccinated when sick with covid have a better prognosis for survival than unvaccinated so move aside big guy.
1423002797277028356	@GideonCRozner Can someone please compare all these Covid cases, hospitalized, ICU and death with normal flu before Covid even started? I’m interested to find out the comparison. Are we all just overly panicked over a flu?

1553453201151737857	Biden tested positive for covid again. What's it gonna take to make America wake up. Stop getting Vax and tested. Everyone I know who hasn't got the Vax hasn't gotten sick.
1387432753205972996	I haven't seen any doctors saying that people who already had covid and then were reinfected again are coming into the hospital. And yet, people with natural immunity are being told our immunity isn't good enough.
1373213086572802049	Imran Khan was obviously going to test positive for COVID19. He had the vaccine yesterday! The vaccine is practically COVID, however the symptoms are not as severe.Or am I being an idiot?
1415144841671974912	@thatreviewplace @MyFirstNameIsM1 @maggie_bomber @LesStock @ellymelly @catherine___c @SamanthaX_real I am getting my second jab tomorrow because on balance,  reducing the risk of a trip to ICU from COVID19 is worth the very small risk of side effects from a vaccination.
1440593591865208838	2/ I fell ill with a mild presentation Covid Jan 15-Feb 3. In February and March,immune system leukemia boomed in my body. I was diagnosed in April. The entire thing - Covid followed by Leukemia - feels like one giant episode to me. But, it could be two uncorrelated things.
1527060724182401026	Ugggg... Tested positive for covid today and feel like trash. Thankfully I'm vaccinated and boosted. Still zero flags of fun. https://t.co/A5cTczJaOy
1388384430268506113	Shortness of breath was the biggest one. Fever, lethargic, coughing, I felt like shit. Went to the ER twice &amp; was told I had “pneumonia” the first time the next time was told it was Covid &amp; to go home &amp; I’d be fine (This was early March of 2020) Which I was.
1400599730330079233	@MCRI_for_kids @TheDohertyInst @melanie_neeland @abcnews It's not just a matter of protecting children from severe (i.e. need to be in hospital, possibly on a respirator) Covid19.They need to be protected from Covid19 because of long Covid and also what we don't yet know about Covid19.We won't be able to turn the clock backwards.
1416769426712576004	Started my shift at 6am I have already diagnosed 2 Test Positive Covid Delta Variant 1) has a chance 2) will most likely not survive. Non - vaccinated as well
1479966953796104192	@MsahWu I had terrible abdominal pain and back pain, no cold symptoms and tested covid positive. You are doing the right thing by isolating.
1531217055143211008	@IainMulady @mrsks91 @TaniaLe84494434 @GlenGirl2 @hansel21_ @WATCHMEBURNDOW1 I bet Ian also believed everyone who gets covid goes to ICU and is intubated. Don’t waste your time or life with gutless cowards like Ian. He isn’t worth your precious time, he is incredibly miserable in life and projects.
1441112887355863052	@DwightMarshal19 I'm so sorry for your loss. 💔 We know unvaccinated people around us that now have Covid and in the hospital. It breaks my heart.
1448736028127281154	@cmall @stevendelrizzo @CityNewsYEG Or it could be a false positive which is incredibly common with PCR which has been cited by the CDC, and many other governing bodies as not being able to distinguish between covid and the flu. I would put my money on the propaganda piece that they fudged the test.
1480943499982045184	Our little dude (6YO) just tested positive for Covid. He’s fully vaxxed. We wear masks everywhere we go, but he got it at school. Thanks to the “But mah Freedoms” crowd for fucking up my world. I guess it’s just a matter of time before Stephen and I get it now.
1504510624692322305	@CCfunkandsoul @BBC6Music Happy St Patrick's day to yourself too Craig ( still going to have that one Guinness even though I tested positive for covid yesterday that won't stop me having this. If covid tries to stop me drinking this I'll rip its nipples off.

1402229325559119876	@mdnij34 I stayed alive and by the grace of my ancestors, while working in the Emergency Room, did not contract COVID. Weight was hardly an issue that concerned me or should concern anyone, staying alive and healthy was/is the goal😒
1381056449883873280	And we had a scare while gone. My husband had a severe allergic reaction (welts all over, lip swelling, &amp; throat feeling full) to (possibly) his 2nd covid shot &amp; we spent 4 hrs in the ER on our 1st day there. Thankfully he recovered fast on meds &amp; will have an EpiPen now...

1424417296190148609	@Svinhuvud @Trobby210 @BRXBIS @nytimes Take a look at the % of hospitalized covid patients in Israel who were vaxxed. I dare you :-).The solution is more vaccinations, up to as many as seven. If we're lucky, maybe more. For those who like shooting up, that is.
1422650489691426818	How in the hell does the Marion County Contract Tracers know I have COVID when I tested positive four states away?
1577906135713153025	@keetmuise Wow! Thanks for that memo! I will make sure to run back to the hospital that ignored my warnings, the doctors that mocked me &amp; a healthcare system that abandoned HCWs need for PPE!

1339529872662810627	Didn't @realDonaldTrump rave about the experimental life saving covid cocktail he was administered when hospitalized. It wasn't available to everyone. Why hasn't he taken the vaccine?Since when does he put anyone before himself? I don't trust it. Do you?https://t.co/n9ZjTPfmiz
1372675417832886277	"@rhodenjax m'luv. Last night I learned that a business owner who ""doesn't believe in COVID"" tested positive using private testing so the MOH won't have a record, told his staff not to tell anyone he was +, made them come to work all last week. 2 now tested positive &amp; still going to work.🙃"
1466836038643499009	I wonder if a lot of the unvaccinated would rather test positive for Covid than take the vaccine. If so, the vaccine passport only encourages people to catch Covid so than they can get the proof of recovery cert.
1422404652272955416	@Eliza_Eishen I think with you traveling and so many people not getting the shot it makes sense. It’s not going to prevent you from getting covid but it prevents you from being hospitalized if your happen to get it. I know so many young people right now who have it. Covid is not joke.
1412033392925892609	@audreymak2 I passed my RRT Boards in 1976. If you’re still working surely you’ve managed Covid patients on vents. Help me understand how you can support Trump who failed miserably in providing PPE to hospital workers. Said it would magically disappear. Suggested ingesting bleach

On lethal amounts of drugs.
1477059564214185984	@carloshconde Well, EVERY medicine has a side effect—so, I guess hospitals shouldn’t give them any in case they get hospitalized due to COVID 🤷🏻‍♂️

1515415495754850304	Great thread about small space in-home isolation.The only caveat I would make is that a + rapid test should always be considered a definitive positive.With their specificity to COVID, they give virtually no false + results, % the sensitivity means almost certainly contagious.
1481024907311992836	@GuyStorz @WokeLawyer @JamesSurowiecki And the unhealthy children who are getting hospitalized by covid....screw em?And covid has killed thousands of healthy and young people, I'm not sure how many need to die for you to care.  Do old people not matter?  Should they learn to reverse their age?
1510765916618993675	@RWranglebury No fever. Didn’t even think it could be Covid until family member tested positive. Started HCQ and prednisone with supplements on day4. Felt normal (minus slight cough) 4 days later.  Literally I’ve had worse colds.
1378151625873850369	@Sklen26 @aubrey_huff You don’t believe in conspiracies but you think hospitals around the country are changing test results that say positive for flu to positive for Covid. Oh and they’re doing it so collect more money. Did I get that right?
1366043037516898308	Most everyone I have met with a positive Covid test had Cold symptoms with a side of loss of taste. I’ll take that over a vaccine that could possibly cause irreversible damage any day! #mybodymychoice https://t.co/2MRQw4QWLD

1339032231176769536	@SkyNews I’m guessing you haven’t been listening to the science behind the vaccine, it doesn’t stop you getting Covid-19 so you will test positive if you get it, the vaccine stops a high percentage of the symptoms

1612484459449679875	See but not hospitalized =\= mild. Bc I had 8 months of long covid after getting it in Dec 2021 &amp; the initial infection did not feel mild to me at all. I wasn’t hospitalized but I almost went bc I genuinely felt like I was dying. Just bc u weren’t intubated shouldn’t mean “mild”.
1386716004277907460	The day I got notice of a covid vax appt available I was also diagnosed with a medical issue that keeps me from using it! Hoping it’s temporary. Please, get vaccinated and wear a mask, help those of us who CAN’T get the vax for some reason! You can save a life.

1387119129677664259	@Liz_Wheeler And what is considered as 'young'? I had a 17yr old on my unit horribly ill with Covid. He recovered after 2  long weeks in the hospital. That young man suffered terribly, not to mention the fear and anxiety his family endured.
1519666009652842497	@Gardner_LM @VP Was offered Paxlovid 3 days ago when I tested positive for Covid....horrible take with little or no research done, just a political agenda
1397727617508265985	Fun fact: I was actually treated in the hospital for mild myocarditis following a viral infection when I was 19. And now, there are reports of a very small number of kids developing it after the COVID-19 vaccine. https://t.co/1odE2NIZB7
1479626463221411840	If someone attack me for not social distancing they will end up in hospital, and it won’t be because of covid.
1376632793418117121	get tested for covid, mono, and the flu which all came back negative which means now i gotta go to the hospital and get my throat checked out and bloodwork done to figure out wtf is going on, get my sickness treated, BEFORE I CAN EVEN GET MY OVARY FIXED. BEFORE I CAN EVEN STEP-
1378402525905313802	@EssexPR Remember Adam, deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Care home residents still being tested twice a week and unfortunately the elderly will always die so I’d question if any of those deaths were actually as a direct result OF covid.

1387455803595051008	@uk_biobank We knew we’d had COVID in Jan 2020 - hubby just had a positive test and I’m waiting for mine.
1382618540402823168	@ICMRDELHI I had given my sample for covid test on 11/04/2021, and received a sms contaning ID no. And I also download the pfd of same. On 13.04 I received a call from unknown number that Iam covid positive. Till now no sms Or pdf with details received. Please look into it.

Woman came in with a broken ankle, tested positive for COVID during what is now routine intake testing, and had to be transferred to the COVID unit. This despite that she had zero symptoms. She’s counted among the hospitalized.
1453444746383396875	@jomcqn @KirstieMAllsopp You do realise how lucky you were that none of you 'put pressure' on the NHS when you had COVID? Any one of you, or all 5 of you, could have ended up in hospital. I have no idea what the rest of your tweet means. I hope it doesn't mean that the 5 of you declined to be vaccinated.
1379500900943757312	@ichaydon  I know a nurse in charge of Covid hotel at yvr. Arriving passengers had tested negative before boarding. Now at airport new test. Some are testing positive. Some say they have been fully vaccinated. Can you please explain how this happens.
1481056537544212485	I love all these major corporations saying employees “called out sick” when they’ve tested positive for COVID. The language being used is very intentional to try and give it a negative connotation. Could phrase it to say are safely quarantining, or adhering to CDC recommendation.
1486214208740270080	@qrsupport Hello, I have my flight on 28th of this month from mumbai to cincinnati. I have been tested covid positive and unable to travel.I cancelled the ticket but is not refelecting nor received any emails. Could you please check the DM

It’s now 82 in 2021, against criteria that would make a pathologist weep.Where are the Nightingales?  Shut.Plan Bollocks? PR stunt.
1541875646858776578	@Camper_girl Go girl, I ordered a couple from https://t.co/CwmKdxfeRa for my holiday. I love them, just didn't bank on coming home and testing positive for COVID. Tested negative while away and thought it was a chest infection 🫣
1448047818934005763	I have been tested 8 times for Covid. Someone in our classroom tested positive for Covid so Covid lost two weeks of my days at work because I have not taken the s—t. None of this makes since. They don’t intend for it too.
1429158152952369161	having the loml hospitalized with Covid is the scariest thing I’ve felt in a long time . 🥺

1448830200075096067	@zeynepmyenisey I like how anytime someone of significance is hospitalized they have to put if it was from Covid or not. Pretty ridiculous. Another reason we're never going to get over or out of Covid-land, it's nonstop talked about in the media.
1480953586884485131	If my covid test comes back positive and I’m stuck here I will cry
1365334812903567361	Impressive showing for #COVID vaccines......except that in the placebo group, only ~40 folks were hospitalized for #CoronaVirus--meaning that the #vaccine eliminates an already-slim 1 in 4375 possibility.I'd take a #COVIDVaccine--but outside of high-risk demos, it's unneeded.
1481454731767992324	@CraigKellyMP I also put to you Craig that every day they are reporting to us COVID ‘cases’ but I believe these are just Positive test results - not those who are sick with the virus requiring case management/treatment. They need to tell the truth!
1482758488757526533	@nspector4 I don't think it's a distraction and I don't think they're necessarily getting COVID in hospital.With Omicron, the virus is everywhere and people arrive in hospital for other reasons, don't know they have it, aren't being treated for it but test positive. More data is better.
1483674886115454979	@DrEricDing Oh my lord this sounds painful. My great-nephew had a blood clot in his lung from covid. Thought he was having a heart attack and went to the ER. Luckily he is okay but on blood thinners.  We probably will see a lot of strange and scary things for years to come! 🤔🙄☹🥺
1478919803322736642	So I tested positive w/ Covid for the 2nd time (fully vaxd) regardless my 30th B- Day is Sunday and I feel super sad...Like sis was supposed to start her new 2nd job and make that bread but now I'm in bed watching Seinfeld. #covidbirthday
1334230081082978304	These anti-vax lobby are vile. I for one cannot wait to have the coronavirus vaccine and stop living in the fear of catching this horrible illness. G. went into hospital in a coma on Christmas day 1997 and I still remember the fear I felt every year /End https://t.co/ryVRpHzIDj

1453318979884179466	@pervocracy Free, easy, and it's really neat because they often also tell you what you actually had instead of COVID. Only time I've ever actually been diagnosed with a rhinovirus instead of the doctor just kinda shrugging and saying it's a flu or something.

1436083128754376705	@JackPosobiec The vaccines are not as effective against the Mu variant. About 25% of fully vaccinated folks are coming down with COVID.

1478479739719401482	@BryanGOdom76 I still think effective/easy testing is important for symptomatic people to have the option. I 100% agree that there is risk in life &amp; we all need to our make choices. But having a cheap/effective way to test for covid if you have symptoms would be a net positive for society, imo
1376619509876981763	Well just tested positive for COVID. although the news is rather negative I will look towards the positive spectrum of my recovery. There are plenty of films on @Shudder that I've been meaning to watch and now will have the time to do so.

1505662818745405441	@MISSION_is_life Best response I’ve heard is… walk up to that person, remove your mask and right to their face say, I tested positive for COVID yesterday. 😉😷
1483954628832083968	No bcs it's so hard for me to feel sympathy for ppl who get admitted to the hospital for covid and blatantly refused to get the vaccine like🤠
1387897265524809729	"I personally know of 3 people who have died of other reasons, but labelled as ""covid"" regardless on the back of a positive test result..My best mate knows of 2 others..That's 5 between me and a mate of the 127, 502 since March 2020.  Does anyone else know of anyone..?"

But I've been double vaccinated &amp; double boosted, symptoms are mild &amp; I really appreciate your concern. I'm doing well, getting a lot of work done,"" @POTUS says. ""Keep the Faith, it's going to be okay"""
1389261889981591553	@LorcaDamon @LynneSchmidt @shaindelr Oh buzz off. People are getting the same shit with the jab, don't disregard it. They diagnosed me with a coronavirus family strain back in September 2019, it was awful, still not getting the dangerous jab.
1385742394075795456	An update on my stepbrother: He had to go to the ER because his COVID symptoms worsened. Doctor told him he's on the verge of pneumonia. They gave him an inhaler and sent him home.
1429842208329510920	@VincentRK MEDFAST just told me there is a covid test shortage so unless you are having symptoms they can’t test you.  Even though another person in our house just tested positive.  So you have to lie about symptoms to get a test done.  Welcome to Florida where lying IS the best policy.
1412861782197211145	When you make a joke to your boss that you’ll need time off to recover from the football hangover tomorrow, but test positive for covid the night of the game 💀 I wouldn’t believe me either 🥴
1392925319351267331	@HirokoTabuchi @AdamHSays I had my two Moderna vaccines and was diagnosed with Covid today. A mild case they say, but pretty sick.
1503361783310041091	@MichelleObama I heard your husband was diagnosed with covid i may have not agreed with his politics but I hope he feels better soon
1594756087554904064	@NahasNewman Un vaccinated due to previous GBS from vaccination, very unpleasant. I’ve not been sick and never tested positive for covid. Recently spent time staying in houses of covid positive people, helping out, nothing. I even stayed home for a couple days “ just in case”. Nat immunity?
1372895553693028363	@RubixxRose So you’re telling me if you were releasing a album tonight and DDG was in the hospital you would just drop everything and go? No I don’t believe it. Also with all the Covid shit he probably can’t even be in there.
1438908914209263621	@grantshapps Can you please explain why NATURAL IMMUNITY having had Covid-19 in April 2020 is not classed as an alternative to the Jab. I have tested POSITIVE for antibodies 4 times since my infection and have worked in a hospital with Covid patients all this time and have not been reinfected
1444061806222364677	I am though actually glad for the pill. It will hopefully help us get back to normal life. Get sick (even if you are vax'd) take a pill. Pill doesn't work, go to hospital and get an infusion  lenzilumab. The one two punch may make Covid death a rare occurence.
1525533883759853568	@Smoomier Have you been tested for Covid? I tested positive for Covid yesterday and have been experiencing similar symptoms.
1426358263835242496	@DonaRisley @GeorgeTakei Did I read that right ? So you have it  you shouldn’t be able to go to hospital for treatment, if you’re vaccinated there would be no need to ever go to hospital with Covid , so what would all the medical staff do because hasn’t the flu and cold been eliminated from society now ?
1410891492290297862	Tell yunho I love him too :( n that he brings me so much joy while I work in hospital everyday facing covid 🥺 #YUNHO @ATEEZofficial

1553623114138910722	Tested positive for COVID on Tuesday night.  Been taking paxlovid (like POTUS) and just tested negative.  I NEVER want to do this again. Thank God I’m vaxxed.

1384933270048100354	4.8% of arrivals from India tested positive for Covid (bear in mind there (still is) no hotel quarantine for arrivals from India)That's a huge proportion.I wonder what this figure is from other countries.
1483926140624453637	@joehaden23 I hope my Chiefs just wait..its covid out here,  all we need is one of our star players out on the town and come back with a positive covid test.  But yes, no drunk driving! 🖤❤💛GoChiefs
1507071606790758400	sorry I haven’t been here 😔 I’m very sick rn, waiting on pcr test results but considering half my department, 30 seventh-graders and 12 teachers are off with covid, I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s positive 🤧 everything aches and I’m trying to sleep through it more than anything
1467396149577502722	@chomisto @Selbybok You put your faith in Nonsensical things.I tested positive for COVID 2 weeks ago, I had no symptoms and felt nothing. I have never vaccinated, but I recovered without even taking any medicine.So you see, you have been brainwashed to believe the vaccine works.
1375641258350247937	@ATHOMEActivism @CP24 Ok so tell me who sits in a room with 30 kids who are unmasked eating lunch?  While you chew on that here are the lungs of a teacher in icu who got covid fromA student. She’s 35 https://t.co/UNCkVJHpek
1553341903709560832	It looks like ASA is a no go for me this year. After 10 bed ridden days of Covid, and still testing positive, it seems as though even if I test negative soon my health will not be good enough to risk being around so many people. Anyways get vaxxed, wear a mask, and stay safe!
1475791923222917124	one of the girls at work was banging on about ‘my partner has covid’ and then she tested positive 😐😐 ive never been so mad
1432861163621126144	I’m on @united flight UA 64 from Newark to Lisbon and crew IS NOT enforcing mask policy. So all passengers are at risk to be stranded abroad due to a positive Covid test
1385908244275736578	@cdav60 @kimKBaltimore @mdj17 I’m 62 and was tested positive 3 weeks ago. If it wasn’t “COVID” I would have gone about my life as usual. Now my body has its own immunity.
1557752341821935616	@stogba @JamieSale opinions are freedom of speech. Her is ultimate question. Did people die FROM covid or did they die WITH covid. HUGE DIFFERENCE. I know people that went to hospital with unrelated ailments and mandatory test was positive for covid. So they were classified as covid patients.
1480637840438566921	@ManiacalV @ScottLa42520398 @NW_StayDet Don’t pay him no mind.  He is my stalker. He is convinced that Covid is a PSYOP, that all the data about the sick is false, that the goal here is control. Oh, and that Covid is going to poof disappear, as soon as Biden stops paying for the (Covid) hospitalized.
1373803064424022017	@lindal4615 @donwinslow I live in North FL which isnt much better..missed my vax appt ..was in hospital..not covid thankfully.. will reschedule, get both doses and still wear masks..  only outing I want is to get my covid hair cut off!
1470902473795805185	@itsallboutdi56 @PrisonPlanet And the vaccine is working well for everyone I know.  We have remained COVID-free, and I know if I do wind up getting it I won't wind up in the hospital and on a ventilator, like you may.  I'd hate to have that hanging over my head.
1451343414474203141	What is the point of the vaccine if we still must wear masks and are unable to visit loved ones in nursing homes/hospitals if they test positive for COVID?! I will risk getting a damn cold if it means being with my loved one before they pass away! No one deserves to die alone!
1445349669413003266	ICYMI: One from me: Pa. Health Dept.: More than 14K new #COVID19 cases over the weekend; more than 2,700 hospitalized https://t.co/sOUeHImEvV via @PennCapitalStar #PaPolitics

1354441649804488704	@StevenZweibel @DBelardoMD I had my first Pfizer vaccine on 1/12 and tested positive for antibodies today. Have never had COVID (or exposure of any kind) - only the vaccine.

I’m sharing this to tell you there are conditions that could be totally unrelated to COVID or could be results of COVID not yet understood.
1384850060823957508	@ARanganathan72 How is the govt getting this data ? In the form we fill for testing covid, this question is NOT asked ..I have tested positive more than a month after taking the 2 doses, though symptoms are not severe
1422463046774108174	@riseOvoices @ReneLaw08 Remdesivir is an ARV &amp; it is successful at fighting Covid. I just had a patient in hospital in a 3rd world country who was treated with 5 injections over 5 days, he recovered &amp; he is home now - after being very ill at home for 3 weeks.HIV anti viral meds are working on COVID!
1606788529753059328	only I would test positive for covid the day before christmas
1422975548234498048	I tested positive for covid the day Los Angeles opened back up.

1481377614069743618	Dear @MayorWu: my job as a psych resident right now is to determine if a person is a danger to themselves/others. If not, it's to tell them they can't be admitted to the hospital and need to be discharged-often to the street. If COVID+, there's near nowhere to go. We need help.
1512031061651619841	"@theipaper @TomChivers ""Still do they job, imperfectly but effectively"" ? I am truly not so sure about that.

1442993178064261124	@ron_cassie @LisaMcCray Def a lot of anxiety that is unaddressed.   My kid is quarantining because of close contact with a student who tested positive.   He basically said if he gets COVID he will die.
1384912079258365954	I missed this Controversy in Neurology on #telehealth because I was doing it for my patient who is currently in the hospital for post-#COVID #Dysautonomia. #Telehealth is the key to better care of patients with chronic illness. Will be watching it on #AANAM rewind. @AANMember https://t.co/Mv64op9BNW
1550274088161214464	So if he test positive then doesn’t she have to quarantine?  Isn’t that how it worked for the rest of us.  I could be wrong. My COVID decoder ring never worked right.
1607440366898393090	@ToddLaudy Yes it’s like 2+ years old I was following,then it got censored he is legit! There is NO Covid test its why the PCR tests were run at higher cycles should be 17-20 BUT THEY did 37-40 which Kary Mullis inventor of PCR test says run it that high it will be positive for anything!
1388438058031321091	@Angelsfeartogo I have a team in Delhi and Goa and they have not seen any hysteria one bit. One of them was in hospital this week with Denge fever, tested positive for covid regardless and got oxygen very easily. He's back to work on Monday. Don't believe the media hype

1471992180285841414	We need to lose the narrative that getting Covid means you've been reckless or unsafe. I know so many who have taken every single precaution, never stopped wearing masks, got the vaccine and didn't go to big events who tested positive. Be kind. Nobody wanted this.
1362198658754691074	COVID-19 FAQ: After getting a COVID-19 vaccine, will I test positive for COVID-19 on a viral test? No. Neither the recently authorized COVID-19 vaccines nor others currently in clinical trials in the United States can cause you to test positive on viral tests. #COVID19 #vaccine https://t.co/LHjwpbb5Qb

1394196447684440064	@DonalPHanley @deniscoakley11 To conclude,  if I come by plane with negative test and no symptoms and several days later I test positive in the hotel, it is legitimate to wonder where did I catch Covid? Likely in the hotel itself. There is no way to prove it I caught it on the plane.

1337156734939500544	Let me make sure I've got this right....#Covid19 has 2 names?It's killing people?People who tested positive don't die?People who get intubated die?We need a vaccine?Taking the vaccine has complications?We can't shop without the vaccine?We can't fly without the vaccine? https://t.co/xnyOTUHyRb
1508603991558701056	Btw sorry for the lack of streams.I haven't been feeling too good at the moment cause I tested positive for covid. And just overall in general haven't been feeling 100% myself.  But I'll try stream minecraft tomorrow to make up for it &lt;3
1483890884060061701	@HowardStern I downgraded my Sirius today, I think you are a fool.  You are spreading misinformation on Covid, it’s roughly 50/50 vax to unvax in the hospital.  The cdc stated yesterday that zero vaccines work on Omnicron, and saying that the unvax should not get care is
1431519687742005249	@natthetaurus we just had a covid case. the person was sitting less than ten feet away from me and they didn’t let me quarantine. i’m fully vaccinated but i have bad asthma and i would likely end up in the ICU so i’m still really careful
1603969426843484160	@himtuition it’s my positive covid test 🧍🏾‍♀️
1485144973846904832	"Recently i saw a tweet by someone who said ""He has been tested COVID positive"". Surprisingly there were 76 likes for it 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔"
1452594037039456258	I’ve known 3 people firsthand who have tested positive for #COVID19 with symptoms for 7+ days after being fully vaccinated vs. 1 person before vaccines. Just an anecdote. #Unvaccinated #vaccine
1435240307780689922	@MikeStuchbery_ walked away. My parting shot: if you get Covid, don't go to hospital.
1509977487207448579	"The speaker spoke at the ABNY breakfast on Wednesday in front of a large crowd. Also, one of @NYCMayor's aides said after his briefing earlier today that ""a couple"" of people in City Hall have tested positive from COVID recently. So I assume Adrienne Adams isn't the only one?"
1524562483641470976	@washingtonpost I've never had COVID. I've never had the jab. I was in a car with windows up, no masks on, and my (jabbed X3) passenger was coughing and sneezing for the entire 2-hr ride. My passenger tested positive for COVID. I'm in healthcare, so got tested: NEGATIVE.
1388801351518457856	@ptexpat Thank you! He had dementia too. The COVID illness must have been very frightening for him since he was in hospital and he wouldn't have recognized anyone. Both illness are very cruel.I didn't realize that robins could get so tame. Today's Google search: best bird food.
1373545692086423552	It's a blessing to have gotten my 1st dose!  For those like me with immune systems that don't work, the past year has been terrifying!  I would NOT do well if I got COVID.  So even if I get any other side effects, that's nothing compared to being in the ICU!
1480588027319787520	I’ve been critical of the CDC, but this isn’t a list of COVID comorbidities - ICD-10 codes are just a big list of “things you could ever possibly be diagnosed with,” and this is just a report of all diagnoses anyone who died of COVID had. It isn’t intended to explicitly link them
1516896602392256512	@LazarusLong13 @Loretta_Torrago I'd take ANY data that Hoeg clown shares with a grain of salt. And more than being hospitalized, remember, being vaccinated/boosted reduces your chances of long covid...or reduces it in some way. Take that into account. No matter age, I'd see no reason to not get boosted.
1456083767467126789	Found out our high schooler has TESTED POSITIVE FOR Covid. Now we are all quarantined and will be tested tomorrow. Im afraid. Yes we all had the vaccine except for him.
1480400236019261444	NY Rep. Ocasio-Cortez recovering after positive COVID test | AP NewsOh, did she get that in t/drag Queen bar in FL, not wearing a mask while yapping for everyone else to do that ? Also triple vaxed ? Some poetic justice I see 🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/s7vnXPAg6U
1478612880559775744	My in laws just tested positive for COVID
1387522617729552394	@SamFazeli8 @YuanPotts If there is a ~3 times greater risk of ending up in the ICU from Covid for the 30-39 cohort (at current low infection rates) than from blood clots... I’m not really following why it’s too big a risk?Especially when Van-Tam indicated today that bottom is in for infection rate
1381760886361194501	@Nogame4321 I’m late to the party. What happened to make you go to the hospital? COVID, some other thing? Btw, right back at ya, get better soon!
1437452433232470017	a yr ago i went 2 an addy in montbello and a week later i tested positive w covid lol ever since i have not partied now i’m antisocial and get tired of being around so much ppl😂
1396345089933381638	@billmaher So you got a vaccine and then tested positive for covid.... funny, I never thought of you to be a poster boy for Fauci... or are you paying a penance like a good boy?
1415329451500445704	Everyone needs to wake up! One of my clients who has been vaccinated for Covid just tested positive. She barely leaves the house. ☹️ #covidisnotover https://t.co/uogysVCFZ3
1433940318634848256	@SenRonJohnson I have never tested positive and have never been sick at all with Covid symptoms.
1447329236474286083	@CmkMk7 @VeronikaIzabela False. Just got tested a month ago at LabCorp. $52, found out I did have antibodies within a day. Positive for antibodies a year after a light case of covid.
1476637305888665602	@2Zukirex @COOLERTHANUOBVS @WUTangKids I'll say that, what if it is a treatment that works against Covid? I won't go to the ER cause the virus isn't that bad for me, so don't worry about your Healthcare in my case lol. 🤷🏽‍♂️
1377703072147857408	For April Fools Day, my doctor told me I tested positive for COVID.  Real funny, doc.
1375828092078465036	My grandad tested positive for covid but my granny was tested and it came back negative, so then they tested my grandad again and it was negative yet he has been taken to hospital and put on a covid ward! 😩
1550527666863984648	Just tested Covid positive! I 🥺
1440653944078823427	To some extent... rationing is already happening. A patient hospitalized with covid might have benefited from a machine, known as an ECMO machine... “The reality is I can’t staff that,” Baxter said. “Do you give that optimal care to 1 patient or do you give great care to 5?”
1477451164673363968	@AvalancheEvents @johnharveygtfb @dolan_lee @RobertS66021134 @AvonandsomerRob All in ICU for COVID and COVID only and would not be there if they were vaccinated. I know that doesn’t fit your false narrative but those are the facts. Believe what you like personally, but please stop spreading anti vax misinformation that puts lives at risk.
1382664507751854082	@ChuckWendig When I got vaccinated, the relief I felt wasn't that I wouldn't catch covid, but that I wouldn't need to be hospitalized or that I would die if I did. I don't LOVE being sick, but I'm not afraid of an illness if I know it's short-term.
1457997463529431043	@RobertonEsther @nhsfife Oh Esther I am so sorry you have both tested positive for Covid. Stay safe. You are both in my thoughts. X
1420867632463585285	@charlesarthur @JamesMelville @BernieSpofforth I am curious as to why there is an enormous abundance of people of our age and below currently in hospital with serious covid and double jabbed. I do wonder if this is as effective as we are less to believe. I have an open mind. I wish that you’re right, but I fear you’re not :-(
1546237218171535360	@zindagichist Feel better bakahir . My symptoms started 6 days before my positive COVID test . The incubation period I believe is around that time so keep getting tested and bakhair you feel better .
1480682336278695947	4 days since @TheSultan86 tested positive for covid. Think I got a bit cocky with my negatives as I’m now starting to feel very meh. 🤞🏼 they stay negative and this is just a cold🙈😂
1461070777202139138	@JeremyVineOn5 I'll leave others to argue the moral case.The scientific/statistical elephant in the room is this from the @ONS A person who has had Covid and recovered (identifiable by antibody test) is as unlikely to test positive again as someone who has had 3 doses of Pfizer vaccine https://t.co/GzcYTz8sMa
1545109424175398912	@brish_ti I’ve heard, “I’ve got the flu - not Covid because I didn’t test positive”&amp; “it’s bronchitis because I didn’t get a positive test” all week. One person I know jumped on a plane, three days with symptoms, but no positive test.  Lots of protesting from me but they still went. 🤬🤬🤬

1445081796232814595	@theipaper I can't see any rules for those who have survived covid and have natural immunity.  With proof through positive PCR and antibodies test.  What's the rule for them as they are the safest of any people but don't see any mention of it???

1538175784925405184	@jadedcreative I’m celebrating the ending with a positive Covid test this morning.  So much winning!
1454875665157795842	@Laurie_Garrett I read about a couple of patients who tested positive for Covid for over a year. Very disturbing 😳
1340372641920724992	Got my #COVID19 vaccine to protect myself in hospital/procedures; &amp; my pts, family &amp; community.I am humbled by everyone who made this possible. I'm a brown female doctor, scientist &amp; advocate. I trust the vaccine is safe &amp; will protect us!#ThisIsOurShot #IGotTheShot #MaskUp https://t.co/7BoUP6hsyF
1429604897297616897	So a huge part of my family has been diagnosed with covid &amp; young healthy folks are hospitalized &amp; not expected to make it.
1367929030796787713	@RandyRRQuaid Texas nurse here.  I’m appalled at the a number of people who won’t protect the vulnerable.  You know babies &amp;children can’t get the vaccine, right?  Wear a mask to protect them.  Also don’t come to hospital if u don’t wear a mask &amp; get Covid.  Thx
1425191431216447488	@Mavumavu91 Reaction, at least I’d only have it once. And indeed, that’s exactly what happened. But one of the things I was told before making the decision (&amp; again in the ER) was that if I got Covid, my reaction to the drugs &amp; intubation would likely have killed me. So if you’re afraid 2/3
1446183743769792516	@AnnaKotovaOx Get tested- I was certain it was overwork and marking fatigue last week. Positive covid test yesterday 🙄
1430567804865064960	My Covid test came back positive. Vaccinated, always mask, vigilant to a fault. I have not been horribly sick but enough that I’ve been pretty miserable and whiny. And a bit dramatic.  Seriously, you don’t want this.
1607481710228242433	@TaraBull808 @MarioNawfal I was in the hospital with Covid pneumonia and almost died. I was given Remdesivir and that is why I almost died. My husband demanded that a pulmonologist doctor be assigned to my case and the docs at first said, “no need for that”. My husband demanded it again and that
1456000176162758658	@TheChiefNerd Took my kids to get Covid tested.Nurse said she had to send 5 young people to the ER in the past week who had serious side effects since getting vaxxed.What is the risk for young people to get hospitalized with Covid VS to have serious side effects from the shot?
1479447536356057095	I was tested positive with #COVID a week back and have been in quarantine. Have had no fever in last 4 days, hoping to be out soon. During quarantine as well I made sure I exercised and stayed positive.#FitBusinessPeople#FitnessMotivation#COVID19#PositiveEnergy https://t.co/eFTba0Pfuj
1471952507345776650	@KatiePavlich @TheFive @NBSaphierMD I’m not trying to be a wise guy here but why if you are vaccinated or if you were previously diagnosed with and recovered from COvid, would you get tested IF YOU WERE SYMPTOM FREE?Am I missing something?
1485199723506057222	I was tested covid positive btw. But strange enough, I'm not scared. 1 of 3 tested people in my country are being tested positive so... 🤷‍♀️
1452824080567218176	@PegLulu2 Good for you! I always wear mine, but few around me do. I do it for them, not for me! A couple of months back I tested positive for Covid and was asymptomatic. I could have unknowingly infected people if I had not been wearing my mask. I want to walk up to people and tell them.
1417528825152303107	At my hotel there is a young lady who works the breakfast bar &amp; makes the coffee. Her voice is sounds like her vocal chords have been worked over. She native Hawaiian. I asked this morning why her voice sounds so rough. She lived in ICU for two months on a vent because of COVID.
1438182746560483329	@JasonOnTheDrums I guess it might come down to the UCP/covid16 (or however MLAs are in that camp now.)Are enough ABns being hospitalized for them to take covid seriously or are they so diehard in their denial that any announced restrictions/passport will cause them to defect?
1427556029026291722	@lawriechap This is Imani. His name means faith. He recently kept me company while in hospital for major abdominal surgery. W/Covid we didn’t know if they’d let David visit me and we knew I’d need emotional support. He is good at it. I’m sharing him and his love w/you Lawrie. He is safe 💛💛 https://t.co/uOyWAx3Jaa
1383879986994552839	"So here's a problem: in January WHO/CDC redefined a ""Case"" of COVID to only be someone who is sick, i.e., with symptoms diagnosed by a doctor. The change is instantly noticable in chart 1. However, they didn't revise all the previous cases that were merely test based, chart 2. https://t.co/dH24v6wwHr"
1487880805812690946	Ive had covid this month- but dh did not test positive: So- as the title says. Due to fly in a few weeks time I was positive at a drive through govt testing site. Dh did not take this test. (dh only… https://t.co/uYGkQIWGps
1426219509044551680	@WineWit1 @MarcusBeam1 @raypal @kerpen I believe I read it is done via testing that produces a positive for Covid and then the sample is genome tested.
1614667220180926464	@RealDJTrumpNews 2022 was the worst year of my life, mostly because I was in the hospital twice. They could have slipped in the jab in my IVs or with the test swab (if Alex Jones was right). But if not, I'm still pure. Covid negative.
1375927737018417152	So I went a whole year without getting Covid. Low and behold I test positive this week. Let me tell you it sucks for someone being as active as I am having to not do anything.
1520628245439434752	Wanna make a bet? I bet there are at least a dozen people in that room who will test positive for Covid in the next two weeks who will THEN say “it would be worse if I wasn’t vaccinated” 🤨🤨🤨
1458120543555686412	@CashApp $ecraig2002 , I’m in dire need of money right now. I just got diagnosed with covid a couple days ago and I guess I got a pretty bad case of it. I’m going to be out of work for awhile… so I need all the money I can get. Anything is appreciated ♥️
1526642619425726465	I am stupid question: if I was exposed to someone who tested positive for covid, but I've had the virus and have had all the shots and boosters, I'm not a huge carrier right? I have people around me at home I'll avoid, but they have all had it or at least had their shots too.
1484891783201017863	@GlenWebb74 @HusseinRifai8 @NovakDjokovicL Also has a mind of his own when he tested positive for Covid, yet the next day was taking pictures with fans &amp; doing interviews with L’Eqipe magazine. I’m a fan, but let’s get some balance here. He was irresponsible.
1431289229590605825	@GolGotha_33 @sarah_allsop @SkyNews The risk of a clot is far, far higher from Covid infection than the vaccine.  In my local Hospital 32 patients have Covid,  7 of whom are in ICU.  Out of those only 1 patient had, been vaccinated!
1596983945173733378	"@nathaliejacoby1 I am vaxed and double boosted and have never ""tested"" positive for covid.  I simply have not put myself in the position to contract it however."
1335992756863447041	@sw_atkins @mikeparker37 @DPJHodges I’d say Covid presents a lot of long term health issues. Including ending up on a ventilator in hospital. So I’ll take my chances with a vaccine, thanks.
1424739794505150468	someone just posted a pregnancy test positive on their twitter and i thought it was a covid test lol
1340632582275428353	@SaltaoVladimir @ScienceShared I’m not suggesting the vaccine would make you test positive, but will you test positive if you have had the vaccine and then come into contact with Covid ?
1437066737132847107	@tulpabeing @MichaelPSenger They aren't mandating elderly to get vaccinated, the ones who are hospitalized &amp; dying from Covid-19. I'm against forced vaccines for anyone. But the people who are, are ignoring people who would benefit the most from the vaccine if it worked. Wouldn't it lower deaths?
1509273811455254538	I've managed to avoid COVID for the past two years but finally tested positive today https://t.co/f5RLbgXOlV
1480331961059229698	@katnkevin2001 @catturd2 I have personally known 7 people who had Covid. 2 were hospitalized, with age ( in his 70's) and weight, ( in her 60's) being a factor. They all survived. 2 were vaxxed. 5 were not. I will trust my own experience and information.
1471315031342026755	@cnnbrk Not a joke question, but how many of these university students are hospitalized or, heaven forbid, died of Covid? Think I can hazard a guess
1469079632150503426	@bbcquestiontime How would you have reduced deaths by covid?  Let's not forget if I killed you in a car but you had a covid positive test in the previous 28 days, that's a covid death.
1477435675758632965	@PhilipVasquez @joerogan My family is HUGE &amp; we have 90 some year Olds to protectEveryone but two young adults got vaccinated &amp; Boosted So far only those two young men got Covid - only one was hospitalized, both survivedMost of the family is in the medical or teaching field so praying for all of them
1407030297544253441	@680NEWS Interesting. The propaganda video I was forced to sit through to keep my job, stated that people who have been vaccinated against covid don't become hospitalized or die from covid 🤔https://t.co/tXU9SaU0VX
1373638754938814467	@necrobranson I tested positive for Covid and I was waking up with blurry vision, so I wondered out loud to my housemate if that was a symptom of Covid, then realized that it was probably because I was hungover because I was spending pretty much every waking moment drunk as hell.
1488578607127703558	Look up the side effects oh and for real I had covid and was in the hospital.  Believe what you want ro believe
1436337422032416770	@BlaccAngelle 1 of my neighbours caught covid, currently in hospital on oxygen.How she got it is that as a retiree, her little bar was a necessary source of income. So the little illegal gatherings was gow she made ends meet.So in her head dead from covid, dead from hunger..same dead🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️
1385038246346956802	@bethanyshondark Honestly, when I tested positive for COVID last year the fear and anxiety of getting it was worst than the actual virus. I was an absolute wreck......not from the actual virus but the fear.
1441790108282281986	@TheBabylonBee The Trump-inspired GOP is functioning as a terrorist organization.  Currently, COVID-19 enabling, election misinformation and voter suppression are its primary weapons.  Our democracy is in peril.I bet the 1900 who are currently hospitalized right now with COVID are partying!
1519060357163016192	Today, I didn't test positive for COVID-19 because I didn't have any symptoms so I didn't take a test for a fake virus with a fake test reporting fake metrics for a fake agenda to sell fake vaccines. Now, what's for lunch?
1474500550905323534	Annnnd I tested positive for Covid 🧔🏽👎🏽
1435723995324821504	@cotter_dave @JakeAnbinder I just verified that those data are correct. And they look very good. In Massachusetts, only 2 of every 10,000 vaccinated people are being hospitalized with Covid and only 4 of every 100,000 are dying from it.
1612187607101734913	@shane1475 @duke_canuck @CTVNews Well for starters latest figures in my province show you have the greatest chance of dying or being hospitalized from Covid if you have 3 or more shots. Greater chance than unvaxxed.
1414247468288516096	@drmwarner @DFisman If I was admitted to hospital for a non covid related issue, my question to my nurse would be are you fully vaccinated, if no pls send a nurse that is. That's highly dangerous especially with Delta
1480873985482973187	@derekkerton @j_g_allen @olgakhazan Another anecdote: My husband went to Indiana mid-December to see family. 14 people, 3 indoor events, 13 unmasked, 12 Covid (including one hospitalized for 2 weeks). My husband wore his N95s and was boosted. No Covid.
1387503879609257994	@LBC I seem to remember when Cummings went to #BarnardCastle was when #BorisTheLiar was diagnosed with #COVID19 after shaking hands with everyone in #NHS hospital.  He took the virus back to heart of Govt, cabinet ministers became infected. my point is Cummings must have been angry.
1559442336383467521	"Lloyd Austin, head of the #Pentagon, said in a statement on Monday, ""Today, my corona test came back positive"", I have mild symptoms and will be quarantined for the next five days according to the instructions of the #US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. https://t.co/OuhT9IpSLF"
1375470135918612490	@keder Fauci is not elected. He’s not the person I want to hear on TV. He shouldn’t set policy. I want the governor or president to tell me: How many people on Medicaid died from Covid cost overruns? How many people we not admitted to hospital? How many were sent to hospice?
1426172498249388034	I don’t get why the anti-vaxxers who don’t believe in science keep showing up to the hospital when they catch Covid looking for the science there to help them.
1349891293279764482	I'm not happy to hear that a NY representative was diagnosed with COVID-19 even after he received the vaccine. Like what's the point in taking the vaccine then?!!!!! 😶

1476569266132598791	@happypuppy84 @ronmortgageguy @BBC Oh thank god, I was really worried when I saw 1200 people per day being admitted to the hospital for covid. Glad to hear they all just have the sniffles and some just need a ventilator to clear up a bit of nasal congestion. Let’s wait till it gets really bad to do anything.
1516227049320501248	@janet_halpin @Dave61164 You don’t even know this person! Or the area where she lives or what the covid situation is there.

1336388107235692545	@timspector @GSTTnhs I’ve asked this question 4 times now with no answer and today I heard disquieting comments from a Professor on LBC saying “not one person in the vaccine trials previously had Covid”. Question: I’ve tested positive for antibodies, is it safe for me to be Vaccinated.
1490778138661502977	guys, i tested positive for covid :(((
1476649029853491200	@RWranglebury Covid didn't kill me. Covid didn't put me in hospital.Purely personal circumstance.
1560017116954337282	How many other folks have definitely had COVID (symptoms, living with positive case), but consistently tested negative on rapid tests?(I've had COVID since at least Thursday and have yet to test positive, but my partner's COVID test line is DARK and immediate)
1461127863017656327	@LoriAHiggins The ones who don’t live in Detroit can come and join me any Thursday morning around 7:30am when I drive to house to inform families that their child tested positive for Covid. It’s so easy to criticize when you haven’t walked 10ft in our shoes.
1506766225682370561	@ChrisMinnsMP I'm old enough to remember being told by the world's medical EXPERTS that once 'fully' vaccinated ( 2 jabs) you couldn't catch Covid or pass it on. Strange then that so many double and triple jabbed are home or in hospital with Covid. 🤔🤔
1422210201902624772	@obenigsen @heather_bjustme @Waldo56 @NYTScience I wish I could share how many of my anti-vax Covid patients in ICU suddenly want a vaccine.  All of a sudden these geniuses see the light.  Way too late.
1439752753799221250	@SheilaGunnReid Nah. Feels great. Upper class In a sorta way. Peasant below getting Covid and hospitalized. It cost me nothing to get that freedom, just a shot.
1475344000152342531	@leoniebc @AusDemocracyPls @websyd @noplaceforsheep Definitely agree. If you are a close/primary contact, I’d suggest wait three days. My entire family had covid and our learning was the amount of time required for positive test result
1473705743559835655	4 people out  tested positive for covid..i really came back to the ghettoo😑
1481252623504138243	The other day i asked my bf what he was gonna get me for Valentine’s Day and he said nothing a Covid test, not so funny now that I’m positive is it you little shit head
1384811506819375104	@TuckerCarlson the vaccine does work, I have had both shots, was exposed by my wife who tested positive.  Two COVID tests later the result was negative.  Plus, had another Monday again negative.  Stop spreading deadly lies.

1383985022344986626	@Recook63Russell You are in severe pain for over a week before detected.. Covid brought it on.. So I had both problems the same time.. Shingles were mild case but the pain on the backside of hip, was not diagnosed till you break out.. Didn't sleep for almost a week.. Oxycodone didn't even help..
1473077899779575813	@K_Willzzz @missdjcandy @stephenbudd @OfficialSkribz If I test positive on January 1st and then get hit by a bus and die on January 19th I'll go down as a covid death? That's fair.

1373387352597540869	@RJ52BOY @lisakeb007 I'm sceptical of the 200k figure. Whistle blowers have already said Covid is put on death certificates when they didn't die of Covid. Deaths are being measured as deaths 'for any reason' within 28 days of a positive test. https://t.co/xiQlXG1ZlI
1554473885390835712	I think we have a right to know if “monkeypox” positive patients did or did not take the Covid 19 vaccine. Dr. Luc Montagnier said “if you’ve had 3 shots-go take an AIDS test”.Monkeypox lesions look suspiciously like AIDS lesions. It’s why they are blaming GAYS.Think for yourself

1538669327485763584	@SpringSteps @washingtonpost Misinformed,  weak, sniveling sheep. Only  dumbest of  dumb go to hospital for covid.

1377546840699252740	@MavericTV I had Covid, was hospitalized, out of work for 3 months and continue to experience symptoms. It is currently not advised by the multitude of doctors I see. Only FB &amp; Twitter certified docs recommend it. 🙄

1575170673315442690	@margal @Jollyra32691822 wishful thinking?  I am concerned for all these YOUNG HEALTHY people who were mandated to take something they didn't need to take, who lived through covid and never went to the hospital, or never got covid, until after the vaccines.
1380086198010589185	@Francis_Hoar I know one person who died of covid. She fell down the stairs then caught covid in hospital Hospitals are still failing with basic infection control it seems Very basic things like cleanliness and nutritional food are still missing 😕
1553386118401429504	@POTUS Yea to worry the uneducated. Before COVID-19 there was many other corona virus that were more as weak as common colds Im sure those at I HYPOTHESIZE Home test are NOT sensitive to identify what Corona your positive for. 6 yrs experience reading RVP(RespViraPanel)for a long time.

There's a difference of dying WITH COVID vs DYING FROM COVID!Dr. Birx said they were taking the liberal approach &amp; counting them as COVID if tested positive.Why no autopsies? @POTUS @VP https://t.co/RL7Oul8EGQ
1361761941073625089	Just tested positive for COVID because my roommate refused to get the vaccine. Last night I was in some of the worst pain of my life. Would’ve been eligible for the vaccine yesterday, but now I have to wait three months after I test negative. Don’t be fucking stupid, guys.
1503209993897746432	@TheEliKlein I love your tweets. Don’t agree w/ this one. Data doesn’t lie. I know many who got Covid vaccinated, hospitalized, critical &amp; some who died. Know many unvax who recovered quickly. If you’re healthy you’ll be fine either way.
1561399898561425409	@marcuslemonis I was diagnosed with Covid so my medical bill‘s pretty high I would love if I could get some assistance with that 💙 #kindnesswithmarcus

They never wore masks in church at all 😖 Terrible... https://t.co/Uz3u8h2mbt
1297330049746644992	@jennay13 @DownerCj @USATODAY One of the reasons I worry about Covid with T1 diabetes is that the flu sent me to the hospital last year, and I had had the vaccine, too (every year, like clockwork, for this very reason - plain old flu can potentially be deadly for me).
1385986858144858116	@thehowie Agreed! I’m 37 &amp; got J&amp;J on 4/9 bc I’m allergic to an ingredient in mRNA vax. I was previously hospitalized bc a common medication with great safety profile caused me to get Stevens-Johnson syndrome. I would still get J&amp;J bc I have lung disease &amp; fear I would die if I got Covid.
1522021238721302528	@MR_F_B61_12 @MrSparklu @medriva What goes into the process to label someone dying of covid than some (possibly) eccentric comorbidity? They must be tested positive for covid right? Check and done. Within the past 30 days I believe?
1482176709286035461	So my roommate just tested positive to covid and I still have tonsillitis, which I’m now on antibiotics on for. So am I screwed? Yes, yes I am
1372639400497135621	@NYmom4 @jillagoldstein @BrianUFT @UFT Teens and children are more prone to the variants. They’re getting sick. It’s terrifying. I’ve had students hospitalized. You seem to think that because you’re bored with Covid that it’s gone.
1432169745441198080	@Carolyn84905526 @RonFilipkowski Yeah I don’t get his logic here. Says he tested positive and almost died…so what was that then? “Whatever they call Covid”…
1620064134086938624	@maliburoadmovie This is a fact And why i did not want to go to hospital with covid because the protocol of intubation and remdesivir was killing people But they kept using a protocol that wasn’t working 🤷🏼‍♀️
1377780443941113856	@MetroMayorSteve I was placed in and induced coma at  ICU @qehbham back in January 2021 after being diagnosed Covid pneumonia.

1431216834141900800	@Kareneve66 @Nightingale_31 Everyone is different. I've had flu and it's rough but Covid put me in hospital for 6 weeks (3 in ICU, one of them on a ventilator). I've been home 4 days and can barely climb the stairs to bed. Muscles/strength gone, taste/smell gone, appetite gone. Months of rehabilitation.

1434022864701767680	@Davegcr @globeandmail Yep they do, it means limiting my chances of getting covid, winding up in the hospital and more importantly lessening the chance of spreading it. I hope you are willing to ride this out at home and not waste health care workers time if you get covid.

1473644362068340739	@RexChapman I know roughly the same amount of vaxxed and unvaxxed people.  It's anecdotal, but in the 7 people I know have tested positive for Covid in the last couple months, 4 were vaxxed.  None of the 7 were seriously Ill. In fact, they were all about the same.
1444759258986389504	Ran into a buddy who refused to get vaccinated, got covid, lost his salaried gig and now is working part time retail.His buddy got covid and is still in the ICU.I wish I could feel some empathy.

1476467070305030145	Incredibly sad, and unacceptably horrible for the staff.And I can't help but think of the younger patient I saw ventilated in ICU, with a family still adamant that covid was a hoax.
1522660526916050944	@TheLaurenChen Neither my wife nor I got it, neither of us received the shot, and we have even been around people who tested positive a day later.  It's almost like we offended COVID as much as I offended Twitter before Elon Musk came along.

I'll pass. Its the vaxxed in hospital and dying from covid19.

1481323988815126533	NO SH&amp;^. I also have MANY fully vaxxed family members who've tested positive for COVID. @PressSec &amp; @POTUS responses would be:  they probably won't die because they're vaxxed. Most people under 65 have a 99%+ chance of NOT dying. Pandemic of the Unvaxxed?  How about Untreated?
1453047665550405638	@tristan2021 @SandraWeeden All I know is, that my partner, who was diagnosed with stage 4 lymphoma (blood cancer) in 2016, caught covid, was hospitalised for a month, but survived.

1420913462985768963	Let me tell you again about Ormond Beach Fl! If anybody has to go to the hospital you're screwed! The hospitals are full of covid patients! So everything was shut down a year ago in March so not to overwhelm hospitals! But now they just don't give a f***! This country is FUBAR!
1482284004346839042	@Andy_11_ @footballdaily @Carra23 @GNev2 @SkySports Generally I’d agree with comments like this, but when everyone has sacrificed something during COVID and No10 do the opposite, then I think we all have a right to make a comment.Remember this, BoJo was in ICU with it and this happens

1421148067315818504	@dimestore12 @KrisGoldsmith85 @USArmy p.s.  this means the PCR test never discerned between flu and covid. this means people who tested positive for the flu were told they have covid all last flue season. I'm not sure why you aren't celebrating the end of this innaccurate garbage test. liberals...
1435999101699641351	the amount of tweets/statuses i’ve seen of ppls family members getting covid + ppl not being able to go to the hospital cause they’re packed but watching u all go to these concerts and live life like covid numbers aren’t 4x worse than they were this time last year is fucking wild
1359981355287932930	@MFenderesky a colleague had positive covid test on Siren (not sure about antibodies) 4 weeks post vaccine. he was disappointed to be infected post vaccine. but zero symptoms! so thats a win against grim reaper as far as im concerned

1576157402348412928	I went to the hospital for a checkup. My doctor kept saying she is glad I am doing much better. She is happy I don’t have to come see her so often. There  is a rising number of hospitalization of COVID patients.Stay safe y’all 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿Get your bivalent vaccine
1527060889249009665	She’s an MD, and tested positive for COVID Monday.  Fully vaxxed and boosted.  Text from that night: I’m going to work from home. I’ve had colds worse than this.
1386817506988503043	Hey folks, I got vaccinated in early March and just tested positive for covid.  I feel like shit.  I can’t imagine how much worse I’d be if not for that.  Get your damn shot.
1557443250474176517	Well hell, hubby tested positive on Monday and I've been so careful staying away from him. Woke up with a cough this morning  just tested and it was positive.  3 years good,  damn covid! Apparently this one is highly contagious.. vaxed and double boosted. 😢
1526276843841650689	@JeffBezos How is it that I am agreeing with you? Did you test positive for COVID?
1583254871439863809	taking a nap with my positive covid test in my bed next to me 🖤
1403175055534694402	@WrestlinMatter The reason I think it has to be a storyline reason and not a Covid reason is because I'd like to believe that if either of them tested positive or had come in contact with someone that tested positive, that they wouldn't be wrestling each other due to safety procautions.
1525518988628959234	Still remembering that Fred claiming going into hospital for oxygen because his lungs were fucked by Covid wasn't a big deal. I wasn't hospitalised and it was still scary to not be able to breathe normally.
1468724661538144256	For the sake of transparency, I was eligible for my booster in late October and didn't get it. Instead I got a positive Covid test 2 days ago. I had my monoclonal antibody infusion this afternoon. Still feel relatively good. I'm grateful to have been vaxxed in the spring.
1476571794408501251	@livelovenofear The day before Christmas break, I was asked to help emergency cover a class for a “leadership” (double vaxxed) teacher who was sick and who got a positive Covid test that morning. Meanwhile, I’m over here living my best life, feeling great. 😉🙋🏻‍♀️👍❤️ https://t.co/MxcD5l04po
1428854029522767872	Shoutout to the person who came to my job right after being diagnosed with COVID because her time off was going to be wrong
1396776427299741696	@howshegoingehh @ksorbs I know, and I’m talking about people who tested positive for both, but covid is listed as a contributing factor due to, for example, respiratory issues and somehow flu and pneumonia isn’t. That makes zero sense.
1512203344068202507	Cautionary COVID tale for those who get medical advice from @tedcruz or @RepCawthorn. I was at a small gathering of former colleagues on Saturday - 17 of us, all socially distanced, double vaxxed &amp; boosted. Of the 17, so far 14 have tested positive for COVID. I have not, yet.
1522368923924111362	@Think2Speak1 @DrEricDing @DrWilliamKu The thousands hospitalized for COVID care, as do all of their loved ones. As do all intelligent people, as any one of us could be those I've just mentioned at any time, because the current approach is permanent pandemic, forever. #COVID19 #florida #FlaPol
1463518527537692675	just saw that lisa tested positive for covid... i hope she recovers fast :)
1457756535640231938	Anyone that was at https://t.co/cADAYaMZ8j and has tested positive for Covid please let the community know so those that were with you can get tested. Those that came into contact with these individuals I suggest you get tested again.
1522775733508190208	@SabrinaHsiang I work for a school system. We were vaxxed and stayed masked for months. Social distancing, washing hands, avoiding large indoor gatherings, and weekly voluntary testing. I am scheduled to get my second booster in about 10 days. I've never tested positive for covid.
1343493147670634496	@BorisJohnson you alright my guy. ,Had the vaccine last monday, tested positive this monday. Something tells me it dont work either that or you gave me Covid!
1485967077886337026	can’t win. it’s 8am y’all have diagnosed me with a cold otp when my colon is compromised and i can barely shit something solid but yk ig we can wait 7 days it’s not like any of this is life threatening i suppose wouldn’t want any healthcare professionals catching the flu/covid
1506670525623541763	Starting to think pretty much everyone at FE caught Covid. I found out today I was in very close contact with someone who just tested positive. So I more then likely have it too.I think mandatory testing before any con should be a thing tbh, not just proof of vaxx.

1320930515025707009	I had Covid-19. I tested positive for the antibodies shortly thereafter. A month later I tested again... antibodies were gone.This means 2 things:1. A vaccine will not work.2. Remain vigilant even after getting it.This also explains the cases where people got reinfected.
1339273933066014721	@mollymcnearney My wife, Jacki, an RN at a local hospital, worked the covid unit the 1st 3 months. Still at hospital on med/surg. Her getting the vaccine is days away and guess what...she tested positive this morning.
1378021376276107265	@mtgreenee If you’re so confident, there are plenty of states that have dropped their mask mandate where you could probably walk in to the hospital and visit COVID patients. Let’s see it. Oh and I assume you’re too healthy to even carry and transmit to others, right?
1468535534809239552	I’m a care assistant, I worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic, often doing 14 hour shifts and putting myself forward for more shifts when other staff had tested positive. This #Covid19 news regarding Number 10 Downing Street is beyond appalling. #BorisOut
1479292958239125510	@redpriestown @CountyofLA @lapublichealth Just found out a woman in my husband's office tested positive for CoVid yesterday...She is fully vaxxed and always wears a mask....This is not what was promoted when the vaccines were approved...and now the boosters are being promoted and people get one and STILL can get Co-vid.
1441789730924998656	"@RNGStreams Congrats! Losing weight is always a challenge, that's great! I definitely DO NOT recommend my latest ""crash diet"" of getting hospitalized with covid 😬But I did lose 20 lbs over 3 weeks and my man lost 32 in the same timeframe. Crazy!"

1344434044428288000	I tested positive for COVID-19 but after 21 days was retested and am now negative. I plan to get the vaccine when it’s available. Now tell me why I would still need to wear a mask?
1553187267069374464	@1_critique @JReinerMD I mean I guess we shouldn't wear masks anymore when we're treating COVID patients in the hospital.
1378322936424194050	@WholeFoods @amazon @AmazonHelp yesterday morning I ordered food from the amazon app for delivery, as we have some in the house that tested positive for Covid. After waiting on the food all day at 10:30 PM you guys send me a message say we cancelled your order.
1506388253729255424	Tested positive for covid and my entire life came crashing down on me last night. I don’t want to elaborate but I’ll just say I had to sleep on my living room floor with my lungs just not getting enough air and I also fucked up my back and shoulder when I fell at work yesterday
1438172330241388547	@dremilyportermd This is a tsunami of stupid, your definitely right. Still i'm not sure why people and providers (as opposed to public health professionals) need with covid tests.Feel sick? Stay home.Can't breathe or otherwise need hospital care? Go to hospital.In all events? Wear a mask.
1440491812267851779	@kevinwordswort1 @Chicago1Ray I know of a young boy who was hospitalized and put on remdesivir. He was drowning because Covid plus remdesivir were causing fluid in the lungs. A family member secretly gave him ivermectin and he’s now home - still on oxygen for now because of the treatment but home.
1418695497603239938	@ReaganWorld Right now, it's virtually only unvaccinated people seriously ill with Covid, hospitalized, and dying from Covid.  Since those are mostly Republicans, I'll leave it with you as to whether you want to continue to perpetuate your Covid denials.

One lady was active, never drank or smoked and had no medical problems except minor arthritis. This seems so precarious

1416191590465482761	@yesnicksearcy I was in a house for 3 days with 15 people. One couple tested positive for Covid the day we left. Several of us are not vaccinated. Nobody got Covid. Just saying.
1616885703849435136	@SorinBarbara @CollinRugg @elonmusk I had COVID. I, like 95% of unvaccinated COVID infectees, didn’t have to go to the hospital. But then, I took Ivermectin tablets (the human version) and was 100% improved after 48 hours.
1378053150410690566	Bruh if I test positive for COVID ima snap
1436230906080071683	@PeterHotez I have been preaching to the Natural Immunity crowd too. The other one I am seeing is that natural immunity is better than vaccine in preventing infection! You already had Covid once, how is that better? In addition, you are more likely to be hospitalized or die vs. vaccination!
1452718708087050253	@TheLaurenChen I’m not arguing for passports or masks but I’m immunocompromised. I will tell you - I was severely sick from covid. Had to go to the hospital. Im young and fit. The flu, which I’ve had many times, would be a day or two in bed. It’s an entirely different level of risk.

The figures should be a lot higher.

1445692791330246660	I watched an episode of Law and Order yesterday. It was about corona virus. Brisco was about to interview a patient in the hospital and he said shouldn't we be wearing a mask or something. It had killed 12 in NY.
1441481427858563072	This past Tuesday, I tested positive for COVID (suspected Delta variant). We write about it, but wow, you truly do not know isolation until you experience it. There’s no rule book either when you’re a student or running a paper.

1382779346474110982	@polisands @alefeusch @DJSlayerRelic @AsthmaCoach @AP You don't have to get it, but I'm more than positive that jobs, businesses especially if you want to work, schools &amp; even travelling is going to require you to vaccinated against COVID. Or having a negative COVID test. Doesn't matter if you have antibodies.
1377820632457560066	My 14 year old tested positive for Covid today. The only time he leaves the house is to go to school. 5th period music tech teacher marked him absent because he fell asleep in his quarantined room. Thankfully,his only current symptoms are a headache and lethargy. 🤷‍♀️whatever
1478400509769920515	"@olray522 @mewpocalypse @Gj91734428 @TheRealBobrek @Kananga_Balloon @BretWeinstein Also I never claimed it ""wasn't"" covid I'm sure alot of people who was really fearful of covid ran to the hospital at slightest symptom. What I'm saying is that the number of ACTUAL covid cases and deaths are inflated. So you know how covid deaths are counted? https://t.co/YUkoqbcnBT"
1612017748363575296	@TheGumFairy With my big sis, she just tested positive for f*****g COVID. So she has had to miss going to the hospital for the results of her CT scan😢👎
1447146692797779972	hey!important life/shop update time!two members of my family (who live in the same household as me) have tested positive for COVID. Despite the dumb uk guidelines, i’m staying at home as much as i can! This means i will be closing my shop until i feel comfortable with my own *
1330569804382605313	Here's how it works: If I have no symptoms, but test positive, I am counted as a #covidcase  If I take the vaccine and only get mildly sick from the #COVIDー19 , I'm considered in that 94.5% success rate.  Data rules
1473106999059660800	@NgomaNqo @BitaScicomm Yeah 90% in ICU were unvaccinated, that was a complete lie, I don't know but why are there so many lies surrounding the covid narrative from government and media, I'm not anti Vax but very skeptical
1427812576637988865	@guardian I love how the media always has an agenda, “who fought mask mandates” test positive. What the head line should say, another vaccinated person gets covid, do these  vaccines really work?
1483540452955820032	Read this if you think getting infected with COVID in Victoria is a good idea at the moment: My nightmare in hospital as COVID stressed the system https://t.co/rP9MN1tFFsNo criticism of the health care staff who are doing all they can in a terribly stressed system. We all ...
1418445126788132864	@kimura_oss @LBC This is why I support vaccine passports and making those who refuse the vaccine pay for their covid treatment in hospital.
1463992816564989956	My wife's stepmother was going to join us for Thanksgiving. She wasn't feeling well. Took a rapid Covid test. She tested positive.Wishing her well. She is 76, but still active and in good health.
1372907102876884995	@Porotuko @ZeeJayson @JoshShowers @WSBT @MaxLewisTV i take that back, i did miss 2 weeks of work, took personal time to be with my kid in the ICU and saw first hand what covid can do to people, kids and adults. its selfish to only care about yourself and to think your actions dont have an effect on others
1375161028590202881	@geoffstack01 @JKPreachersgirl Rex, last June, I tested positive for antibodies after having been asymptomatic with Covid. Covid did nothing to me as far as I know but this vaccine has.
1504955203296055298	@JLAINEA77 @NathanMackBrown I hear you. Also a vaxxed boosted elementary art teacher. Unfortunately I tested covid positive this week. At least I was still wearing a mask so  hoping none of my kids got it. So far mild symptoms...headache and tired.
1402825810101293057	Lived this and seen this.  Our medical system solves 1 issue creates 10 more.  So covid19 vaccine might keep u safe.  Watch the effects in the next decade Doctors blindly prescribe to stop symptoms in all cases Ppl end up in ER 10 times worse.4 times I was given meds almost died https://t.co/OACvoAF3gA
1384193843755589641	"@skysira @BryanMyrick @jtwilcox111 LOL!  ""In 2020, politics trumped science.""  Well, Trump ignored science and he got treated to a weekend in the hospital and then got out and spread his virus far and wide.  I think COVID trumped politics and followed science which said doing nothing would cause it to spread."
1504235926645469188	@loscharlos 3 Omega 3’s, Nattokinase &amp; Serrapeptase help to break up clots &amp; will help but maybe a Prescription for Xarelto would help but most Doctors don’t know how to deal w/Long COVID. I was in the hospital w/COVID B4 the Vaccines came—gave me 2 jabs/day of an anti-coagulant.
1511307124416131075	@Fenlandbumpkin @TzuSays @LozzaFox Wrong! My neighbour is a nurse who was moved from cardio to covid with zero experience of how to fit respiratory equipment. Usually treating people in icu recovering from heart ops. Icus were full of covid patients. People refusing the vaccine were part of the problem
1384903868132339713	Things are crazy in India. This thread / report from @FT suggests ~17,000 deaths a DAY in India right now due #COVID19. I know anecdotally that lots of people are not getting tested if one person in their family tested positive already.  So, assume 5x more cases (~1M / day).
1381675209456037898	i’m confused what are the regulations like in the uk? im excited about the meetup (assuming none of them have covid or tested positive for it) but when meeting fans no one has there mask on and idk just seems a tad reckless. maybe i’m just paranoid? but it’s better to be safe imo
1474254031744872461	i fr had covid and didn’t even realize it/test positive until the third pcr test and i was dealing with finals and i was on my period all at once i am invincible and will (unfortunately) never die a girl is a gun
1473001111690919936	@magnumCJ @MissMarie_84 I am skeptical of reporting as well; I saw a number of cases where people passed away from one thing such as a car accident but were tested posthumous and were positive so it was counted as a COVID death
1396925687689265152	i just got tested for covid cuz im mad sick do yall think im gonna be positive 😩
1377809071617810442	@DaDeeva4Life @Pastor__West I just got over Covid Pneumonia I Thank GOD so much to be here to even tell you about it I spent 2 weeks in ICU and one week on a regular floor using oxygen, came home with oxygen for 2 weeks im  still healing at a GODSPEED  people protect yourself and others, Its real REAL
1375801688372695042	@annabkrr No. In a small percentage of people they can still get and spread the virus. My doctor advised that it appears to be preventing covid deaths. If you do get it after vaccination you most likely will not be hospitalized. Will still wear one during flu season. Good luck to Nana!💕
1379889067525988354	@ck_eternity_ @NiacinIsHealth I believe as a #longcovid patient that NA will be found to be very helpful. But it’s not pleasant to get a hypotensive migraine or gout...The migraine sent me to the ER. It helps me so much I’m still taking it, but hasn’t been fun to be a guinea pig. We need better guidelines
1377758158576320519	@theserfstv I doubt, 3/4 of covid patients in hospital are just fat people and elders that do not exercise
1514430311341432837	🥴 I tested positive for COVID this morning. I’m staying at Bs house, quarantining in his room. The worst part of all of this is that he’s literally downstairs and I can’t spend time with him.
1377752628462030850	@CassyWearsHeels I’ll predict that Covid case will increase and it will be from the vaccinated, just like the 200+ in Washington who test positive after receiving both shots.
1481252274072858626	The news is that  #ArjunKapoor and #MalaikaArora has broken up. Well i always had a doubt when both of them separately tested positive for covid.
1613971774625955840	@MarioNawfal I got the 1st and 2nd dose Sinovac and nothing happened. When I got the 1st dose, totally 3rd dose, Bill Gates vaccination (BionTech) and I got tested COVID-19 positive about 1.5 or 2 weeks.
1342266281941225474	@MeghanMcCain As a urgent care nurse- I am terrified. We cannot get a vaccine. We are true front line. We see everyone before they end up in the Er/icu. My company is 1st in COVID testing in the US. No vaccines for us.

1381939062349647872	Tested negative for covid Positive for sever sinus infectionEither way I’m sucking it up and getting on that damn plane to Hawaii tomorrow!
1459568452864204811	@MikeHolden42 In theory it’s fine, I suppose if you tripped and fell you’d need help either to get home or to hospital which puts others at risk. If I catch COVID I’ll be in the same boat.
1504063437323730947	"@Splodge_Humbug @ellymelly I loved it when the head of ICU at Royal Perth left McGowan out to dry by admitting almost all the cases in ICU reported as ""covid"" were all in there for non covid related reasons.... suddenly McGowan reduces the number the next day.  Even Jesus took 3 days to rise from the dead."
1450451768245198852	My Nan is going into hospital. My mum is currently in isolation as she has covid. Please send some love my way right now I’m so scared. Love my Nan so so much, my heart just aches with worry for her
1374730708959248389	@UKCovid19Stats With most of the vulnerable now had their first dose of vaccine surely it’s time for the government to rethink how they count deaths as I’m sure the odds of an 80 plus person dying within 28 days of a positive covid test is quite high even though it clearly won’t be covid.
1466600936537608196	You have no idea how my pain when I always thought that I probably the reason why my atuk get covid (wallahualam) bcs I went back a week before a week before he was diagnosed with covid. You have no idea the guilt that I feel up to this moment.

1378043202083639297	@ClaireZambuni @CompaniesHouse @GOVUK @BBCNews @DailyMailUK Keep me posted s as me I’ll let you know where we get to. Anna’s day 8 is tomorrow and her return flight to Madrid (where she lives and works) is on Tuesday. To cap it all, we’ve already had to change her flight as someone tested positive for Covid on her flight to U.K.
1380516598700597250	I got Covid in July and ended up in the ER — I was in so much pain every time I breathed, I couldn’t catch my breath. I now have active asthma, but I’ve built back my lung capacity and can ride bikes faster than ever. Now, here’s to lasting immunity and no more ER visits 🤞🏻🙏🏻🤞🏻 https://t.co/xJbX09rJ4z
1430695599423164422	@donwinslow I never went to the hospital when I had covid anyways, they probably would have  murdered me and in retrospect the ventilators they put people on did more harm than good.
1502659853914886145	@MacInto07691026 @Dave99202115 @CBCManitoba his response was yes . my next response to him is well if masks are 100% effective like the nurses said then how did you get covid at least 2 times while in the hospital in the over 4 months you were there 🤔
1431164720409612291	I took an antibody test for a well known covid monitoring  app and it came back positive and it doesn't say if it's from the vaccine or from a past infection and now naturally I'm freaking out.
1425324282536546307	@Syzlak_ @Tupac_Katari123 @blakeyboy06 @chelsea_hetho I suggest if his wife is in hospital with COVID then he should have been home isolating.
1383889851687178242	How many covid patients are in hospital now? Meantime, I always wear a mask in hospital and I have been in and out of them many times during the crisis. I don't like rude, patronising or silly though. Hasta la vista.
1483840412775288835	@ChilledChaos Me after being diagnosed with Covid today
1376847172851920896	@AutSciPerson THANK YOU.I also got the vaccine last week as i’m VERY high risk for death from covid due to other physical issues, but i also have suffered so much in hospital and in care for physical issues due to my not being truly heard or even being able to explain my pain etc
1385300766915796994	@Napsterrific custodian at my wife's school, who already had a presumptive positive that turned out not to be COVID back in early March after he declined vax, just tested positive.  still didn't get vaccinated.
1592592245269860352	@GFarooqi Get well soon…. I listen you also tested positive of Covid
1477873980908486659	@awong37 @maureen_oesch @deonandan @bruce_arthur I agree with you but the other night* Dr. Fauci mentioned that many would go to the hospital for primarily something else (like broken leg) but tested + for COVID-19, so that statistic would just go under Covid.*or was it on social media instead of TV?
1611200415873511424	@scrowder I’ve had a sinus thing since the beginning of November. It’s flared up 3 times, the last time I tested positive for influenza. All 3 times negative for Covid.
1490823333906194434	@SenatorCardin I'm calling BS Senator.Majority of people hospitalized with COVID are fully vaccinated.Follow the science (not Fauci) and repeal all mandates.@WHCOVIDResponse @ChrisVanHollen
1484236664167747588	CVS are out of tests where I live but I’m 99% sure I got Covid. Someone very close to me tested positive and now I am super sick
1376652407359348740	https://t.co/QUd6erAhvBNot exactly surprised. My wife had covid, and tested positive. I developed mild symptoms and I was negative. I either had cross T-Cell immunity, or a false negative. You can't set arbitrary test targets and expect quality results!
1437479565287374858	@dflat57 @lilycatsmeow @GigiGraciette She spent 2 weeks in the hospital as her body tried to fight covid. If she didn't have that many more days, then why did it take 2 weeks for her body to give up? I'm not sad about any of this, just offering perspective to your tweet.
1414606953557413889	Health Update:Will remain in the hospital for 1-2 weeks. Basically COVID attacked my lungs really hard and they are way too inflated, causing me to have trouble breathing. Since I will have free time, any recommendations of anime/movies/shows to watch?
1359187478998040582	@AaronMeyers If you’re not allowed to get the vaccine, ask the dental staff for an N95 mask, wear some form of eye protection and you’ll be fine. I worked in the ER for nearly a year before getting vaccinated and never got Covid, thanks to PPE &amp; proper sanitizing.
1472006333901815812	@FortressHidden They aren’t ‘off sick’. They are self isolating after testing positive for Covid. They may be receiving ‘sick pay’ but we have no idea how many are actually capable of working. I suspect most could and if regulations are changed to negative LFT test then they could do their job
1405572854905778184	@PornPanic @qbwarmdays @ZubyMusic Also, my guy, the overwhelming majority (78%) of people hospitalized for “covid” were either overweight or obese. That’s a problem, not healthy individuals who refuse a vaccine. Again, no offense, but they prey upon you mentally because they know the majority of you are weak
1529515961912594433	@SpookySarahSays What the hell is wrong with you?! If you have a condition that has been diagnosed, then I will understand. But ur comment is coming from a hijacked place. Covid has a 99.9% survival rate--STILL. If you're afraid of those odds, that's a mental health crisis; NOT a Covid crisis!
1382374871678607363	@kurteichenwald If that were true, we'd be seeing an uptick in these incredibly rare blood clot problems among people who hadn't recently been vaccinated and who didn't test positive for COVID, which is not a thing I've heard.
1431245428633260040	Myself (vaccinated and proud wearer of the mask) and the 2 yr/o have now tested positive for COVID.  My oldest either contracted it at church or school in spite of wearing her mask.  And it occurs to me:1/Start

1419469369093021704	@drsajumathew @PamelaBrownCNN I watched an interview with a MAGA unvaccinated COVID patient IN THE HOSPITAL. He said he has no regrets for not getting vaccinated.

1480196808462770180	Seeing that NHS staff who refuse to get the Covid vaccine are wearing a purple ribbon of solidarity against it being a requirement of employment.Can I just check if, gods forbid, I have to end up in hospital, I can refuse to be treated by someone wearing said ribbon?

1537476082718343169	@TeatheShiba @Flair_Zero I feel this, back at the beginning of the pandemic(and often still now) many hospital employees were told they were not allowed to call out for COVID. Many symptomatic nurses for example had to test positive before being allowed off, which at the time often took more than a week.

1527783165032554499	Amplifying this because I tested positive for Covid earlier this week and it was a very rough couple of days. Took Paxlovid and felt much better within 36 hrs. And it’s free too!

1549471292860125184	I tested positive for Covid today. I’ve been really sick. I’m praying for a speedy recovery ❤️‍🩹
1449088719068217347	"@OzraeliAvi Why has every single person I know that's ""taken the jab"" tested positive for covid after being fully vaccinated? Why aren't those living on government funds required? I mean, they also go to public places and shop at grocery stores....."
1458124345667047429	@Freakoutery Third thing missing: rate of hospitalization.  I don't think most people care about getting covid if their experience is essentially a bad flu, from which they recover and suffer no long term effects.  People care about dying or ending up in the hospital.
1382195643213512706	RIP the patient with COVID I admitted two weeks ago. She was diagnosed 5 days earlier yet needed nasal cannula but could talk your ear off. Despite all interventions she was vented a week later. She was taken off life support later despite being pcr neg. cytokine storm is real.
1407064320903634944	So……I tested positive for COVID…..I mean all I feel  is a cough and just can’t smell or taste but other then that I’m good
1380584578574741504	@GingerGano No some of us like me can't take a Covid shot I can't even take the flu shot it puts me into the hospital every time I have done it so the Covid shot would likely kill me I will not take that risk. it is too high of a risk for me I am Allergic to flu shots.
1506699666292985864	Agreed. I managed to avoid covid for 2 years but tested positive last week. 4 of my team of 9 at work also have tested positive but we have all been working from home for the last 2 years so we have all caught it from different sources.
1552622220236787712	@sophielouisecc When I nearly died of mumps 3 years ago every single doctor and nurse who looked after me over my 3 day stay in hospital was a foreign national. They were lovely, kind and fully attentive. I owe them my life. As does Boris Johnson after his Covid recovery. God bless immigration.
1409965598176595973	@randymco @soapmaker10 @RandPaul You hear about the NC State baseball team they just got kicked out of the CWS?  Four of them that were vaccinated tested positive for covid but nobody else.  Remind me again which group are incubators?
1546184485271613440	damn well I tested positive for covid 🤠 you hate to see it
1506882801613910016	I cried two times when #Yoongi was diagnosed right after he came back 4rm LA &amp; now #Hobi diagnosed b4 going LV.I know he'll be fine b4 Grammys but still🥺I had COVID twice,but I never felt this much lost tbh 1st COVID was very difficult for me.2 was bearable.#Hoseok 💜 https://t.co/6BPrvLRzMr
1376023001062313984	We follow all the regs. Maybe we'll test positive anyway but I'll know I did everything possible..Someone doesn't believe in gravity - the apple will STILL fall..people ignore COVID regs -  someone will STILL get sickScience is reliable that way. Huh. @Travisdhanraj
1430352977232072708	@Russe1TheTeapot @thought19507934 @aliclayks @RealSteveH27 @nerdypowerliftr @markgromo @bdickison12 @JoriEpstein I actually had covid in June. Was in the hospital for a week getting poked all week for labs. I’m certainly not scared. Had 3 blood clots in my lung almost put on a vent. So again I’ll ask, does the vaccine work? No one has answered me yet which is why I’m going in “circles”.
1476048395278204931	@Acyn I got your understanding right here, pal.Your behavior &amp; others like you who refuse to get vaccinated:are helping to spread COVID;are showing up in hospitals, 90% of those hospitalized for COVID ARE UNVACCINATED;are exhausting health care workers.https://t.co/Z95Rn3tLQ3
1380952395946004489	@HerExcell @thevivafrei So you are claiming there is NO relationship between COVID cases and COVID hospitalizations. People have to get sick with COVID before going to the hospital to get treated for COVID.This makes sense to me, maybe I am missing something.
1387567990946766854	@OBusybody I’ve yet to have a college student in the ER that suffered from severe Covid S/S, but it’s far too many to count that I’ve had from drug/ETOH abuse. Colleges turn a blind eye to substance abuse. Take it from someone that sees this first hand.
1481213750879612928	so i tested positive for covid
1477169742536445955	@cgately21 @WDWNT I literally tested positive today. Had a fever for 2 days. Little cough now is all that's left. My sis-in-law, nurse, tested me today and I'm positive. If this is what covid is now, it's not worth reporting about anymore. Vaccines and boosters are pointless now with this variant
1481085350651047937	3 months exactly to the day I was diagnosed with Covid the first time, I now have the Omicron. Woohooo I should be a lab Guinea pig at this point
1483797327114485766	I'm still in so much pain. Waiting for my pain meds. And oh yeah I tested positive for covid. I can't believe its still only January.
1606617020648284162	@CounsellingSam After carefully  avoiding covid for almost three years I got careless Christmas shopping and tested positive. I will now be spending Christmas in our loft conversion hoping the family will leave some food outside the door. Wear a mask and avoid crowds I wish I had.
1478919897853816833	I tested positive for #Covid on April 29, 2021. My symptoms in chronological order:1. Shaking Chills2. Fever3. Coughing mucus4. Shortness of breath5. Body Aches6. Loss of appetite 7.  Weight loss*It took me 60 days for a full recovery and I am now fully #vaccinated
1481292438899724293	@DocMCohen If he's in I ICU with COVID and unvacksed..he will be in the MINORITY demo..but since COVID cases make up roughly 20% of the ICU  numbers..He will.also be in the MINORITY of unvacksed in ICU that make up the 80% remainder that are not COVID related if that is his case https://t.co/mQsYM5Y7n6
1390455708307525633	@cheryl_kernot @geoffrey_payne I don't understand how COVID cases in HQ are going up even though all passengers are supposed to have negative test result prior to travel???I also don't understand how Morrison can deny COVID positive Australians a trip home &amp; leave them to die in India - it's barbaric🐝
1375928659136102403	@polly_titian @doctor_oxford I'm so sorry for your loss. My 85yo mum in a care home in Nth Wales, clear for 10 months then COVID crept in via 2 carers in January! 4 residents tested positive, sadly mum was the only 1 who couldn't fight it and passed away after 5 days. 💔
1512204652481196081	@visionofviii I lost my job two weeks ago and last week tested positive for covid..So this money will definitely help a lot. $Devil1310
1476382251751460868	@America1Scotty That happened last Christmas season. My wife tested positive and did not have Covid. Her doctor said almost all her results were positive for a ten day period.
1373826629848465408	@FleurDeLeeArt @cbouzy As terrible as the situation is, Brazil’s President doesn’t believe COVID is a potential killer, after he was diagnosed with it. He doesn’t want anyone’s help &amp; if he were to receive any aid I believe it would go to waste or be misused.
1429271172835778563	@Toure My husband had COVID over Christmas. He was not at high risk for complications. He spent 8 days in the hospital, 3 months on oxygen at home, is on meds for COVID anxiety and still does not have full lung capacity. IT’S NOT THE F**KING FLU.
1362834646652751873	CDC's own report claimed that 94% of patients hospitalized are  those w/underlying med conditions catching Covid while only 6% of patients were Covid only.I believe that's a contributing factor why death toll is so high in Ca and country.All high risk ppl need vaccine priority!
1544977436714188801	@_ashawndabney Me and my husband. He’s got some long Covid-like chronic fatigue since Jan 22. He’d never had Covid nor tested positive for it!!
1380894271629320200	in these covid times even back when the virus was a mystery and spreading and killing like crazy, I would've ended up in a psych ward if my loved one were dying and they didn't let me in the hospital room in fear i'd get infected bitch move before I go otto delaney on your ass
1392508027471806468	So my whole household except for me tested positive for covid ... 😳
1384560450625576960	@HobbesMatraca @FrontiersIn Cyproheptadine is also a sigma-1 agonist, and it may counteract some effects of excessive serotonin release from platelets (which may be particularly relevant in ICU patients). I have not seen it studied in outpatients with COVID19.
1553299393436176385	@LordDeeDah I don’t get this either ! One guy was telling me how covid is a myth and never been isolated , then the following week on the what’s app group says sorry can’t be this weekend as I am in hospital with covid and seriously sick. So sick he found the time to what’s app everyone 🤣
1519594730564296704	@Sonnet_Lumiere @GMB @BWallaceMP Most of our death toll came from other deaths not covid! I know three people that had covid put on their death certificate but died of cancer but happened to get covid in hospital in their end of life care
1602341962324930563	@byzosgal @JReinerMD Apparently an overdose from Fentanyl does. I'm not even kidding. A 32 year old man's death was marked as a covid death, only because he had tested positive within 28 days of his overdose.
1437464332535803905	@mtgreenee “When do we help people overcome the highest risk factor for being hospitalized &amp; dying from covid?”I don’t know? I got it!!GET VACCINATED!!! https://t.co/e68G1okBzF

1445503012584103938	@LexicSyd @KUTV2News It is sad. But then again.. I’m actually seeing it up close. How about you? Do you truly grasp the concept of just how sad this is? When is the last time you were in one of these hospitals? One of these Covid floors? How about in the ICU?
1484225370194808832	Sunday they both tested positive for COVID. When I got to their house on Sunday my 3 siblings were already there, none wearing a mask. I donned my top rated N95 mask and went in the house. My unvaxxed sibs are staying around the clock to care for them. ALL 4 now with COVID.3/
1486048990323949577	well it was bc of covid; i got tested positive today 💀
1393179040568201221	@CNN I beg to differ. Not so fast CDC. New York Yankees say 8 vaccinated members tested positive for Covid-19. Here's how that could happen https://t.co/R9W0QoGrXX
1472929950898409475	@Martyupnorth_ Early treatment has been one of the biggest mistakes of this pandemic. Sit at home lay on couch til covid becomes pneumonia. Then come to hospital and go on ventilator to die. How many lives could have been saved I wonder.
1373846055310229504	I don’t know anyone, of any age whose died of CovidI only know one person , a girl in her mid 20s, who tested positive. But no one else in her household, who she never distanced from, tested positive. So it was most likely a false positive
1376874180310880260	The cast and the crew are ok!!! His test was positive from 25 or 26 March when I find out that someone is with covid.It's the same situation when Elcin had covid and just Elcin was affected not the cast or crew. 🙏So, after that they had tests for their safety. #SenCalKapimi https://t.co/HCQjMlhnKs
1416383647557558278	@sajidjavid And you've now tested positive for covid. Oh my goodness - what cost a photo opportunity?
1456122933055823873	@Lalosaaan @ArrowheadLoud @LudPLud @TheHerd @BillSimmons I read 4100 people who were fully vaxxed were either hospitalized or died. 175 died and were asymptotic- they died from something else not COVID.
1490584707305598976	@MichaelPSenger If you are tested positive for the novel coronavirus in the event of participating in a major sports meeting.Certain measures should be taken for treatment or isolation.If he is allowed to participate in the Winter Olympics, it will be bad for everyone.i hope you understand.
1424745523941187588	"21 kids hospitalized w/Covid. 6 in the ICU. This is just Northeast Florida. ""Kids can't get it. It's never a problem for kids. It's not a problem that kids under 12 can't get vaxxed yet. Why should I wear a mask? Fuck those kids; they are probably fat."""
1480894852174909444	@lapsedoldsoak When I had it in February I felt fine within a few days but had to be tested prior to an operation a fortnight later. Unfortunately I was positive and when I called the Covid 'helpline' was told it can stay in your system for 90 days. The op was cancelled.
1462449266694180866	I just found out that Pup is going to have a different P.A. in her transport service for school for the next week, cos her regular one has tested positive for Covid....
1475498138131742725	I can finally say I personally know people who tested positive for Covid!  The family experienced cold like symptoms. The partner who is vaxxed was the most ill. (Realized that correlation isn’t causation). Would they have known without the RATS?
1420046791249211395	I do not be feeling sorry for people that go to these super spreader events &amp; test positive for Covid

1446625992223576066	@gnmtsc @dilawar_karim @adriandix Nope I have been here... under going the same situation as everyone else. It doesn't change the fact the COVID is highly recoverable, and that MOST people who get it, have flu like symptoms, isolate at home and recover. A very small percentage end up in the ICU.
1453286532471828490	Had another negative #Covid test (which is good because what I do have is a stinking cold).Just thought, much as it's normal in medicine as to use the term 'positive' to mean someone does have a virus, to the ordinary person a positive result means a good result.
1479526900565528578	Got a hospital report today for a patient who told me on the phone Monday he’s not going to the hospital for shortness of breath because COVID isn’t real. His lab results and chest Xray suggest that COVID very much is an infection he currently has.
1436092965923999746	@BlancaCamachoNY @JReedCooley @LEOwhlls Or maybe like do I find prisoners because many of the people there were taken from their homes and forced into there in handcuffs because they tested positive for covid. https://t.co/owLcvN407K

1441058719010365440	I’m def not highly knowledgeable about the Covid protocol. But can someone explain to me why u can be exposed to a positive person. Quarantine 5 days instead of 7 bc u took a test on day 2 that was negative? Can’t u still get it on day 3-5? What happened to 14 day quarantine?
1377292800467771393	@teachaged 10 people I know had their 2nd shot, only 1 had more than a sore arm as side effect. Felt generally crappy but back to normal the next day. Can’t get my 1st vac til mid April. Was in the hospital (11 days)with Covid. Docs say wait 90 days before I can get it🙄
1478429843234693121	I tested positive for Covid so if you’ve been in contact with me these past two weeks pls get tested. Also ngl it’s really really kicking my ass😪. This sickness is no joke hm.
1391446574593572868	@ambikasat @ambikasat I don’t think that All identified Covid cases would need to be hospitalized. You may wish to research and check this out.
1524213003603693568	@warrenlayberry @GlobalBC Again, you're trying to score some points cause you think im the character you built in your head. They're literally telling you if someone dies in a car accident but tested positive they're counted as a covid death. Im telling you they're not, because they're not.

1443929196036694020	@lutl88 @fitterhappierAJ I think once again they have ignored long covid in trials and it seems this drug will not be available to us without the fabled positive test. Hospitalization is not a biomarker. I am tired of the way the US media laps up pharma press releases as gospel.
1446513497026748416	Been quiet last week or so as tested positive again but it’s hit me hard! Covid is real and even if just a heavy flu, it’s rough. Happy to say except the smell, I am back to normal. Missed you all #RecoveryPosse
1436288102885117979	@AndrewG67388150 @JuliaHB1 Just because the number is too small to appear in the graph, 80 children have died with covid in the UK. Increasing numbers are admitted in hospital. But I guess they don't matter.

1371889386850283523	@AsenathMagic The man was fit strong healthy all his life no previous health conditions then takes the vaccine! Wake up! If he had positive COVID test u would say the deadly virus killed him no questions asked but different view when it’s the vaccine, blows my mind 🐑💉

1383572737709334529	Not being able to connect with family more than twice a week is tough for my mum, who was always big on keeping connected to family and neighbours. Covid was bad enough. Covid+being in hospital is terrible. Being able to host video calls for my mum and take care of her is huge.
1484970439227195393	NOTICE: It seems I have tested positive for covid. I feel fine but am staying home for now. IF you had close contact with me, please get tested. My only symptoms were a mild cold. If you dont see me at Cameron Tourny next week, now you know why.
1559343362624323584	@sonic0357 @readerofthetime @AndyKindler She hasn’t tested positive, absolutely does not mean she hasn’t had COVID. I am “presumed” to have had COVID, twice, based on symptoms &amp; other household members testing positive, but I never tested positive. All I felt was tired, with slight neck pain &amp; headaches.
1371922324958613512	@Et_toi_Thomas @KymC1019 @Wallis4America I'll take my chances on the vaccine because the research says no one has died or been hospitalized once vaccinated. Getting Covid without being vaccinated means a strong chance of hospitalization and perhaps death. The vaccine also means I protect others.
1381986452460855309	@angrybklynmom @angie_rasmussen I think she's saying that if you are hospitalized for Covid you have a 1 in 5 chance of developing a blood clot.

1428475080674140165	Sure, #FreeAustralia . Now tell me, when you've got two 30 year olds who need lifesaving treatment and no beds in the ER due to covid cases (and sick medical staff), would you like to choose who lives and who dies because you couldn't be bothered to wear a mask and stay home?
1542837305366519808	@IcyBB2006 Aww I’m the same! I didn’t test positive until day 3 of knowing it must be Covid! Day 5 for me now, never felt so ill!

1448775364071677957	On @joerogan, @drsanjaygupta said that one of the reasons that there is people who are hospitalized or die from covid after vaccination is because of pre existing conditions and immune compromised....so now that matters huh? I feel like I'm living in the Truman Show

1474823187867344898	@ScouseSocialism @Saffiya_Khan1 @OwenJones84 That’s not true, that’s what the bad faith merchants say, I happen to know about at least five people whose cancer care has continued as normal during the pandemic, including one person’s mum who had a stroke during the second lockdown and caught covid in hospital and nearly died
1473801548392284168	Well looks like I'm home until at least next Wednesday due to close contact with someone who tested positive for covid at work Monday.😔😔
1473714252062023690	@GammonUncle Most people in ICU with covid are unvaccinated, but yeh I’m the moron…
1546296680647106560	Well... I had a good run....My first positive Covid test...Vaxxed and boosted...I know I will survive!A 2 year run!..not bad!
1469090793872834574	@DrEricDing Inovio’s vaccines demonstrated long-term memory T-cells in NHPs for MERS &amp; SARS-CoV2. I’m in P2 trial for INO-4800 &amp; been COVID-free 10 months post dose 2, despite exposure to 2 diagnosed household cases &amp; teaching 3 months in Michigan. Try something new that may work better?
1465519492939673602	@AndBrazen My grandkids were tested, that's how I learned of RSV. Unfortunately we've got a plethora of infectious diseases that are currently similar to covid and other respiratory infections,  and it is stressful until you find out. Stay positive, but stay safe.
1543281616633548800	Does anyone else question people calling this period of time ‘post-pandemic’? I mean, I finally tested negative for COVID yesterday after more than 10 days positive. Call me silly, but this feels very much ‘pandemic’.
1356527118990114822	@dadlanicar @raarts @cenkuygur But he is trying to plant that seed in our heads. I'm squashing it. I was ill with covid, and tested positive for antibodies 9 months ago. At the appropriate time according to the protocol, I'll get my vaccine.
1387242457922891783	Still fighting Covid! I am happy I listened to my body and came to the hospital. It’s been over a week now but I am getting all the help I need to kick this ugliness to the curb!
1418981606556061702	@RealCandaceO My local trauma center just told me they can’t test for delta variant just covid and any new positive is deemed delta by proxy despite not being able to test for it. You could just have last years version. All smoke and mirrors.
1374418681975906309	One more reason to get the #CovidVaccine - A doughnut. - Vaccines are free- Vaccines prevent severe disease and slow the spread- Vaccines provide the best pathway back to normalI tested positive for #COVID19 in Dec 2020 &amp; I still feel long-term symptoms. GET THE VACCINE!

1373660137450258439	@Lyndonx And the good old NHS has been using 45 amplifications rendering pretty much any positive test this last year useless..So why the lockdown ? I know, I've listened to Schwab telling us, but so many are still blinded by the covid smoke and mirrors scam....
1290820010022039552	@Steve19252294 I’ve never had a flu shot. My professor years ago had her first smd only flu shot that landed her in the hospital for sever days. She warned us when she returned to campus. I will not take any vaccine for Covid either.

1450182192345190407	@JunkYardBerg I got COVID. Twice. It's been hell each time. I was nearly hospitalized and developed permanent asthma the first time and I am still not recovered from the last time. Sorry you feel that not being reckless with my health after what I experienced is being a sheep.
1513187367678488579	@merlisa @DrOz Has been pushing quack medicine on his shows. His wife is a reiki master and has her come to the hospital to heal is patients. Dr. Phil said we are over reacting Covid that is was just the flu. So far more 800,000 dead. I stand by Quacks.https://t.co/izTgCJwfRu

1401762355206189056	@narendramodi I had COVID positive now it’s been 2 month since covid now I need to wait for 3 month at least for vaccination myself but without vaccination I want to do RT-PCR TEST in ten days and they are costly so now what I need to do .. jay hind
1438492979342331911	@mikepompeo I heard they are treating the vaccinated with Ivermectin if they get COVID in hospital. If you are not vaccinated you get meds that don't actually work, as to make it look like the jab actually works against the virus. Is this true?
1469713700328292357	@havanah_1988 @1Ellingham @tomhfh THANK U. Took exact words out of my mouth!Can people start paying attention?!? Those tests r FRAUD! Flu vanished cuz it was simply called COVID which’s nothing more than latest viral flu strain. Do NOT go to hospital; the “protocols” will kill u then u’ll be tagged COVID death.
1317814614294450177	As an MRI tech, I have seen it all in the hospital. Protect yourselves from #COVID19 which is real!

1352737065696432138	This new Albemarle County webpage made me realize something:More people in Charlottesville and Albemarle have gotten at least one dose of the vaccine than people here who've tested positive for COVID this entire pandemic. https://t.co/DTzjGd06iP
1478860488419201028	My roommate just tested positive for covid and like, yeah she's immediately going to go stay with the family that gave it to her, but shes been here germing up my house for the last two days 😤😤😤
1559370295416442882	@BetsyRi66304373 I have not tested positive and I have traveled around the world the last 2 1/2 years. I think we will all get it eventually. The vaccines and boosters work. Covid is here to stay.
1422154304127971334	@DolioJ Relax and go to the beach! Not all of it is COVID. I have to go to ER today to get the silicone tip from my ear bud removed from my ear. I tried to get it but is in there good. Will probably get a COVID test before they address it. 🤯
1573938588689043456	@cokeandcustard @kbarkermorrison @n_jenkynjones @hannahfearn @mikegalsworthy Don't have covid, how would i infect anyone. 5 minutes in/out literally. Not selfish just have principles &amp; understand facts. Don't even wear them in hospital now. Just because your told something doesnt mean you do it if its crap. You conform by all means. I am not judging you.
1404742229491556361	@happierbuck Not fun, I've had to be tested twice. the first one (when I had covid) was actually not that bad. But the second time when I was in the ER the nurse was NOT gentle. I hope you're negative!!!!
1382444956355153923	@pxtrick01 @twit37070217 @neekolul Why would I take moderna when it’s still a rushed vaccine with unknown side affects? And what about the people who took moderna and still tested positive for Covid? 😂😂. You rely too much on the government to protect you, how about fend for yourself for once and use that brain
1435091943780847619	@NEOsborn @aarieff How do you know the other  ER patients were unvaccinated Covid patients? Did the hospital disclose their private medical information to you? When I’ve been in the ER w my kids did various reasons no one has ever disclosed the reasons for other visits. 🤔
1468845450203697152	Prince is having COVID FOMO 🤣🤣. I also havent tested positive and dont ever want to. Im also fully vaccinated. @TheRealClementM https://t.co/yNciIyftp5
1613394345549234176	@nathaliejacoby1 Me, maybe? I felt a little woozy and under the weather for a week or so in the winter of 2021 but I never tested positive for COVID. It may have been a cold or flu, or it may have been COVID. We'll never know.
1380135202001944578	my entire family i live with has tested positive for covid .-.
1556053615088893952	@ElizabethResist Yes!  I had covid in April of 2020.  I signed up for my first vaccination a week before I tested positive. Since then, I've had 2 shots and 2 boosters and contracted cancer, but have avoided covid despite working in an environment where several other people have tested positive.
1616452488252489728	@MatthewPTyson @DeborahBaigrie The only 2 people I know that died of covid were both killed by Remdesivir. They went to hospital was given Remdesivir and told to come back when they needed a vent. Both of them experience rapid onset kidney failure and death.
1447993230654586882	@GovTimWalz Bullshit!  I know many fully vaccinated people in the hospital with COVID pneumonia!  Wake up!
1525570734466162692	J tested positive for COVID, doc said it would relieve my symptoms if cuties sent me pics of their mouths and tummies idk I'm no expert but that seems wrong
1484092570162515972	@SharazDavid @woolworths So what's the point of mandates, If CC &amp; asymptomatic can go back to work we've  been told for 2 years anything could have covid how's ya supposed to know,I feel like I've had symptoms for 2 yrsPlus who knows if will test positive between 2 &amp; 7 days Precautions mean squat
1376941103107215364	@pip_reaper @TheOnlyGuru @RedsTheBest23 I think the intention was for jersey rather than staff 2 hospitals to move the Covid patients in the hospital which were not in ICU to the nightingale with the staff etc (so the whole ward) when the oxygen supply couldn’t cope in the hospital.

1559649607205785600	@EvryEyeWillCHim As you may presume, i am fully vaccinated, as well as my partner, and two chidren. I was mildly sick overnight, no one else had issues.But when we caught COVID, my toddler was not elegible for one, she was so sick, we took her to ER, while the rest of us was mildly sick.

1427338260242632707	@Apoptos44475462 @SolNataMD Another story I’m hearing from nurses looking after young 20’s patients who have Covid and are hospitalized but so far still conscious-RN:why are you against the vaccine? Patient:we don’t know what’s in it. RN:I just hung 5 IV meds on you and you didn’t ask anything about them!😞
1397278450222837764	@Ravie777 @MrsSMHI Same could be said for cv19 deaths though. Let me try: Absolutely shocking that a hospitalized 80 something with comorbidities would die. Must be the positive covid test 28 days ago.

1414488063200407552	"@21WIRE @ScottMorrisonMP It is extremely likely that those who ""die of (with) COVID"" in a hospital are in reality murdered. Of those I've heard about who ""got COVID"" (the flu) those who stayed home survived. Those who went to hospital didn't."
1473267150072827910	@FPL_Eng So if the vaccine didn’t work then the percentages would be 10% unvaccinated in hospital and 90% vaccinated? I know vaccines can’t prevent death, but 80% of covid deaths being from double and triple vaccinated in the last month is a bit concerning: https://t.co/AAMaLkb7rc

1466411197134110724	@djprossetti @bdomenech I'm thinking it might have something to do with the premise that with the vast majority of people vaccinated (90-95%) the potential strain on health systems will ease as COVID patients in hospital require so much time to recover
1510413115644682243	@ChemGirl314 TY, perfect. I don't HAVE Covid; it's just stopping me from being able to be with someone in hospital!

1582717803353628673	@Lollerwaffle @daveweigel the other issue is that ‘disability’ has become a catch-all and conflates actual disabilities (like blindness) w basically nothing (like self-diagnosed ‘long covid’). so being ableist has no meaning when it also means ‘i have minor anxiety and don’t like what you said’

1383785688571662346	@GFL9112 I’m concerned at the lies MSM and this government have scared people with. Why haven’t we been told how many people have died through non treatment of other illness due to hospital becoming covid hospitals that consist of 1 ward.
1359905256478543872	I think the COVID vaccine is a hoax, because when I went to test it out by going to the COVID floor in the hospital and making out with patients, hospital security kicked me out. Hmm, got something to hide?

1337443378557018115	Yesterday, I joined a #txlege call with Gov. Abbott, &amp; Texas gov. officials discussed the COVID vaccine allocations. If you have already tested positive for COVID, you will not be lower on the priority list. Healthcare workers &amp; our most vulnerable Texans will be eligible first.
1451720581871775746	@scribblingninja I dont think its covid. I'm pretty sure I had covid May last year but because I wasnt hospitalized, I didnt get tested. But it didnt feel like this. This just feels like a standard cold/fluish virid thingemy.

1548445162455478272	@LostFelicia I knkw the feeling, I 2 survived covid forbthe 1st 2 years andbthen I caught it, had it for 3 weeks and i was hospitalized for 4 days before I was able to kick it.
1466862007215341574	Two Hippos 🦛 🦛 in Antwerp Zoo have tested positive for Covid - poor things - I do love Hippos - I spent 20 minutes watching them in Vienna Zoo last summer, so beautiful
1381733539423645702	I'm scared and starting to panic. I read someone had covid 5 weeks after the Johnson shot and he is hospitalized and looks like on a ventilator. I took the shot and now I'm worried if its protecting me 😭
1344991342225731584	@BBCWalesNews 🤔why delay the second vaccine for us who have had the first, reassuring us that we are well protected from the first, so why the hell did I test positive for covid-19 over Christmas 😡
1433580870720446464	@peterrowen_ I don't know anyone who's had covid and gone to hospital or died with it. I know people who think they might have had it mildly before all the testing. I know many who have had adverse events after jabs. One died.
1381841929520865280	@SaniaAhmad1111 Lol, even I know of a doctor from Lucknow who tested positive for covid and was asked if they should give him a negative certificate. All hail uttam pardesh.
1483864377593942018	@williamlegate Someone I know who was triple vaccinated got #COVID19 &amp; they  didn't have to go to the hospital and die. That's the point 👉 #GetVaccinatedNow #WearADamnMask
1408103129829216259	@LeeaCoryea @disclosetv I’m getting over Covid at present. The guy I caught it from was vaccinated. He ended up in the ICU.
1475296004412825607	ngl the way covid had me feeling, i just know i woulda went to the ER if i wasnt vaxxed
1418609514690002946	@amidgley @backatchaslick @GRHutchinson Some people who have had both vaccines are still ending up in hospital I don't go many places anyway and it took them 18 months to see the serious side effects of the swine flu vaccine. Choice is take risk with vaccine or take risk of covid
1456270494949273609	i’ve now seen 2 separate facebook posts of people testing positive for Covid after being at Vegas. Stay safe get tested yall
1540606671420022787	@SusanTo59371651 Hurrrrahhhhhh!!! mummy and daddy tested positive for covid yesterday 😱😱🤒🤒 they say they can’t smell anything… I might test this out  😂😂😂
1381666000593170434	I'm suspect that his case is due to a variant mutation breakthrough. Still, so sorry for him. Man in hospital with COVID-19 after receiving Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine https://t.co/lvV6Md65PI via @nypmetro
1462348520825012225	@mx0r @wilderko I can end up in hospital with covid or any other diseases- one never knows. If 3000 covid patients in hospitals is overflow then we are undeveloped country. Slovakia has 5-6 beds in hospital per 1000 people - do the math yourself
1373981234120986631	@PercursionN @amitmalviya He claimed his corona recovery time starting from 5th .......I don't think anybody will be allowed to meet a corona infected patient in hospital ......at home he can do anything he wants
1518595351908917251	@PokemonGoApp Although nice mon for a CD and i managed to catch a few shinies… since i have covid (got diagnosed on thursday) i couldnt go out so i played at my apt wouldve been nice if its spawned more with incense specially since no stop/gym near… but regardless i caught a few😅 https://t.co/ZkGKvMkk9w
1354507481087696906	@JPerschino She claims if you get the vaccine, U test positive for COVID, because you got the antibodies-which means you'll always have it &amp; BigPharma keeps making $$ &amp; that's how the Gov is going to control us....You have watch it. I'm not responsible if you throw up though! 🤢🤮🤮
1507651445608308738	@jesflres I am triple faxed, have never had a positive covid test result but I had three colds in quick succession during the winter, is it possible they were covid as the home tests are not 100% reliable.
1488715101423259655	@TheBSnod @nathaliejacoby1 My roommate is vaccinated &amp; tested positive for covid last month, they had absolutely no symptoms. Luckily I did not catch it.
1457526821310844933	@richardursomd Ty! I had an injury yesterday and had to go to emergency room. I was pleased to have a recovered nurse and dr.The dr said early on having had so many Covid patients she thought it was a good idea to get the jab.She got Covid a few months later and no longer trusts the FDA.
1379124761247281153	@EdenKzr Went to the hospital, had a panic attack shortly after getting the COVID vaccine so I thought it might have been a bad reactionI'm fine tho~
1443893124716285953	@Sleng401 Yes I have. Got tested positive for COVID 5 weeks with no symptoms. Currently got the flu and far worse
1449834523596759041	@killrogue55 @chrisp2605 @Danza109 Certainly not a “ fake flu” my partner worked on a covid ward last year and said it was the worst thing she has ever seen. Don’t wish it upon people, but maybe you need to get it and be stuck into icu for a few weeks to realise how real it is.
1442333165763260419	@KathrynWiebe2 Also, I weighed the vaccine risks vs covid and choose the vaccine. I’d rather die from the vaccine than suffocating alone in the hospital.
1434869566845358089	@NewsTalkWNDB broadcasted this lying trash and his lies have caught up with him. How many of @NewsTalkWNDB’s listeners believed this asshole and are now hospitalized with Covid? @MarcBernierShow @NewsTalkWNDB is NEGLIGENT. I wonder how long until the class action lawsuits?
1540913123766460417	@SuziSteffen I'm honestly no longer sure.  But at Easter three key people I spent a lot of time with tested positive for Covid and were ill. I tested negative and was ill with the same symptoms and am still post viral. I decided to act as if I had a positive test.
1415879944681385987	@CFAinstitute I am Chaitya Surana, a CFA Level 1 candidate (CFA ID:9750192 ). I had booked the slot for Level 1 exam (August attempt). However, I tested positive for Corona Virus on May 20th, immediately before the slot booking window for August attempt closed.
1483801234171731973	@EW @tylerperry I’m in the hospital with Covid. This made me feel wonderful!  WB Madea!
1478738280782852097	My roomate got positive now. If I will do covid test maybe result will be positive but I can't do the test because tomorrow is our semester exam and if I don't give exam then it will be declared fail. Hat's off to you VSSUT, Burla.@CMO_Odisha @otvnews @CovidIndiaSeva @HFWOdisha

1454063431942737924	Opposing counsel I saw in court yesterday emailed me and the judge last night that they have tested positive for Covid-19. Thankfully, we both have been vaccinated and were wearing masks (as required by our state's Supreme Court).Nonetheless, vigilance is still the watchword.
1386800574822326276	Lmao this is literally not true.I had one dose of the vaccine, was exposed to someone with covid and guess what?Vaccine won every time. Never tested positive the FOUR tests I took. Stop fucking believing the lies.
1476975695972630529	@MetalSD_68 @Restlessmom1 @fox5sandiego Yeah. It was diagnosed at NMCSD and I had to talk to infectious diseases about it. I was getting sick all 2019 and they escorted me off base Oct, 2019 (hello start of Covid) without properly treating me.
1606615520811401216	@anilmistry I was very achey, sleepy and no energy yesterday but tested negative. Today a lot better but positive. My first Covid too (that I’m aware off).  Hey well too mate 🙌
1431988745277001735	@Collect47 @MarcBernierShow I'd say that is your own issue equating the word grim with death. Being hospitalized with COVID is grim, as Bernier eventually found out.
1435712257426604032	@shreddedshredz @itsagir15496562 @DavidAnber 2/I was tested for CoVid in ER- neg.  Still dealing with vertigo -positional. Worse when turning head/ laying down.  I asked if the two things happening were related. No. I asked if it could have been the vaccine. Again, no.
1443221949547753473	@briantylercohen You are just stupid! I am so tired of theses ignorant people! I have been taking care of Covid patients since the beginning of the pandemic and I am tired! People like this lady are just selfish. Since you think like this, do not come to the hospital when you get the virus.
1440793179561738243	@TimesSport @legsidelizzy @hzeffman Having seen the headlines coming out of Australia, I think his intervention will be as welcome as a positive Covid test there right now.
1472910914122919938	@officialstevoid @DominicRaab I'm unvaccinated and shrugged COVID off. Ask the people who bought and sold these vaccines on the premise of them being 95% effective against infection. Bugger all to do with healthy unvaccinated people. Most in hospital with COVID are vaccinated and only 3% being treated for it
1553520022257016833	Just back from a week in the beautiful Isle of Skye -perfect- even saw dolphins and sea-eagles- downside coming home present- Ralf &amp; I have now tested positive for Covid 😩 https://t.co/IVUs4R1o7E
1470954263237074944	@Jusrangers And they are ALL given weekly COVID tests. The two students I know who go there both tested positive for Covid...asymptomatic.

1425891559690678279	@SirAstrix @Breaking911 @wbaltv11 I know reading isn’t your strong suite, but try and keep up. Infected with the SC2 virus is not Covid and none of them died, 7 were hospitalized, a drop in the bucket compared to the unvaccinated pool we have going on.
1483524205564080130	I have an honest question...my health center just told me they don't retest to see if you're over covid because it's possible to test positive for up to 90 days. I thought you had covid if you test positive. Does this mean you can HAVE covid for up to 90 days? Confusing.
1568034993825513473	@teddipasketty Wait, you mean I knew something before you did, tested positive for Covid. *and* received a totally unexpected follow all on the same day? Dayum, and yes, a tragic story.
1392901215781011459	@youngjaneymsk That’s very sad - however, I’ve had the opposite - only mild cases of Covid - no worse than flu! A family member not taken to hospital and left to die at home ! Neglect BECAUSE of saving the NHS for Covid!
1478802495220633605	Ok so I fucked up, I pranked my girlfriend by telling her that I went to hospital to get a test for Covid while I didn’t but 😂😂😂 yeah I know, she will kill me now, rip Jack May your soul will be in peace 😂😂
1455600043449327630	I tweeted yesterday that 95% of ppl in the hospital were covid patient. What I meant to say was 95% of people who has covid in the hospital are unvaccinated. Hope this clears it up. Sorry.
1601425810329849857	@benjean2 I haven’t tested positive yet, but I’m still dealing with the cold I had (including a sinus infection that I’m on antibiotics for), but this afternoon took a turn downhill for me. Plus our 3 year old tested positive for COVID today, so just a matter of time before we all have it! https://t.co/kAcOT4hPLV
1555980357287219202	@editorsneedlov1 @drsimonegold I personally know 7 people in the hospital rt now that have Covid. Every one of them are double boosted!! I don’t know anyone who is unvaxxed and sick🤷‍♂️
1555005562861113344	@Puffsthemagicd1 @Hbomb08119074 @jamiecam43 @SarahFischer__ @JustinTrudeau So tell me how, scientifically it makes sense. Me, as  unvaxed couldn't board a plane/train/boat domestically or internationally, with a covid negative test. But you could, without a test, which means you could board being covid positive. As a scientist, I wouldn't ok that.
1365246722008625154	@amandapalmer Absolutely yes. I had COVID in January and though I never had to be hospitalized, it was bad. I’m still experiencing lingering symptoms. When it’s my turn, I’m getting a vaccine.
1450134607597383682	@video_link @covidtweets After seeing media and ZeroCoviders use a 14yo who was in hospital dying of terminal brain cancer as proof of covid being dangerous to kids here, I think you're probably right that a non-zero number of that 276 does not have covid as the but-for cause of their death.
1380042794593439744	@GingerGano Was in contact with a Covid positive person at work and I had to take a test but haven't since. Have had a sore throat and the occasional cough but no more testing for me.
1453522623535665152	I'm overjoyed for Jamal, his children and their family. After 95 days in the hospital due to covid and giving birth early, Cierra is finally leaving!!  The doctors initially told him to put her in hospice but Jamal said no. Their journey has been amazing to witness. https://t.co/TYA4vhve8f
1417253429576179716	@Timcast Considering that my wife is not vaccinated and is in ICU with COVID-related ARDS and was placed on a ventilator Saturday after being in the hospital for 3-4 weeks, I don't even know when I took her to the ER now, I am going to get vaccinated.
1367271317871886336	@PAWGsForBernie Same. Got covid a few weeks back and ended up in the hospital. Would like the vaccine before my sweet, sweet antibodies disappear.
1440136838606467072	@BryBrightside Ten days later I got a sinus infection, got antibiotics but the doc told me to get a covid19 test anyways. 3 doses into the antibiotics three sinus infection was gone, two days later the backlogged lab sent my covid19 test back as a positive.

1511491418375823362	@clhubes @MamaWeasleyy Oh yes. March 2020 baby, then my toddler was hospitalized for two weeks from covid and almost died. So uhhhhh yeah. I’ve gone into a pharmacy to pick up medications and taken the kids to their doctor. End of list of buildings I’ve entered for over two years.
1479739115671273474	Love that I tested positive for Covid just in time for me to binge watch The Hype House (stfu) and Euphoria 🤪
1436167253859475464	@Kurt1775 @mkhammer I know one who did not survive - he was in extremely poor health prior to contracting the virus.I know one who was in generally good health who had to be hospitalized for 2 days.I know one who is suffering long covid since 1/1.I know one who just kicked it with ivermectin+. https://t.co/6Nl2X4U13f
1488425469162700804	Feeling pretty rough today with a heavy cold but I’ll go to work and go about my business as usual. Meanwhile symptomless people are taking time off work because they test positive for Covid. There still appears to be a mania for testing and isolation. This has to stop.
1336539982966755329	@caro_afc Is that different than the kennel cough vaccine?  I didn’t even know a flu shot for dogs was a thing.  You know you love your dog more than yourself when your first phone call after a positive Covid test is to the vet to make sure your dog will be OK.
1478429016252194827	"@h3h3productions I know 15 covid cases. 1 went to hospital for 2 days on oxygen.2 were sick bad at home.The rest were half/half light/no symptoms.Thats about statistically average.  Not really a ""rare"" scenario."

1380604181468352515	my gf tested positive for covid, she doesnt have severe symptoms, but still not good, also means i most likely have it too, i get tested tmr
1323129187788595200	@Bellatrixx2020 @JoeBiden I had to get a covid test yesterday because someone I had contact w is positive. I spent almost 6 hours in line to get a test. I told my wife who was with me that imagine if trump is in charge of vaccine distribution it is going to be chaos.
1387392944802566147	@BitcoinBrantley @KDKA Im glad your covid experience was quick and painless, but you have to respect that isn’t the common experience. I am young, was healthy. Masks, Ive been safe. I was hospitalized with respiratory failure and can’t breathe without help now. I don’t want others to feel this too.
1425535039031422981	Does anyone have the data of people who have recovered from covid and have tested positive for a second time? Or are we not concerned about that?(and i don’t wanna see a study from any company who makes a vaccine)
1437061026449481730	@jasondogwood If tfg wasn't there, it's not drawing a crowd of 1000s. However, I would love to see statistics on how many MAGAts have died from COVID this year by refusing to listen to the science and get vaccinated. We know that 95+% of hospitalized COVID patients are not vaxxed.
1512854255270612998	fuck man i managed to avoid it for over 2 years but i just tested positive for covid 🥲🥲🥲 this shit sux
1388255518385340417	I managed to avoid getting COVID but I have now been in the hospital the last 24 hours with a kidney stone. I guess I just want to say even when you get the vaccination be mindful of your health always. It is protecting yourself AND others.
1481080039416516616	@AaronNagler you liked a tweet from a lefty blue checkmark comparing the covid vax to a polio shot. Care to share with me how many ppl came down with polio after the shot compared to those who tested positive after the covid shot, and booster, and 3rd booster. I'm all ears.
1400383344131510275	@Kabamur_Taygeta Backtrack bro, carona family of viruses been around longer than you &amp; I. Covid19 is the flu rebranded though man, it's not a lab-escaped pathogen or from bat soup 🤣 Cases are amplified PCR test results or falsely diagnosed.
1507861786313306117	@groenlachen We found out after he was moved from ED to ICU that it’s one visitor the entirety of the stay - no switching.  They actually made an exception (I didn’t ask for it) so I got about a half hour.  He is COVID+ but he had in Jan so we actually don’t think it’s the root issue.
1501428105860108296	i dont...really understand, why do people post publicly about being covid positive?and then attach a picture of the test result to provide evidence?
1347675539411185664	@BBCNEandCumbria Well I’m booked in for my Pfizer vaccine on 27/1 and I will make sure I keep my appointment. I’ve already tested positive for Covid in April 2020 and would prefer not to get it again especially in my role as a nurse.  I understand some people are wary about the vaccine.
1425118451492921349	@kylegriffin1 Did I miss the segment covering the science/data that showed nurses giving/spreading covid to all their patients in the hospital?
1426686253605531649	I want to understand The ppl who deny the science in mask wearing &amp; vaccinations to fight covid19 are now going to the ER &amp; asking medicine/science to save them? They're now taking beds that oh I don't know A HEART ATTACK VICTIM MIGHT NEED??? GOT IT
1456696193728147457	I don’t know who needs to hear this but even though you got the COVID-19 vaccine you can still catch and pass the virus around. It lowers your chances to be hospitalized. That is all.
1480919581388591115	My office had 13 people test positive for COVID yesterday. Just yesterday alone. Luckily I’m working from home (and healthy thankfully) but please stay home if you can. Wear a good mask if you have to go somewhere. Get tested if you’re around people. Also Larry is real.
1437804762892849162	@StephenKing @Nortonsmom You can still get it right ? You can still be hospitalized right ? You so called elite celebs swear you know what’s best. But with all your money and influence why not push for free Cemo ? Or insulin? I mean diabetes and cancer kills more people then Covid ever will.
1386344575107702786	@scarneck_arpit @Interceptors Let me tell you the reality.. Most of the people doing test just to get mild fever, and if report is positive than asking for beds.. even they have mild symptomsAb actually jiski need hogi usko bed nahi milega . Corona se jayada panic hai logo mein.
1386036525599764484	@sbattrawden a year ago today i was admitted to hospital with covid-related sepsis. this demonstration makes me so sad. i don't understand how so many people still won't recognise the danger of covid and why they are so unwilling to wait a little bit longer.
1380499872235802624	@alexbrooks But that doesn’t cover the outcome of testing weekly post covid? Do you isolate again? I think this is what needs further guidance. Work aren’t going to accept constant covid absences. So how long after a positive test should you wait to commence weekly testing? @UKgovcomms
1440685365736607752	@AP4Liberty I’m in this car crash and my guts are all hanging out and shit and I don’t have my Austin vax pass. Rapid test comes back positive so now I’m a Covid stat and the doc doesn’t have to be bothered with trying to put my guts back inside my belly.
1375133451414863876	@ITVCentral @uniofleicester That would make me very nervous about going into hospital if I had Covid. I had it early last year with no problems I have high blood pressure and was a smoker all my life.
1525253407224827911	@Codycollins9150 @melissax1125 100% wrong no one said that. It helps keep you out of the hospital and/or body bag. I had Covid prior to a vaccine. Trust me, you wouldn’t be spouting off if you were like me and was hospitalized. 23 year old that was in the same room with me left to go to his grave.

I’m convinced she’s immune
1426664580617486339	@Ladzo60 I will say that that a few of the ER physicians at a large nearby hospital have told me that not a single vaxxed individual has been hospitalized with COVID complications recently. It’s anecdotal, but interesting.

1387245363908681732	I'm immune compromised and getting COVID would more than likely put me in the hospital which would mean that my kiddo wouldn't have anyone to look after her. So yeah I'm getting vaccinated.
1345610743173980160	I am just glad getting my second dose of #COVID19 vaccine next week! There is going to be no end to this madness! Don’t wanna think of Mid-January in hospital 🤦‍♀️ https://t.co/arIvp65OJ5
1381071254661304328	😔🙏 I'm still taking care of covid patients in the ICU. I can't express it enough to please be safe,  wear your masks, and don't let your guard down...These patients are so young and it breaks my heart. Please. Please be careful. I'm so exhausted. I yearn for normalcy.
1373599307891404800	"just wanting to know .If there are 1.4 mill Covid tests carried out on 18th March and only 5500 positive results does that mean everyone who went for the test just had a ""cold "" ?.. genuinely want to know /am I missing something ?Are the Gov still mass testing healthy communities"
1468113888755568640	@cozzalee8 I know seven people who died from COVID since September 2020.  Early treatment is critical, such as the FLCCC’s iMASK+ protocol.  Such a disaster to have Americans told to wait to go to the hospital until having trouble breathing.  No.  Get treated early. https://t.co/RCymzFilhj
1434631657336684545	@Leftylockdowns1 I was at a wedding a month ago. Found out two days later that 2 at my table had come down w/ COVID the day after. One was hospitalized. Both had been vaxxed a few months earlier.We can’t survive as a society looking around suspiciously at who’s vaxxed or not. That’s not living.
1428543218002452486	@thehill I don't understand.  Does he get the same level of medical care as the people whom he serves?  It is not that I don't wish him a full recovery; it is just that we would like to feel equality is meted out, in terms of treatment, when Covid is diagnosed.
1503079780656324608	@StarofZ @RealDeniseWelch @Socialnotwork72 @toadmeister I caught covid recently , unvaccinated. As did my partner. We stayed at home until we were well. This is common sense. Shock horror, we didn't go into ICU. How does waving your Ukraine hearts around keep anyone safe?It's this kind of logic that has me baffled.
1588770265106092032	"@Chesschick01 Yeah, if you look into ""long COVID"", it's vaguely defined as pretty much any lingering symptom. Just like any other respiratory illness. When I had a deviated septum, any cold turned into a sinus infection. 1/3 of COVID cases aren't still in the hospital 3 months later."
1435710302524424201	@ohhhhthatsnice @UnionScenes @PoliticsForAlI @theipaper that’s weird, i’ve been ill once in the last 18 months, and i’d taken a covid test a few days before and it was positive, but every other test i did came back negative
1350360098426773504	My Nan had it last week,so far so good but I believe she probably had Covid in April with no symptoms as grandad was tested positive during that time so more than likely she got natural immunity anyway so to me seem like unnecessary risk her taking vaccine
1471640795878993922	@MollyJongFast We almost need to air-drop at-home COVID tests all over the state with instructions for if they test positive. It might cut down on some of this. It’s crazy avoidable. I can’t believe democide isn’t a crime. I can’t believe this is USA. But it is—we need to deal w/it.
1613852902799429632	I was diagnosed with POTS and EDS about a decade ago and I’m proud that I’ve managed to manage the symptoms to the point where I lead a relatively ‘normal’ life. Yet this bout of covid has exactly brought the symptoms back 😞I hope it’s temporary
1388188719879004161	Hey, @TuckerCarlson. Our 10-year-old's soccer teammate just tested positive for COVID-19. None are vaccinated -- they're 10. Syd had a life-threatening autoimmune disorder when she was small. My wife's recovering from chemo/breast cancer. Please, I beg you, don't do this stuff.
1418470681105240076	@proysalts Yes, the person who tested positive picked it up in Nanjing, I was lucky, same day I came back from Nanning - only one letter away from Covid😅🤣🤣
1373800041119367171	@fact_covid It will be really good to know ( I do expect &amp; really hope the answer is ZERO or very very low ) is how many of the people that have been vaccinated have either tested positive again or had to go into hospital or have (hopefully not)died of Covid 19?
1527996977656565760	@AprilFinn8 @pulte I understand where you are coming from. My husband &amp; I worked so hard to be where we are at but got behind before covid bc I was in the hospital for a month &amp; things got better but covid hit &amp; since then no matter how hard we try, everytime things look like we might be fine &amp;
1443173586773086211	"@KamalaHarris I believe a tRumpster staff member on ""The View"" orchestrated that fake ""positive results on Covid Test"" scenario."

1485405236248428546	@specialreport4u Maybe because most of us have seen what this thing can do. I know one person who died after getting it and a 26 year old male who had a heart attack the same week he got the first. 2 people who ended up in the ER right after their first. 3 who got Covid after.
1436532910325121029	just wanted to say wearing masks, having a vaccine, and regularly washing your hands works!!! I’ve been around 7 people who have tested positive in a close and closed environment for an internship. 7 COVID tests and 2 weeks later I’ve stayed negative 🤪
1475869169388343300	@mchmiel @Woland1233 @prchovanec My wife and I caught covid last month.  We did not go to the hospital.  But we know plenty of people who would, given the exact same symptoms.  Hospitalizations are a ridiculous measuring stick - just like counting a head on car collision as a covid death.  Only government.....
1522820737052340224	@_ksjack @profmiketoole I doubt it would be under reporting,   would be an over reporting problem Nearly everyone who went to hospital for anything was tested for covid, especially after RATs were widely available. So people went to hospital with other problems &amp; died with covid. Tassie separates this https://t.co/XhzUqtP311
1422285652998033423	I can’t emphasize this enough, you can still catch covid even if you’re vaccinated...the vaccine helps keep your symptoms from being so bad you need to be hospitalized for it.
1468676952819126282	@doctor_oxford Oh ffs can you just stop lying!!! We all have internet and access to data! We actually know how many people are in hospital! I stopped obeying rules after I had covid+2 jabs! I’M DONE with this bullshit!
1466741359092641798	@SamJMcKay @BrokerNurse @BareReality I'm sure I have read accounts coming out now of vaccinated who have caught covid and still get long covid and ended up in hospital requiring specialist care. I know in my local hospital most covid patients in hospital are vaccinated elderly.

1454584526118719500	@Gabriel85385955 @TwilightZone_ie @peterrowen_ I ain't vaccinated. But was taken in with chest pain  4 weeks ago got CT confirmed blood clots on lung. They blamed it on contraceptive pill but were also blaming it on fact I tested positive for Covid on 4th June 🤦🤦.
1375545973351518214	@lucyinthesky380 I've a terrible needle phobia too. Was in a state getting my vaccine but 100% know it was a tiny price to pay vs getting Covid19 and ending up in hospital, or worse dying and a horrible death at that. The more of us who get it, the more we all get our lives back. Good luck👍🏼
1481242753891770371	@Dnesij What concerns me about the story is the allegations that he met others shortly after a positive Covid test. Whilst the fiasco is no doubt newsworthy, it shouldn’t be making headlines for days on end whilst climate gets buried as usual.
1595148613734350886	@LexSportsCards @JKDMind @Keh_nyay @maxberger @elonmusk @DineshDSouza The problem I saw with a lot of the early studies on ivermectin for COVID Tx was that the sample population were predominately severe hospitalized covid patients.Research 101: if you want the diminish the efficacy of a drug, use it on more severely/terminally ill populations 1/
1418309737062469637	@charliekirk11 Please explain to us how they know the Delta variant from Covid 19. It is my understanding that the same exact test is used. Positive or negative results only. We are super curious.

1459849966789275648	@shintomac Yes I believe I did have Covid back in 2020 in April, but wasn’t tested but definitely had the symptoms. Now there’s tests about, I can confirm I have got a positive Covid result. Sadly
1445066321020997652	@AlanfromBigEasy Bc they were marking anyone “with covid like symptoms” as a death regardless of a positive test or not.

1471885970630971394	@g_in_cle @juliankhan Didn’t mean to be confusing. I work in an environment where lots of people are sick with covid symptoms but they aren’t officially diagnosed as having covid because they don’t bother to get tested. And many are unvaccinated.
1386683560208240640	Yeesh. Get both shots, people!Maybe you'll be like me, needing a day of rest &amp; pampering. Maybe you'll be like my kids &amp; have just a slightly sore arm.What you WON'T be is hospitalized with a severe covid infection 🤷‍♀️
1382023995667677188	@ShaunLintern @RCEMPolicyVP @RCollEM I hope we aren’t sleepwalking into  another wave of severe Covid admissions. That would be so depressing after all the effort we put in &amp; wouldn’t be fair in the ICU &amp; acute medical teams to put them through that again either.

1510485846931214338	Good news: my husband doesn’t have Covid. Bad news: It’s some monster strep/virus that maybe was contagious and led to an abscess so I took him to the ER at 9:30. Good news: They got him fixed up and 🤞 his basement banishment and 😷 will keep the baby safe.
1510226941021892609	@Record_Factory @dr_khan1234 @Jerry_grey2002 I’m fully vaccinated. You think those Covid cases are from who are not vaccinated in our company? We are all vaccinated. Out of those who have been tested positive, some even had 3 shots. Vaccination doesn’t mean you won’t get Covid.

1385629059539869700	@CathJSweeney 9 hospitalized? I thought the vaccine was supposed to prevent serious illness? 😣Maybe the more relevant statistic would be 137 breakthrough cases vs how many total COVID positives for that time period?

1373412726316396544	Alright, so if I get COVID and end up in the hospital or worse, I'm giving permission to any respectable journalist who wants to follow the case from diagnosis to the end result. No, I don't want to sell it - I want the story told so that maybe deniers will stop denying.
1528765052274212864	"Merkley announces he has covid:  ""I took a COVID test that came back positive. I’m experiencing mild symptoms so far — I know that can change — and attribute that to being vaccinated and boosted."""

1374396649229873157	@dhmontgomery Also, the stage of vaccination at which they were diagnosed with COVID (i.e. a couple of days after the 1st shot then they got COVID). Just seems like useful information to illustrate to the public how/when the vaccine fully goes into effect.

What they need to be letting people know is to lose weight - 80% hospitalized with covid were obese
1433966114044788737	i'm sure it's just bronchitis, because i'm both fully vaxxed and never leave the house - but it's like I can't go to my gp with it bc they don't let you in if you've been coughing and I can't go to hospital bc it's full of unvaxxed covid patients

1383126001434132482	@suzibitch1 Yes, I get the CDC update on my phone. One person died, some had to be hospitalized. Remember this Covid 19 has MUTATIONS the longer people go unvaccinated.
1382045350958088194	@Smilan317 Did you ever test positive for Covid before getting the vaccine? I wonder if you had it but were not symptomatic. I'm hearing those who already had it get stronger reactions to the vax.
1387880781511417858	@DJayC4 @globaltravel62 @ItsSamG And the reality is thousands of fully vaccinated individuals have contracted Covid, some have been hospitalized or died. I wouldn’t be traveling currently, not w/ the covariants. My fear is the vaccinated will let down their guard &amp; covariants will spread. https://t.co/P5MgEoseh7
1376627755660496901	@sushi173 Yeah, I remember reading that too. Absolutely terrifying. You're also more likely to get a clot from a random plane flight or from being hospitalized with covid than AZ, so..
1506456468429709314	@DonaldJTrumpJr Well, I’ve tested positive for Covid. I’ve got some mild cold symptoms but am feeling fine.  I’m more grateful than ever for the protection of my own immune system.  Please, use your judgement.
1548627795726704640	@PeterHotez @CDCgov If one has Covid without knowing and spike protein present in blood test, is waiting for #4 smart? Is there any way to understand more about a positive antibody test result? I was so happy that I not contracted Covid and now this blood test news has floored me.
1475955029970403341	@FayeTozerCrush @_ClaireRichards @Faye_Tozer @Ianhwatkins @LSLofficial @llatchfordevans @OfficialSteps same! I dont know what's going on with it, personally I havent seen anything to suggest it was filmed, and I dont think it would be any of the venues past the mid way point cos Faye and Lee both tested positive for covid.
1416576434521317377	@bmlong137 @BretWeinstein Also, the chance of my own child going to the hospital this month is slim, but the chances of someone needing an Ark hospital while it’s full of unvaccinated Covid patients next week is actually very high. The unvaccinated are putting OTHER people at risk.

1438847624396918785	@bellisaurius I just want to note our convo around unvaxed is really perverseIf your goal was to get ppl vaxed all you do is show how 90% of hospitalized ppl are unvaxed *and* say mitigation efforts are BSPpl need to understand you will encounter Covid unless you live in a cabin forever
1465726120842694656	@RayDoesData I think what’s skewing the numbers is the fact a lot of the hospitalization this month are people who caught it while in the hospital so not necessarily in hospital due to CovidWhereas October people were mainly in hospital due to Covid and then deaths ensued
1544955873423917056	have never tested positive for Covid, just get random illness symptoms that cost me work time every 4-6 weeks, love it for me
1475971428516184064	@bruceymonkey @madrid_mike It's not just leaving the disabled.  There was a UK or India study on Delta where a huge percent of people post-hospital died or returned to hospital - something like 20%, within 140 days I think.Those people died of side effects, not counted as COVID deaths for the stats
1611118320450932736	@L_A_Baker If you were in the hospital with Covid and they said this vaccine will save you’re life I think you would be someone to take a vaccine.
1483086309044412423	@esdude67 @RealCandaceO I am 24 years old and have gotten over covid twice now with comorbities... without going to the hospital. Speak for yourself! thank you!
1614369498861109254	@jacksonsaysso @sherbarossi1 @jamessmithPT_ I tested positive for COVID and had zero symptoms, I wasn’t vaxxed at the time and this was the supposedly stronger 2020 strain…what’s your point?
1442974716344500224	Got my covid booster yesterday. First 2 shots mild. This booster feels like run over by truck. Still better than ending up on ventilator in hospital.
1485617740127911949	I thought I had run out of luck when I tested positive for Covid – but I won £1m the next day in EuroMillions jackpot https://t.co/dEJ78e1ah4

1486708861201354758	When I was feeling sick a couple days ago and had work, I had a hard time getting tested for COVID as I didn’t have any RATs available to use. Luckily enough, my employer happened to have an extra RAT in the office. I was thankful for this because I did indeed test positive.
1475699992669016068	"Not a scientific survey, but I'm suddenly seeing lots of people on FB saying they ""just had Covid"" reporting that they have now tested positive again.

1386336188869525505	@Alex_Panetta It is not this way for everyone. I had no negative reactions to either Pfizer shot and I was never diagnosed with COVID. I actually felt great the next morning after the second shot.
1440031097811652608	@TudorChick1501 Please get vaxed, stay masked, continue social distancing. Do it so maybe our children can experience a life without masks and fear. I was hospitalized w/covid, in ICU 3 days. I am blessed, not as bad as many. It is real. Recovery is slow.
1430739425823268868	2 of my unvaccinated family members have been hospitalized with Covid-19. I work at a place that makes part of what makes the vaccines work. Been doing that for 20 yrs. At this point, I'm at a loss.
1387062184912453632	@Nidhi I had covid last year. Was a tough 7-10 days . Was even admitted to the hospital. Even this will pass 🙏
1384863601140305928	@originaf3spirit @mrchrisjohn That was my theory that after the vaccine we would test positive for a period of time (perhaps 3+ weeks). They should have told people who might have made holiday plans. Effectively a covid19 carrier - as far as tests are concerned.

1558494125971865602	If you still test positive for COVID after 5 days but you feel ok, #CDC says wear a #mask &amp; go back to school! Ok. How many are wearing a #mask? How many will wear a mask w/ this new rule? I agree @jeremyfaust - this will cause more spread.
1412080183004348417	@SasheelKarthik @adnan_unoficial @pathfinderop @formularacers_ Not sure but I think there was nothing about George because it is planned before in which team will netflix record especially with covid regulations, so they could not change it to merc when Lewis tested positive. Correct me if I am wrong
1377610462242734084	@CindyReynolds @cgfirebrand @ChonWayne5 @FINALLEVEL I mean it seems pretty hard to actually get covid as I’ve gone over a year in public everyday and havent tested positive still… but I also wear a mask somewhat by choice at this point.. so maybeee
1502652205060476928	@UnitedStandMUFC @samuelluckhurst I first read this as “produced a forged positive COVID test” and while my eyebrows raised, I wasn’t even that shocked that something like that would happen in the state we’re in.
1474547976844496896	how do i know if my covid test is a fake positive
1479532103377244170	@ACSial @MSNBC Why is it so difficult to follow up with a PCR test to confirm…? At least if a rapid test is positive, you are likely, truly, positive. Same goes for pregnancy tests but I digress - Canadian snowbird. Florida is nothing but a cesspool of COVID with #DeathSantis at the helm.

I’m so glad to hear you made a full recovery because long covid appears to be identical to what I have and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.
1445798243716247554	Honestly, after getting through the worst of covid, then being tested positive for it after I started to feel better, I do feel a little better after the medication now, hopefully it's down hill from here and I can get back to work when I can, just gotta get through quarantine.
1482320913018335237	@DownTheRabbit1 @ToniaBuxton @mattletiss7 The company would have to renew all employees contacts first of all. Unless stated in their work contacts they cannot refuse to pay. Plus people vaccinated are off ill with covid as my mate was in hospital for 2 weeks after having his booster so not sure what their trying to do?
1485547857071702016	As an unvaccinated Victorian who caught covid on November 30 in 2021. I did not clog up any hospital beds, let alone the imaginary 4K ICU beds Dan and the ALP promised, then never delivered. I smashed Covid within 26 hours. Asked by DHHS to go to hospital for an infusion, said No
1553059298376384513	@StarTribune That’s what I got, the Moderna and the 3rd as well. I haven’t got Covid, at least not yet. I did hear that Covid will become like the flu and stick around but that the Vaccine helps in preventing death or being in the hospital for a long time. Get the vaccine people!
1449307639922368524	@SharnelleVella I have noticed the number of people in hospital in NSW has stayed high. On average how long are COVID patients spending in hospital? Thanks for everything you’re doing, really helpful to see the info presented like this.
1433771988082991105	I guess you could call Asthma a pre-existing condition. So having just got over Covid without having to spend anytime in hospital, you could say vaccines work. If anyone asks, I'm triple jabbed now. 🤙🏾
1386003384101220355	@ErinBrockovich Completely.I went to a 20 person funeral last week and got a call today that 2 people were diagnosed with Covid. I have to reschedule my vaccination appointment while I quarantine for the next two weeks.
1530540546485362689	@PhilipSoos @Jikkyleaks @fynn_fan @KathMLee1 @ichudov Was at my hair salon this week.

To most, the news seemed a total shock.  Media is covering up the adverse reactions
1431801161208664068	@Lesleycubawelly In Australia something like 50% of those are in there due to a nervous condition brought on by the fear of having caught covid. Im not saying there arent many that are respiratory sick but 40% of cases in hospital can mean something entirely different
1483039318834823168	i never wanted my covid test to be positive so bad...
1553644379411058688	@DrFrascatore @Capt_Caffiend Second this. I can confidently say COVID was worse than the meningitis I had in 2014 that put me in hospital for two weeks. Going to be doing everything I can not to get it ever again (and I was already being pretty careful). Thinking about getting a 2nd booster overseas. 🥴
1479256433828851714	This was a problem before Covid. I remember taking my gma to the hospital with shortness of breath, in and out of consciousness and overhearing people checking themselves in to the ER bc they “have symptoms of a cold” 🥴🥴🥴

1371142500312879108	@betsyspangles Not what I'm looking for.  It's the deaths from covid not the adverse reactions to the vaccine.  It's strange they have no data if we are to understand the efficacy.  I now know of 3 people who have had the jab but diagnosed and died after receiving it.
1471844631155515393	@Sharpeire @BridgesAndrew this entire thread was about the vax preventing covid.  You changed the narrative to hospital stats, hey that's fine.  I would do the same knowing this: Ireland ~80% vax rate and your a covid cesspool with a rate 569% higher than Florida &amp; near pre vax rates. https://t.co/I1ispGpCk0

1441088508467187721	My kid got concert tickets for his b-day and we took him to get a negative Covid test as required by the venue. It came back positive. His doctor refused to administer a PCR test and he couldn’t attend school. We got a PCR test at the health department:  NEGATIVE.

May as well tell me he died of Covid since he tested positive for that as well. If I'm suffocating and you kneel on my neck, YOU killed me
1559607723595005953	Finally made myself eat some bread and cheese, despite my lack of appetite. Now I feel uncomfortably bloated.Pretty much convinced (not diagnosed and unlikely to be) that I'm going through a variation on the Long Covid theme - nowhere near as bad as many, but it's hard enough.
1449792987454713866	@guardian the only people i know who’ve gotten covid, not to mention hospitalized for it, have been fully vaccinated.

1424495967600930816	@mahky_maak 🤷🏻‍♀️  At this point I have no sympathy for unvaccinated folks who catch covid. Vaccinated people who catch it are extremely unlikely to be hospitalized. And sadly, because of the unvaccinated, the virus is probably here for good now

1486576238567247872	i'll have to get tested for covid again i hope it's positive this time I WANT TO BE AWAY FROM THIS WOMAN
1379894559044419796	I feel the best I've been since before testing positive for COVID-19. My taste and smell is slowly coming back. My quarantine is up in about another couple days. Hopefully my next COVID test comes back negative
1380294548027490308	The one year anniversary story I want to read is a check in on that tiger who tested positive for covid at the Bronx Zoo.
1513386419095588867	@frankinhtown16 @newguy1234542 @MathewMoisture @willem_acker I know more people who ended up in hospital after vaccination than w/covid
1502134858545434625	@DirtyThirtyRN I remember the first COVID patient I had the health department refused to test them because they were flu positive and we were told he didn’t meet criteria for testing.
1512174214282948615	COVID wave at the Capitol continues. GOP ME Sen Collins tests positive. Collins: Senator Collins has tested positive for COVID-19 and is currently experiencing mild symptoms.  The Senator will isolate and work remotely in accordance with CDC guidelines.
1475184357363040256	@TheRogue_Elf @thehill I am more interested in knowing how many are hospitalized because of COVID vs. those discovered to have COVID after being hospitalized for another condition.
1552525638182940672	called off for a week and told them i was tested positive on covid 😭 even though i got better in less than 3 days wtf they gon do ab it anyways
1436133909884911629	Eh... So people in other companies above and below my office floor are positive COVID, on  the day when my team had to work in office. So now we have to do self test every 2 days. NotLikeThis...
1522571119924224000	So one of my kindergarten kids had a positive covid test, boss won't tell me who. Could be the kid I hugged when she bumped her head yesterday. Yay.
1477373842993651715	I get noticed more with a positive Covid Test then my podcasts pmsl wtf going on. ❤️ Love you guys ❤️ 😂😂😂
1489265601386360832	@19_mo_86 @DrArwady yeah, I know a man who was vaxxed, preparing for the booster 3 days away he got covid, anyway, spent 9 days in the hospital, the first 4 days wasn't sure if he would even make it, but he did and still very very weak from it. So, vaccines don't always work!
1413588586499293192	Covid is getting a little too close to home again, walked past a house at the bottom of my road to see an ambulance &amp; people doing a covid test which was positive &amp; were struggling finding a ward that could give her a bed. She was baffled as to why she had it #JohnsonVariant
1428870851387088898	Another email about a positive covid test at kipp. I’m home schooling my kids. Fuck it. I’m not even playing.
1336452410814967814	@melindagates Advice???? I hv a severe allergic reaction to flu shot (irregular heart rate of almost 200 beats a minute.) Last time it lasted a week/24/7 non stop &amp; I ended up in the emergency room. I’m afraid the #COVID19 vaccine will do the same as full side effects r unknown. What do I do?
1393611975964479489	I knew some of you hoes won't shit after Trey had tested positive for covid and he was spitting all in yall mouths I ain't forget 🤣🤮 no amount of money will have me doing no shit like that. And I'm crazy about Tremaine !
1576729904825016320	I apparently don’t know my limits. I am feeling quite depleted today for some reason. I feel like I need to sit today out. I had to find the lab for the husband to have the pre op CoVid test. Tomorrow he is to go to hospital for pre op blood test and EKG. Tuesday, eye surgery.
1481801590168240128	i don’t understand the ppl saying the vaccine is useless bc i still got sick when i got covid. do yall not realize i could’ve prob ended up in the hospital in a condition much worse than i experienced 🙃 im glad i was able to be sick in the comfort of my home yall crazy lol
1567242436707074052	@serenais_eu We can get them if they're available, but sadly, Texas doesn't believe Covid exists so it's hard to find open places. But the instructions on this test do say even a faint line means positive so I'll have to retest in a few days :(.
1475612699530870786	@AndreiCrumb @BretWeinstein Hmmmm… let me try one on for size. Many people that have been “boosted” have tested positive for COVID. It is inconclusive if the vaccine even mitigates omicron variant at all.
1511789677514309643	In the space of 3 days, pretty much 1/4 of our work team tested positive for COVID and I’ve done so many lateral flow tests that I gave myself a nosebleed. Is this week nearly over?
1576083604035104768	"@katiegibbs So, you were masked, and I assume vaxxed and boosted, got COVID, but are blaming it on ""someone"" who wasn't wearing a mask? Did you see someone that wasn't wearing a mask? Can you confirm that this person was actually the reason you tested positive?"
1425914926783078404	@dianaberrent It is like this throughout the country. I am still on the wait list for the Long Covid clinic here. My oncologist was baffled when he diagnosed me with Diabetic Gastroparesis. It is quite obvious I have diabetes from Long Covid. There is not enough @CDCgov guidance for doctors.
1580294442606505984	@bloodyshinners @ih8evrybdy @Toibin1 You really are a subservient weakling aren't you. I wonder who does your thinking for you did the TV box tell you nobody gets covid in hospital 😝😝😝😝😝... I suppose you can just mutter under you mask and hope people can't hear your stupidity 👍
1510268953557303299	@wildplumbay @larue3000 @CTVNews Shoot well I must be special. I got covid unvaxxed. I enjoyed a week on the couch eating soup and taking extra herbal medicines. No hospital. Last time I checked the stats its mostly vaccinated people in hospital in Canada.
1418033892582383617	@Traceys_2cents @Brook22509241 @Breaking911 I go to a salsa class and a few months ago 15ppl tested positive, they temporarily closed up and later everything was up n running, so I was in a small room with them and never got sick. I haven’t been sick since last year when I first got covid, feet like a flu with taste loss
1368083466764640256	I am out of quarantine after 2 weeks due to covid. I also have pneumonia. Im off to the hospital today for my follow upi wear masks/sanitize my groceries:/don't social gather etcToo many are ignoring symptoms. wear masks, get tested if you have EVEN a cold, get the vaccine https://t.co/7zkF3PCh44
1481286002438291462	@michaelbd My wife's also an L&amp;D nurse. Her hospital's Covid policies:Covid+ patients must be isolated for 14 days after their positive test.But Covid+ nurses must be put on sick leave for only 5 days after their positive test.Apparently the virus takes it easy on nurses.
1471240275427160065	Imagine going in the hospital for cancer or a heart attack and they give you COVID! I don't want medical care from someone who gets treatment advice from Facebook. Some hospitals cancel worker vaccine requirements with Biden rule tied up in courts  https://t.co/QUBhoBHraT
1485792465458122752	@AgentTinsley I’m going to be @xbox cloud gaming a lot over the next few days. I think that’s the only video gaming I can sneak in to the hospital. COVID rules are strict right now

1479572077405343746	@swooper74 @JasinBlazin @nationalpost Yes I think that they told everyone they would keep you from getting Covid and ending up in hospital and you seatbelt comparison is ridiculous https://t.co/WPF5JWOyda
1584645749966778369	I tested positive for COVID last night and couldn't go out to vote. Massive shout out to a community member who jumped through bureaucratic hoops to proxy vote on my behalf.#OttawaVotes #ottawa #ottawaelection #catherinemckenney #mayor #McKenneyForMayor @cmckenney
1376965866013798408	I’m tired of hearing about this stupid ass anti-maskers and fucking anti-vaxers. Y’all need to take this shit more seriously my whole family has been sick as fuck with Covid for over three weeks. My pops is back in the hospital again. Just wear the damn mask
1385811617858863104	@bornfreeonekiss Happy weekend for you JJ 👐❤❤❤There are now curfews in Germany!😳 Like in war. I still don't know anyone who was in hospital because of Corona or who died from it. Strange isn't it? Since it's supposed to be a great pandemic😈 Big kiss to you JJ😚😉❤❤❤ https://t.co/1iwYnhaeOT
1394381887150383107	ok boys heading off twitter for a covid test i tested positive the first test:( hope i test negative this time
1607515966895980544	@windflower777 I do watch my health all the time. In September I went to visit family by plane. On the return trip I picked up the pneumonia virus and spent 6 days in the hospital. I had to give up my bed as the hospitals are over flowing: Covid, Flu &amp; RSV.
1473853783490940930	@NoahJ456 Hopefully it stays negative. I just had a positive COVID test come back today. My family is also getting sick now too. Thankfully we had the vaccine so we’re doing ok actually
1451920846981931009	I am blown away by people! You tweet about someone in hospital with Covid whos double jabbed it gets called bullshit, you tweet an elderly man is in hospital dying of cancer alone with nothing it gets called bullshit🙄 people are cruel &amp; have an agenda of their own now. Dangerous
1476755519700353024	After the year that I've had, I just found out that I tested positive for Covid 19 “I need everyone in my corner right now if you don't believe in me then I don’t want you on my team.  I am going to beat this.”
1474057545165717512	Just tested positive for #Covid Basically a mild cold/flu. Not worth shutting the country down for. The lockdowns have been much more detrimental for my health. #NoMoreLockdowns
1474120824915435520	Got a COVID test just to be safe, if it comes back positive I won’t be able to go to LMBM
1395286767721492487	@Prof_Marciniak Up until last month I had a contract to test work surfaces for Covid on a busy construction site. I tested lift call buttons every month and didn't get a positive at all. TBF they did have a strict cleaning regime in place though.
1382554891332284419	@jackieaina Please BOOST🙏🏻 3 years ago I was diagnosed with HIV I was a stripper, I haven't been able to work anymore. I can't risk having covid19, that would be deadly for me. PLEASE SOMEONE HELP. I run out of groceries and need some medshttps://t.co/yDfHSr8B5R    $V3D2Love

1512745655726489603	Well after 2+ years of being courted by #COVID, it finally got me. I tested positive a few days ago. I’m sure that if I wasn’t vaccinated and boosted, I could have been a lot worse. Make sure you’re vaccinated! Hopefully I will be back in action next week for the #Easter Triduum https://t.co/2PcTFkiyF0
1416092451765321728	My gardener didn't come yesterday, his day. He didn't say Covid, but he went to the hospital and his doctor said take 2-3 weeks off. I told him I'd pay for the time. Why do I--comfortable; not rich--say this? To encourage all businesses, big and small, to do the same.@lara_lazar
1384797703197057024	@DrJohnEGibson Definitely- if you’ve got normal or near normal lungs then most vents will be fine, but for anyone with severe lung injury the decades of engineering experience than have gone into ICU vent design make a huge difference. I think before COVID we mostly took this for granted.
1384928828737429507	Meah’s school has been in person for ONE week and I already got an email that someone there tested positive for COVID 🤦🏼‍♀️ Exactly why she is still doing distance learning
1427883649265897474	I just want to say that vaccines work.Our family is currently on lockdown until the 20th after being exposed to an individual who tested positive for Covid.The individual is currently at an isolation facility, rendering a few more days in quarantine.Our household is
1528092859873775617	@Scott_755 I’m wearing a mask still but 90% of my kids aren’t. I hadn’t been sick since March 2020 but I’ve been consistently sick since the kids stopped wearing masks. Triple vaxxed and have never tested positive for Covid despite my class of 20 all having had it. Hoping the illnesses stop
1403645519293992960	@Holbornlolz Mate there are more hospitals than there are people in hospital because of Covid. I know you're trolling but still
1614768919755247616	@gregggonsalves @DrLeanaWenMD @washingtonpost @ShiraDoronMD I really don't understand what your problem is with these two women?When was the last time you treated a patient?  Either with or for Covid?  What they say in their article is reflective of what I see in the hospital every shift I work.
1478032417407610884	At my job, 27 people tested positive for covid over the last week
1527312292974514176	Well I didn’t stream Tuesday or last night because I’m sick. Got my covid test results and it’s positive. So yeah… wish me luck
1485268878124937218	@kimak Oh no! I hope it’s not covid! Thanks! I hope it gets better soon too! I know it definitely could be worse, my asthma so far has been fine. So I’m just thankful I haven’t needed to go to the hospital for help with breathing.
1413873902317604865	@Russell81325113 @EssexPR I’ve haven’t had a vaccine, won’t have a vaccine, had covid and only lost my taste, you can’t say that your vaccine is the reason you had mild symptoms. Data coming through is that over 40% of people in hospital are fully vaccinated, go figure that out. It’s over let’s get on!
1478428399810928642	Well, I just tested positive for Covid…Fuck.
1376239207375573000	@MorticiaErotica my bf was hospitalized after getting his 2nd shot, and the doctor told us that, generally, the worse your case of covid was, the worse your reaction to the shot will be. people who never had it are usually fine. I had a pretty mild case and felt awful after both shots
1470012277206175754	@SJMelniszyn My first trip to the ER with Covid, I was told by the Dr that there was no treatment for Covid. He sent me home on oxygen. When my O2 dropped even more the next day, I was finally admitted. I was given Ivermectin by the internist. The ER Dr was dealt with.
1382070343154634755	@DrTomFrieden Got over a very scary morning.  Hubby got a call that his supervisor tested positive thru contact tracing.  Immediately got our Covid test, thank God it’s negative.  I had my 2nd shot last Saturday.  Hubby will have his at the end of the week.
1391005997712412672	@JackPosobiec I tested positive for Covid 2 days ago. It’s like a bad flu and I’m already feeling a little better. They can shove that needle where the sun don’t shine.
1382194625394319360	I was supposed to have knee surgery tomorrow but tested positive for Covid yesterday.A second rapid test also was positive.I had my second vaccine in March. Today I had the PCR saliva test. If it comes back positive also I’ll be considered a “breakthrough“.I have no symptoms.
1374110994423775233	@alex_kirshner @jessicawluther I think he's saying college basketball players who test positive for covid should get deported. Yikes @TimBrando that's rough
1479666822232244225	1/4 *Friday night scream into void* A week ago w a cough I tested negative for covid. Then, Sunday night I had zero energy and felt gross so I got a PCR. Anyway here I am 5 days later finally getting my results back letting me know that my sample was Positive and I have covid… https://t.co/23seyJNJLE
1424675327134085123	@ronan_glynn It seems that the vaccine doesn't work. There are several people near me who like me have the double vaccine but they also have covid and a couple of them are very ill in hospital. So why isn't the vaccine working?
1613377872751919104	Today I experienced my first case of Long Covid of the Heart in Cuba at the Peds Hospital William Soler. 15 y/o female Pt came in to the ER presenting with chest pain, tachycardia, hypotension and disautonomia. Past pertinent history of SARS Covid 2 about 2 years ago.

Feel terrible for those who live here and can’t get a vaccine. Zika, possibly is the next topic? I’m in hospital now with those dying from COVID, I’m concerned.
1473685923007188998	Tested positive for COVID yesterday and felt like death. Before I went to bed I listened to 2 hours of Rihanna. Woke up feeling amazing. I believe there is a direct correlation.
1471847782675894277	@PKendrickWIG Good inside information tells me 5 Oxford players tested positive for covid now 😮‍💨
1378977089240625152	To add on, as someone in my household tested positive for Covid. Somehow thankfully to the safety measures I've enacted at home, I got a negative result. Masking and sanitizing can save you!!!
1475351611702579203	2.3% off 322,000 greater Newcastle population covid positive… unacceptable The other 97.7% can’t get results or get tested This is now life in Australia The tested versus the untested Results versus waiting an eternity@BradHazzard @NSWCHO enjoying Xmas? I’m in iso 5 days
1469843824012926976	@WhaleKila I live in a city of 800,000 people where 37,000 people had tested positive  (4.6%).Yes, we have herd immunity. It's from our high vaccine rate. That was my point.That's why we expect Covid won't be a worse burden than a typical flu year
1383047302118567936	I think it’s time for health care pros to use stronger language &amp; describe exactly what happens when you have to be admitted to hospital for Covid. Tell them what 5 iv’s look &amp; feel like. What’s it like to be catheterized because your bladder doesn’t work. #onpoli
1501332726439452673	@gilly3536 I agree. I've just had a look for posts and there are quite a few who are against her. But, I think it's mostly because she had tested positive with COVID a few weeks ago. Anyway, this is the search that I found:https://t.co/Qt0brZAwv8
1471974076805693445	@KeithBu83058454 @bombdiggity1983 @tom_koopmans @Night_b_Jasmine Are you insane? Currently my dil has COVID and is fully vaccinated with Pfizer. Probably going to end up hospitalized. Keep believing it works.
1426141213325815811	I just wanna rant &amp; rant about what is happening in our country. Mortality in COVID is shifting to children. Cases are going up, and cases of patients less than 17yrs old are getting hospitalized. Its a neverending cycle of pain...
1437900471549800455	Covid test came back Negative! WOW! So @carmentickal was positive and me Negative. We were at the same places in the last 2-3 weeks.  Wonder how i did NOT get it! Still Thankful hers was a mild case due to we BOTH had #CovidVaccine #vaccine #GetVaccinated people!
1375558802045538316	I was working security for a local hospital and dealing with the after math of it. Ice box fill up 30/40 a day. Plus 10/15 more in the cooler down stairs. Then I got covid. Bad one step from being in icu and vent
1382953238530445313	I got my first Covid vaccine today! I also had tested Covid positive back in December after Christmas. I’m currently experiencing some side effects from the vaccine (I got the Moderna one) but I can promise you this, the side effects are much milder then having the virus itself.
1386100585456291841	Fuck wsfcs! I'm most likely gonna test positive for Covid! Tf were they thinkin opening up schools! I feel like ass! I had a good run sick free smh 😭
1502161664271331330	@greeniememes we are officially covid twins. i tested positive like an hour ago after seeing ur post about it. lowkey inspired me to do a test.
1437965059007950856	@RepublicanCat I work at a nursing home and there are residents there who have tested positive in January and August. Both of those times, the residents never had any reaction to COVID, were never hospitalized, &amp; and haven't died of it. Thankfully they didn't suffer at all from it. ❤

1372679469308252160	@MycroftRick @milli_vanillii 90% of the ppl that tested positive for Covid admitted that they are avid sheep.... I mean mask wearers. Just more evidence that the godvernment that’s been lying for hundreds of years is still up to the same thing, lying to keep the ppl under control.
1537885561578344450	@lunarmeadow_ Yeah, but sometimes other BS just happens. Was hospitalized twice for it, once during a heatwave and the second time when I had covid.
1470432082002423810	@Sskrr93 @JayBeyonshire @AlexChapmam3210 @pcrritesgood @MaximeBernier Why would you need me to tell you to go to the hospital when I have a heart attack if you're not infected with a bad case of Covid?Are you just going to say hi or something?Man you're absolutely NOT smart are you?
1472045904253304837	@RevLaurieinLex My parish sent an email that someone attending on Sunday has tested positive for COVID. People took their masks off at the communion rail. I look at different online worship services. So many people have gotten lax. One choir had 2 vocalists and organist not masked.

1466065837442412555	Was told my student was tested positive with COVID. 😐😐 principal says no need to quarantine she’s been out of school since before thanksgiving. How about she’s been around me and my other students and I’ve been around my kids and my family. I’m so over this shit. 🤬😠🤬
1474966948790386688	Unfortunately I took at home Covid test and tested positive :( . Stay safe y’all. I really thought it was just allergies. No fever or anything. On that note, I’m really looking forward to gaming and streaming. I rarely leave the house and don’t plan to forever now 😭
1457349776836644867	@ichudov My point is yes, you can get COVID and still infect others while vaccinated BUT they are not being hospitalized or dying at the rates  before a vaccine came to be.
1428905954855116804	@BrandonPrust8 Would you sign skmethjng that says if you’re get covid you don’t go to hospital for treatment. If yes. Then carry on. I can respect that! If not. Then wtf are we talking about here?
1505803452756205573	soo i tested positive for covidi guess that explains why i've been feeling like shit these past few daysthroat hurts, nose is runny, headaches
1501707350423470081	@JessicaGoedtel My boyfriend got covid a month ago and he tested positive on his second day of symptoms- as soon as he got a fever. There's a lot of variation! I'm so sorry you got it, feel better soon

1475608720847642628	I really think I'm immune to covid I have not had covid this entire pandemic.. Every time I been around somebody who had covid I quarantined STILL and still never tested positive!
1454084018379628549	Everyone piling on @OwenJones84 coz he's dissing @Keir_Starmer? Really? I don't always agree with Jones (see, us on the left can differ too!) but can you tell me anything positive Starmer has brought to the @UKLabour Party apart from his last Covid test?
1443994751892537345	@taraanne2513 @Richard_On @marcroberge Since Mike tested positive for Covid on Sunday and I tested negative but we both have been so sick, I have really loved watching all the videos and pictures that you text me Tara Anne and the ones posted on FB. Enjoy tonight, everyone! Wish I was there!
1380486456997773315	Mum died 2 weeks ago. I had a positive Covid test Tuesday. You could say it’s a shit time.
1478425473461981188	@sarah7memexxx @chrischirp Positivity rate indicates the percentage of tests taken that gave a positive result. It's a useful indicator for the current Covid situation, i.e. high positivity rate indicates real positive case number is likely higher (many missed cases, bottleneck at test availability). 1/2
1379299294168109062	@drdrew I’d feel great about contributing to our collective wellbeing by not spreading disease. What’s your point? BTW, I’m a real MD who’s treated Covid in the ER from the start.
1483664210764570626	@Rooshaan12 @nathanTbernard I never said it did. If the statement doesn’t apply to you then you don’t have to reply back. I’m speaking of the massive corruption in the U.S. where Covid cases and deaths are massively inflated and false. Someone could die in a car accident in the U.S. but test positive /1
1483690881454854145	@NTFTWT I was (mostly) asymptomatic and then tested positive on the 1st of Jan - my state (in Australia) had covid 0 for years and suddenly we had 20k a day. Our previous highest was 70. Fortunately me and my family all recovered well
1481169183576576001	@knoller2 @Carl_M79 If they had just a cold then a test wouldn't show positive lol come on lad it isnt rocket science. I've had covid and the flu and guess which showed a positive and which didn't?
1509718832700612616	@2021Mamabear123 @calphonso Just how many children are hospitalized with covid, per 100,000?  Now give me the figure for 2019 for flu. Give me the statistic, please.I'll wait.
1460587412673945603	@BioTurboNick This is heartbreaking!!!! I feel for her so much!!! I am extremely cautious with covid and my #1 fear for myself and my kids is exactly this, we're vaxed and likely wouldn't be hospitalized, but what this woman is going through sounds like hell to me.
1478023021973540866	I really had a dream where I took 4 covid test and all were positive, I hate this timeline
1444025244486967300	Having three positive lateral flow tests, no taste or smell and feel like I’ve been hit by a bus and I’m sat here waiting for my PCR test results to come back like they are going to say something different😂 cannot believe I got Covid the day before I was going to Manchester🥺
1372254214504730624	tested positive for covid today even tho i got my first vaccine 2 weeks ago 😞😞
1425777726162710531	@happiblnde @Angelasfreenews All of the above. I had to help assist with our covid clinic came in contact with over 10,000+ people a week in line to get their shot and never tested positive or had a symptom not to mention the vaccine. Something is not right.
1501879023869337603	@technollama Mild infections caused by Omicron is a bit of a myth, I think. I know a number of people who tested positive more than 10 days and have a long convalescence with ups and downs. Covid 19 remains a dangerous disease for many, despite the vaccinations
1386387549275426830	@adx599 @KeepItDownNews @JamesMelville This is not what I said...I was referring to serious COVID in respect to ‘in hospital’ - not cases caught there...
1461403006033969156	@GovAbbott  A kid came to my dgt's class sick on M &amp; tested positive for Covid. The teacher &amp; other 22 kids in the class have to be tested. You're an ass &amp; I wish you as miserable a Thanksg. as our fam &amp; the other 22 will have not knowing if theirs will test positive too. https://t.co/WGecqJxzKK
1433885297054560257	"@kanesays23 @OscarDeLaHoya Are you crazy? ""Get vaccinated! I mean you might still end up in the hospital with Covid too just like me but get vaccinated anyway!"" C'mon man, this is the last person you want telling people to get vaxxed."
1501640118058291202	@notasoreloser @Race_Warrior_ @FormerAntivax This is drivel. I never said PCR tests came back positive for Covid when someone tested really had a cold
1601366555878912001	Been sick the last 2 weeks. Today I finally went to get tested for flu. Tested positive for Covid :c
1415994356004233217	Just back from the market, one of my usual sellers not there. I asked his mate where he was, he's off with Covid, tested positive in the week.He had told me he had his second jab about a month ago. This is all true, fact check it all you like Tw1tter.
1384142233541091335	@RoadMN @brianstelter @CNN I’m confused... Democrats who overwhelmingly trust CNN for their COVID information, believe that between 30-50% of people who get covid will need to be hospitalized. The actual number is between 3-5%. How did they come to be so badly misinformed if they’re watching CNN?
1376738716484427781	@zeynepyenisey You shouldn’t. I’m 63, got Covid (self diagnosed—no test), recovered, lost most of my sense of taste + smell for ~2 mos &amp; find NO REASON for ANYONE to get the jab. It’s ludicrous. Protect the vulnerable, expose the rest, develop natural herd immunity. That’s how it works!
1487234935379226625	My covid test came back positive today and i am doing my best to keep calm and stay optimistic. Vaccinated but no booster yet
1344405521001017344	As I have said, just because you're vaccinated doesn't mean you cannot get the virus. Or won't be contagious. It ONLY means YOU may not wind up in hospital. We'll still be masking, distancing and washing for some time.#covid #vaccine #virus #contagioushttps://t.co/EDBJ5uNTVI
1549887956906692609	@siddharth3 So true. There also send to be a stigma against testing positive and reluctance to actually test. Lots of ’viral’ going around but it is not Covid. You don’t need to test, I already know it is going to be negative. 3 hours before the test was positive 🙂
1440301648685899785	ONE OF MY CLASSMATES WHO SITS INFRONT OF ME TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVID??? HELP????
1376801514451169281	@Sherriqotu No, not covid related. I just went to bed the night of the 11th, and woke up in ICU w my hands tied down so I wouldn’t try to pull my ET tube out, and realizing I was in deep trouble, but I was comatose for a long time. I’m sorry. What is MSOF?
1430263954169733120	@fight4freedom87 @Clover_Jane84 @TwoSockTwin @MattGertz Soooo children with RSV test positive for covid? I did not know that. Thanks for enlightening me.
1445408046767816710	#Singapore's #COVID19 surge continues: record number of new cases, 9 deaths.The serious cases are far disproportionately among the unvaccinated.Still no figures (so far as I can tell) of how many of the non-hospitalized cases are #vaccinated vs unvaxxed.
1601590051942506496	@ucf17rj I was lazy and procrastinating on getting vaxxed. I believed in the science, I just thought of covid like a bad flu and I never get flu shots. Figured I’d be fine even if I got it. Then I got it august last year and ended up in the ER coughing up blood. Felt like death.
1479929101737619457	@DoctorKarl can anyone you know explain the algorithm for new cases of covid? how does it know I'm a new case or another test , or if i was positive then negative, the caught it again? As an IT person I'm becoming more convinced each day is simply positive tests not brand new.?
1482055216203767811	@BorisJohnson Where r u? I'm a teacher. If I'm in contact with a positive case of Covid as long as I test negative on a LFT I'm fine. Why not for you?  Don't suppose you will read this. Your ego 2 big.
1448282803456524288	@garybryanshow Wow. I didn’t know he was that sick with it. Thank God he made it! I feel fortunate I came through it as well as I did and was never hospitalized except in the ER for 12 hours to get monoclonal antibody treatment. Even so, I was still sick for 6 weeks. Covid is no joke!!
1386700394856783883	I was watching Twilight the night I had body aches, felt feverish and cold. Next day I got diagnosed with COVID 19It spreads by watching Twilight guys! Viber do your thing please, everyone should know thischz
1597930660098117632	@Equinox_Eve I could certainly do with that little kiss today😌, just tested positive for covid😒…So yay for feeling like crap and being on sick pay for the next few days🥳😐😂.Hope you have a great day today Eve😘🙂. https://t.co/rtn7v7nyDK
1481604527581437952	"@1EEX303 @DerrickBrunton2 @shane_stiles67 ""Of the 22 people who died; 14 were vaccinated and eight were not vaccinated."" - NSW 12 Jan 2022.I've heard stats like this in the last few months. Unvaccinated person can die from cancer but if tested positive for covid within 28 days it's a covid death."
1564330550537719809	@cumbriaoldrural That’s what the nurse said to me 2 years ago when I had to have a covid test the night I was admitted to hospital with heart failure Xxx
1537819803888533507	A few weeks ago, I’m convinced I had Covid, had all the symptoms but never actually tested positive. I was told this can happen. I want to get my antibodies tested to possibly confirm but am I wasting my time since I’m vaxxed &amp; boosted? @DrEricDing
1579031603904679936	#evusheld #evusheld4theuk My partner,my caregiver my world, an essential worker through the whole pandemic has tested positive for Covid 😌I hope I haven’t got it too 😬 now I’m reliant on kindness of neighbours to help me.Please give us Evusheld and our lives back please 🙏 😢
1381527926252957696	"@KingStreetKing I'd say ""Hey,I just tested positive for stage 3 covid. I'm highly infectious and masked for your protection. But I need a hug more than a mask,will you hug me?"" Then I'd walk toward him,reaching for him with one hand while reaching for my mask with the other. Watch Clem run."

1329781660410372106	I will fight tooth and nail before they give me this poison. I’m convinced that BAME people are more likely to die as a result of COVID-19 is that they receive inferior treatment in hospital. But now the government will insist that BAME people are the first to get this vaccine.
1453759283674423298	@GregMulholland1 Nearly everyone I speak to gets a positive test a few days after the jabs. You haven’t got covid Greg, if you’ve had the Pfizer it’ll be spike protein. Wish you well anyway.
1472686001680261125	Wanted to go to ‘tid the season so bad, but after seeing how many people god covid from it, I’m so glad I didn’t. I couldn’t imagine not spending the holidays with my family because of a concert. I hope all of you that tested positive have a super quick recovery 💕
1415363928952123402	@RVAwonk I got covid in dec 2020 spent 5 days in the hospital. When I left I had lost my balance and couldn't walk without help of a walker. I also had lung damage and gad to start using an asthma inhaler,I'd never used. Because of the steroids in asthma medicine I developed cataracts.
1442954960015003656	@DrunkB0b @cspanwj @1a @OnPointRadio So I Presume U had BOTH a Positive #Covid Test AND a recent blood test showing U still have effective antibodies?Don’t risk it, #GetVaccinated !who is getting ill now proves I’m right; #vaccines work
1435003315486609410	Think the pandemic is over? A local restaurant that re-opened made these two girls share a cup. Now they both have covid and are in the hospital?Don’t believe me? Google search 2 Girls 1 Cup for all the details#COVID19 #pandemic #2girls #WearAMask
1425512731906613249	It’s extremely small numbers compared the now 9.5 million fully vaccinated people. New data set, and from what I can see it’s several days worth added in all at once?And still over 99% of fully vaccinated people haven’t even tested positive for covid….much less gotten sick.
1530744258142932992	HOW DID I JUST TEST POSITIVE FOR COVID FOR THE SECOND TIME!? I didn’t even go to edc all I’ve been doing is working 🥲🥲🥲🥲
1439639317362528264	@SmilinJack2099 …heh…9/11, after a day of drinking, someone posts a story about an anti-vax imbecile who'd been coughing on people, and wound up in the hospital with Covid…I wished her an early demise &amp; got booted... she wound up dying-- seems like they could've given me time off for that!…
1380189867473215489	@osrey35 I tested positive for Covid
1432233238739701761	@JamieCapullo @GregCapullo Or if you could sell me a little drawing of GregI guess it's too much to askI work in health, in the ICU covid of my hospital and drawing and reading comics is my hobby. I love his art and I would love to have an original drawing of him. I hope you can read me. https://t.co/JaOq6XQ3Oa
1423151617000493058	@kel2780 I’m a huge FOB fan, heard one of the band got tested positive for covid. The European tour was cancelled because of covid.
1439629201821208578	@clariss55827655 @AdrianneA380 This is the data I need too being hospitalized for almost 3 weeks w Covid Pneumonia &amp; blood clots on my lungs. I feel like I have to believe in my immunity system. I get there are other variants out there but isn't that what our immune system are about? Idk!
1377416366941040641	@destinysangl84 @tjennifer888 Hang in there. Getting my second on Tuesday.  Spent a week in January in the hospital with Covid. Have me blood clots.
1516537272941920257	I tested positive for Covid today and it is quite miserable! Thankfully I’m on spring break and can rest this week 🥲 I have never wanted to drink so much Gatorade and tea before today
1438236044244123653	@jenndb891 @Theoneoneone11 @ctvedmonton Exactly my point, people have had their chance to get the vaccine. So if you didn’t get it and ended up getting the worst of the covid virus and ended up in the hospital, who’s fault is that? Time to open up the world. Can’t coddle all the people not wanting to get vaccinated.
1482539976826966017	@alcharalambous With covid anything less than death is considered mild. This infuriates me. My wife had mild covid in April and was hospitalized and to say our lives have been anything less than hell would be an understatement.
1449376565817643008	Tested positive for covid and I’d still rather do anything else than watch tonight’s card @danawhite 🖕😭🖕
1450477042957434887	Me receiving my positive covid test: maybe they mean we’re POSITIVE you don’t have covid…
1509314399487418370	@BlocksSega It's probably covid.  Could easily be a mild flu as well.My covid gave me a false negative test in the beginning.  2nd test was positive.Ironically the cold I had 4 months later was worse.
1480002204182396930	@BNODesk I dead never thought Id have to do this.. But I'm currently 90 days Sober and recently just started paying rent to be in a halfway.. I just tested positive for COVID yesterday &amp; now I have to miss 2 week's worth of work.. Pleaseee donate if you can &amp; b00$t https://t.co/XDCp6lM97r https://t.co/dBmV2Jku2N
1387408521956896773	@IAMChrisEdward @sharkow53 I’m pretty sure I had it the first week of March last year. Vomiting, diarrhea, fever of 106. Went to the hospital from dehydration asked them if it was Covid and they waved it off. 2 days later I was hospitalized with stroke like symptoms. I’m thankful for the vaccination
1587488374448848898	@DeeganTim @BillKristol I dare you to say that to my nurse face that took care of plenty of people who died from covid or to any person who lost a loved one from covid. I guess the next pandemic or if you get sick don't bother going to the hospital. You are a sad, little person. I pray for your soul
1573638990468710405	#covid Have I been on another planet or burying my head? I have just realised that anyone you are near to could have Covid as you don’t have to test or isolate anymoreNow I’m in hospital poorly - how do you get your head around that?Shall I become a hermit? https://t.co/nn3DUva6fx
1422908670468370433	@BenDoubtful @DRLDD @GovEvers Well when you get the delta variant. Remember I offer republican thoughts and prayers. You are part of the problem. Look who is in the hospital and who is doing from covid. It is the unvaccinated.
1466595441869422592	So thought of this the other day. What happens to these nurses that test for covid? I sincerely doubt they are being quarantined after every positive they find. So wtf are they doing?🤔
1516262764418723842	@AlaskaAirNews Gonna be pretty pi$$ed if my family catches Covid after we fly with you in a week.  Especially since we can't re-enter the States if we test positive. @AlaskaAir

1410586994703470595	@sirsarel @logicaldebate Plus NASREC is supposedly reopening next week.. That aside it's the pvt clinics shouldering the numbers.. And if I know certain family members, on hearing they have covid they'd insist on going to hospital irrespective...
1477784804095578116	@David_desJ @Zeke_Cohen I for one would suggest NOT filling up the ICU, as they're already stretched to the breaking point and there are other reasons to go to the ICU other than covid.
1485481483611607041	Everytime someone post a positive corona test and I only see the two lines instantly I think their pregnant lol idek why
1386687505836265474	When someone close has been diagnosed with Covid, I find that the world operates at a completely different pace and reality than everyone else.
1546437818939052035	Not the best start to the week. Home with JW who has tested positive for Covid. Mum is in hospital having an operation.I’m trying to keep busy making Makaton resources for school.
1430612729836998660	"I now have 2 kids, positive with Covid. Nevermind the ""when it rains, it pours"" quote. This is a fucking tsunami and a hurricane at the same time. And it's only Wednesday. I get tested tomorrow.#FuckCovid https://t.co/ytpADqnikr"
1382100542101544964	@politicocount1 @PoliticsForAlI @Telegraph That’s not quite right Ryan. I’ve always thought it’s the wrong way to calculate the deaths. It’s anyone with a positive covid test within 28 days. So a 62 year old dies of sudden heart attack or is knocked down on day 27. Nothing to do with covid but still counts in the stats.
1571003581305884676	@VUsuxballs @MrJimBuck @P_McCulloughMD I was hospitalized with Covid. I refused remdesivir or RunDeathIsNear, I never signed a waiver.

1373667754675421187	@hismoneytree @NHSuk Lol. Pure lies. I know many people who beleive they had covid at one point or another. Guess what? None of them were in ICU and are all healthy and alive.
1389251132686491654	Well some ass hole came to work with COVID last Wednesday and last night I felt like shit so I went and got tested today. I’m positive. I’m so frustrated. Two weeks out of work and now I gotta fight this thing. Awesome.
1374828848743780352	@numbers_truth I think its just the opposite. There is quite a bit of evidence that COVID deaths were over reported and deaths by lockdown under reported. Death WITH COVID should not be reported @foogatwo can show you NJ data that is backdated with no positive COVID test nor symptoms .
1427330328725708801	Every few weeks I have to go to the hospital to get my meds and they have a drive through Covid testing spot. Just a couple months ago there were no cars, but each time I go by it grows and grows. They are lined up. Get the damn vaccine and lets save lives and get back to normal.

Per the Pfizer study those who do poorly that took it test negatively for covid yet have covid like symptoms.
1561501589013086208	I’ve tested positive for COVID…
1550294064884588545	@CaptainVaxx @_miss__jay__ @hamill_law @BradSpellberg The LA County/USC physicians NEVER said a word against vaccines, &amp; they expressed skepticism about mask mandates one time (&amp; no one ever claimed they don't wear masks in the hospital.   The point, I think, is that they said definitively that serious COVID cases are NOT . . .
1343925494627135495	A family member has tested positive for COVID on 26/12/20. She had loss of smell &amp; taste. We are isolating. I had the 1st dose of the @pfizer vaccine on 17/12/20. I've had a cough, fever &amp; headaches for the last week. Dry cough just lingering now. I tested negative for COVID 🙌🏽
1488855677736992773	I interacted with 3 people in the last days who are now tested positive for corona and now I'm just praying that I don't have it because I really wanna avoid quarantine.
1553470986703384576	President Biden has tested positive for COVID again. I wish him a full and speedy recovery. Remember when this fool had to be rushed to the hospital for emergency therapy? I do! We will never forget his disregard for our citizens or our country. https://t.co/AMaKVYOcaS
1472534155313524738	@_molly_012 Yes! My 9 year old got covid back in september. She spent 14nights in hospital and is now relearning to walk again. She has NO covid antibodies, so we are walking around scared of what a reinfection will do to her.
1473974517882105858	Please get vaccinated. Unfortunately, I tested positive for COVID yesterday &amp; the Doctor told me my symptoms would have been way worse if I wasn’t vaccinated. Thankful, I only have a congestion, sore throat &amp; headaches.
1471198374250618893	It's been over 3 weeks since I tested positive for covid as a unjabbed 41 year old and I feel absolutely fine with just minor symptoms. Imagine how much better I would of been with the JAB. Yes, i wouldn't of known I had it, and would of spread it to everyone.
1391646742706151425	@priyankachopra My wife (27yrs)is critically ill and admitted in hospital (ICU) past 29 days due to serious infection which not related to Covid. On this situation,any contribution will help us fight the situation.Prayers and support is all we need🙏🏻 https://t.co/YTU2tXRHyU
1430635507231428612	@mdurbz75 @JoeOrion5 @No2Gray Total admissions don't reflect which people are diagnosed with covid and which of those are unvaxxed. I have loved ones who have family members with cancer waiting for a hospital bed, but they're filled up with unvaccinated assholes who thought they knew better.
1474212151472574477	@wfhealthins @angiejo920 @deadandcompany @playthesand @nugsnet I've just read there are people who have tested positive for Covid and are in quarantine at the resort PITS is at, how have you not canceled/postponed? You're putting people at risk. Yes personal responsibility but have some empathy, people over money
1469019458027069441	Have tested positive for #COVID19 bit of a surprise after negative LFTs earlier this week and even today just before PCR result arrived. Got a lot of anxiety about little A catching it so I hope she’ll be ok and v sad not to be heading home to see family this weekend 😢
1380329246070046721	@FOX2News So,got terribly ill bc she ignored her covid symptoms for TEN days before informing her physician?! Now we have to hear how “courageous” she was when in the hospital due to noncompliance. I’m happy she’s ok, but maybe she wouldn’t have been so sick had she seen her dr earlier? 🤷‍♀️
1429207296186388484	@US_FDA This is also hilarious ivermectin has had more studies than the Covid vaccine and been proven to work not to mention I got Covid 18 days ago after being diagnosed I heard about ivermectin I took it and within two days I had no symptoms and was 100% so call me a jackass 🙄
1476077741581561863	i'm on day 9 of quarantining &amp; day 6 of infection and i still tested positive on a rapid test today indicating that i am still shedding virus &amp; am infectious. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR HOUSE AFTER 5 DAYS IF YOU HAVE COVID.
1372660700984786951	@robsolonhamer @tomselliott I’m watching your president ignoring the border crisis. He is releasing Covid positive illegals into America but if you fly into America you need a Covid test. These people are being trafficked to the US if they can’t keep up they’re left to die. Girls are raped &amp; killed.........
1405376497137848323	I pray for whoever tested positive covid can do this and fight. Please take the vaccines while you can. It helps us end this pandemic and we can live our life back to normal.
1478112754305273859	@CP24 There are 1,232 hospitalized with COVID in Ontario - a province that has 371 hospitals. That works out to an average of 3.32 patients per hospital.I’m having trouble understanding the “high numbers of patients” part of this?
1545314256412893184	Hope you will start to feel better soon.. I also had the 3 series shots and over 2 years no Covid.. A month ago I was tested positive for Covid.. It was pretty rough for me. Mostly very fatigued feeling..💗💗
1369760015419072513	".@SenRonJohnson tells me he doesn't believe he needs the vaccine since he already was diagnosed with COVID-19 last fall. ""No I had COVID, so I don’t believe...I think that probably provides me the best immunity possible actually having the disease.” https://t.co/6VtbbXcsVW"
1572051589807972353	@gov_fails @MerianneJensen Same. Among pretty much everyone I know, all got covid and none had long covid. One lost sense of smell but they didn't call it long covid. They called it covid with lost sense of smell but otherwise fine except the positive test keeping them out of work.
1420261420986298371	"@GeraldoRivera Actually, it's not ""the world's best"".  #1 golfer Jon Rahm was forced to bail out because of stupid covid tests that don't fucking work!!!  His 3rd asymptomatic positive test in 5 months, and got the vaccine. Tell me how this shit is working?????"
1479918633472118789	hooray, negative COVID test! \o/ looking forward to being able to leave the house for things again.(i didn't have it -- but i was at a pub quiz Monday where someone tested positive, so i wanted to be careful, especially since going *anywhere* requires taking public buses.)
1429917419246522380	@GavinNewsom 1. Four of my family members got covid while having the Pfizer vaccine with severe symptoms and one going to the hospital. 2. The FDA has to approve it. How would it look to not approve a vaccine that millions of people have been taking.
1418306433460981764	If you don't get vaccinated why would you go to the hospital with Covid and trust those healthcare workers. They could put something in your IV to make you better and smarter.  🙄I just can't with these antiVax and Covid assholes anymore....
1467925877006737408	@Jeff_Erickson @SiriusXMFantasy it's a half PPR, I'm up 14 and opponent has Allen and Diggs, I need a miracle or a positive Covid test #chancestowin
1412508913778446339	@PBSherren My colleague, had covid last year, double vaccinated, got it again, still ill and off work and mightily p*ssed off after 4 weeks - not in hospital, so it’s fine, right?
1388649404421312520	I am grateful for the blessings that have allowed me to process #grief in a reasonably healthy way so I could draw Daddy out. He did not understand all that happened in the ICU. Daddy does not do well in hospitals. I had been the one doing 2x daily updates with nurses. #COVID19
1385454230052429826	Send good vibes our way please.. My girl Just tested positive for covid :(
1484227474049359884	well great,7 of 9 of my family members  today tested positive on COVID and I have not been feeleng well since yesterday. Also getting sick in the middle of my exam period is NOT ideal-I will go test myself tomorow/on monday(hopefully university will take this in to consideration
1484652145563639808	@Bacchyarts My boss tested positive so I have been hiding after my covid test
1480563611865079809	Unvaccinated family remember tested positive for Covid on Thursday. She recovered quickly. All her symptoms are gone now except for a bit of congestion. It took her 5 days to recover. She recovered faster than my vaccinated family members. Who would have thought.
1480047705455939585	Teachers at my school are testing positive for Covid left &amp; right. Was exposed all day Monday. My first PCR test just came back negative. Hopefully my second test comes back negative too 🤞🏽I feel like I’m a sitting duck just waiting to get Covid at school.
1381958878254993409	@jdtcnt hey would you guys be interested in the state willingly putting people at risk for covid? Eagan DPS exam station had 4 employees test positive for covid last week and is hiding it from the public, I have employees(multiple) that would confirm this 1/
1391176033127354371	That because those us who could have been diagnosed or were already diagnosed got pushed to the back of the line because the only thing that mattered was Covid patients.I haven't had a face to face meeting with my doctor since October of 2019.https://t.co/BuOEIjBTWO
1382545791869362176	@ndtv @pushpendrakum I m tested covid positive sir https://t.co/6BemPftZGa
1463324961280385026	Today is fucked. I went to cover a shift at a store today, found out the manager there tested positive for Covid. They closed the store down, I decided to go to my store and work because of a remodel we’re doing. I seriously wish this would all end 😭
1390285375814488066	It’s sickening that I’m still hearing stories of drs blowing off #LongCovid patients. And researchers are excluding people who didn’t have a positive Covid test. You can isolate in the analysis instead of excluding before the study starts. Unbelievable https://t.co/36DyRmrXgP
1595165252076900377	@FreyjaTarte I thought we found out the tests are not Covid specific? They test positive for cold and flu too. I say if you have a fever stay home.
1429535484074680322	@stevesilberman I teach with someone who went to the Alabama rally. I’m just waiting for her positive Covid test.
1550230079904645126	@wickedbtchofvt There’s only one person who we visited who tested positive but nobody knew I just rather never visit people but my man caters to his family (long story) but this is now our second time having Covid :))
1478482606551351296	@Montoya3Inigo @SacredDemand @HistoryBoomer Being unvaxxed makes you approx 40 to 60 times more likely to be hospitalized. Vaccination status is a MUCH larger factor im covid severity than being overweight. It's not even close.
1486360037396156419	@JedediahBila When I got Covid my primary care doctor said “we don’t treat Covid, if you can’t breath go to the ER”. Fortunately I am young, healthy and take many supplements each day. My symptoms weren’t more then a sore throat. But so many aren’t as lucky and treatments were suppressed
1428725664891375619	@Iamshanewilson 21 Covid patients in #alberta in the ICU? Nope, I don’t see that being a major issue at this time.  Do you think this number is worthy of reinstating #covid19 restrictions?
1479929144335028226	@carlyvl26 @Cyb3rTr1 @angrygypsy_ PRAYERS 🙏🙏🙏Was in the ER with another round of Covid and I have been fully vaxxed. 105.2 and they were going to tube me and I refused and once my temp dropped to 100 I told them I'm leaving. I'm home on my meds and fever is 98.2
1575979500571340800	my roommate who wasn’t allowed to leave work early is now developing symptoms at work lol we live in hell roommate who is already home w positive asymptomatic covid has a boyfriend who also tested positive for covid today https://t.co/IOZr0ugH9M
1426313254041751553	@BogochIsaac Saying that the vaccine will prevent healthcare workers from bringing the virus into the hospital is false. I took care of a Pfizer vaccinated RN who just got off the Night Shift and tested positive when she walked into my facility. Bilateral Covid pneumonia.
1431364096906174469	@ASlavitt Call me crazy but after my girlfriend got sick and tested positive for CoVid, I also got sick. Took some horse ivermectin and felt absolutely fine the morning after I woke up. 🤷‍♂️
1546534518009614338	If you all didnt know, I recently tested positive for covid after not having it for two years, my experience has been interesting to say the least. I havent been able to work or stream and it really sucks, I will be back soon ✨
1374286280733904901	@petetheblue @_eddyclinton All you do is get on your knees and basically worship Boris Johnson and that shitty world health organization. They count people down as Covid deaths if they die within 28 days of having a positive test. Somebody I know died on his motorcycle and it was counted as a Covid death.
1478189371018858496	@GovRonDeSantis are you an effing idiot? Your wife undergoing cancer treatment without a mask in public? I'm appalled as an ICU nurse having taken care of Covid pts in the ICU. I pray God helps her but also helps FL by removing you.
1448300277946220548	"@tomslick_wa @langetombee @ida_skibenes Oh, that CONFLICTING science. I seeWho is 8x likely to be hospitalized &amp; 18x more likely to die? Did u know that deaths ""from covid"" have ON AVERAGE 2-3 PRE-EXISTING conditions that contribute to death? So prove to me they actually died BECAUSE of covid. https://t.co/Um58nAh32K"
1472996453920428034	one of my classmates tested positive for covid🧍🏻‍♀️
1383775931936870420	@REALJEREMYLEE @tbone11193 @JaouAbd @BarbJG @ClayTravis Sounds like you are buying into the panic porn. Tell me, what are the chances of a healthy person going to the hospital bc of covid? Also a fun fact, explain how Florida and Texas are doing so well after restrictions were lifted?
1289147937981894658	I’m a nurse I only wear a  protective gear at work because it’s required. I do not wear anything in public  I eat healthy I refuse to receive the flu vaccine  I haven’t had flu in 7 years and have never tested positive for Covid19  I do get tested very often. You figure it out.
1523960793880051712	@therealmissjo Thanks to you😊&amp; others here, I learned early to be skeptical about the shots, so I don't get how anyone believes the latter. My husband &amp; I didn't get 💉, &amp; in Dec. '21 did get covid badly; he was in hospital 12 days. We used IVM, recovered fully, &amp; never regretted our decision.
1374342558697074691	There was a positive covid case in my kid’s class. We were able to book him a test online, get the test the next day and had results (negative!) in 16 hours. Why can’t we do this for vaccines?
1369765438062788609	gonna do a short stream later. n I just tested positive for covid. please take the pandemic seriously still even if there is a vaccine out. hope to see y'all in the stream later n remember to mask up n stay safe
1481354468893540355	two of my teachers are out today bc of covid and i just went to science class and was told by my science sub that 6 people had to leave school in her last block bc they tested positive. and now we’re in the room with covid in the air and we can’t leave 😃😃
1474241288237039616	@claudiaitzela Wow. Ima keep it real I only read the first sentence. Ppl out here actually suffering from covid , I really thought you tested positive and felt bad. Last time ima half read your shit or care about ur health😭💀
1379518214384840712	@brandysheri I only found out a couple of weeks ago how most people have their teeth x-rayed - I'm so bad at the dentist they usually send me to hospital for xrays but they couldn't because Covid. You have my thoughts and sympathy!
1374395765129285633	I tested positive for the antibodies for #COVID19

1376562066912374785	@glenn_resists @JohnGish1 You have a different body. I had covid last yr, i slept in sheets soaked w cat urine for 3 days too Ill to do more than throw down food and water 4 the cats and had nothing but water myself until I could get into an Uber dr sent me to ER, they knew nothing of cv, diarrhea or die?
1388165394217775120	Latest view on England confirmed covid patients currently in hospital, with 1,161 reported as of 8am on 30-Apr.The count is now 1,161 and equivalent to around 19-Sep (i.e. 223 days ago). https://t.co/Cs3SvchaBM
1482104723612344321	I woke up this morning and had a sore throat. To be safe, I went and had a COVID test, which was positive. I’m home and have plenty of provisions. I also have a good Mama, who will drop me off anything I might need in the future. I can be reached on my cell phone at 256-596-0494.
1459620017142738947	My COVID test came back positive. I feel like I am fucking dying.
1419743882141700096	i think my covid test is positive👍im gonna miss my first gig since covid started NAHHH
1437077884024229894	@MarkBiggins Ok. I was done with this, but it’s actually kind of entertaining.  Let’s say you have a positive Covid test.  What exactly is the advice of the medical community that you say you will be following?  Again, this is after a positive Covid test, not measures to prevent getting it.
1443252095130472450	@Kate_Retired @repmarkpocan @JohnKingCNN @InsidePolitics @POTUS I had COVID and I didn’t go to the hospital — but now use that deranged thought process on obesity. Alcoholism. Diabetes. Drug overdoses.You’re mentality is sick and inhumane. Really reflect internally.
1452438324644401152	@texasguy37 @Mediaite You can get hospitalized from the vaccine and also getting covid even if vaccinated. What has happened to common sense? You are no less of a spreader than an unvaxxed person. I fact your are probably more of one
1413813397313970179	@Karenlovecheese Two responses I’ve had recently to the threat:1, I’m double jabbed, don’t worry, take your mask off ( when in a client’s house)2. When I told landlady I have a client in hospital with covid, she said “yeah, but they aren’t on a ventilator are they”I have no words. Hugs 🤗 🤗
1473864274695139332	@TheophanesRex Sure, I will pay for ivermectin and fluvoxamin. Then I want my taxes back, the ones that paid for the vaccines and vaccinated in the hospital with both covid and adverse effects.
1386292795460112385	@robdelaney Hubby had Covid lite (only two symptoms and a positive test). He was fine after both Pfizer shots. I did not catch the Rona and I was wrecked after shot 2.
1424902472200560640	Now they are falsely claiming children being hospitalized due to Covid. I AGREE CHILDREN ARE BEING HOSPITALIZED. I went into the ER to take my child on the military base and they were flooded w/ young children. My 2 year old has had runny nose, constant coughing up mucus..
1619396813626408961	@maria_sam22 Yes.  I am fully vaccinated and have never tested positive for Covid.
1340773660009902083	This year has been a whirlwind. Tirelessly fighting COVID-19 🦠 in the ICU since March. Got my COVID vaccine on Friday.

1379579571759157252	@DaveLeeERMD I was diagnosed with post viral SFN by my neurologist a couple months ago.  I was never COVID tested at the time because I did not have severe respiratory illness.  I did have the rash and some GI issues before my SFN symptoms started 7 months ago.
1573050696395640833	@BCReality @Milnoc @Mikeggibbs I have a upper respiratory infection and tested myself 4 times all came out negative so yeah not everyone who is sick is covid positive
1466104983938498565	@TFahim8 @disclosetv Except in other countries with more data transparency, such as UK,  Israel,  Gibraltar,  and more,  hospitalized from Covid are higher in the Vaxxed  than unvaccinated...I'm not saying unvaccinated never catch a virus. I'm saying the jab does not confer enough benefit vs risk
1434887336907653124	@ChadwikoTWW @ImRantBurgundy You god damn right it’s me. I have cancer and got covid and was sick for 3 days and took DayQuil and NyQuil. I never went to the hospital. It’s always going to be about me. This is my life. I don’t put suntan lotion on to protect your skin. I don’t wear a seatbelt to protect you.
1479673435349405696	@ErinAstrosFan I asked for a flu test and was denied.  They were like, “sorry you tested  positive for Covid, our protocol doesn’t allow us to test you for flu…”

1465896377385369602	I live in Chapel Hill, near UNC Hospital, which has a trauma center. The life flights pass over my house coming into the hospital and it wasn't a very regular occurrence before COVID. Now the whirl of the helicopter blades seems non-stop. Get the damn #vaccine, people!
1349449125360766989	6) Q: How can I prove I recovered from COVID? A: Bring your positive test result and a letter from your healthcare provider or a public health official that says you have been cleared for travel, the CDC says.Q: I've had a COVID-19 vaccine. Am I exempt?A: No.
1445260818182987779	@itsbridgertxn I had COVID.  When I tested positive I got a monoclonal antibody infusion and a week later I’m ok.
1480458933303193602	@d_lodger @Bigdogdigs It's important to know the difference as that is what drives gvt policy. I know someone that went into hospital to basically die of pancreatic cancer, got covid and that's what is on the death cert, not pancreatic cancer.
1486738330607886348	@MollyJongFast I had no trouble getting my test kits. I ordered them on Amazon just recently. I also am immunosuppressive &amp; am coming through a positive Covid experience, but I was asymptomatic &amp; feeling fine because I’m 3x vaxxed. Get with it Meghan:Amazon.
1451142815761772544	@alongnumber @MarkReady47 @gazcon @McGiff How is the data compiled? If I get jabbed Tuesday, then the next day I have one of the 10,000 symptoms listed under Covid and am injected with a spike protein by vaccination that triggers Covid symptoms, how am I registered in hospital? Because I know the answer. Do you?

1397617178346721284	(I am convinced now that, the more dangerous the illness the worse I will react to the vaccine. Rabies had me faint in the ER and bed ridden for a day, the flu knocks me right out, COVID made me sick for almost a whole work week.

1481453353372692488	@ralphamsden Individually, the person may need immediate care. I guarantee the wait is 57 hours because of people who don’t need to be there. I see people every day that call 911 to be transported to the ER when they could just do a Teledoc. But a fear of the word COVID consumes logic.

1381014571230490628	700,000 'cases' worldwide? What % of the world population is that? Oh &amp; how many are -in hospital? -in ICU?  I find using 'cases' strange, just look at every year 'flue' cases - hospitalisation - ICU - deaths; and apply same for this covid??
1373670992757788674	@shiremoorpotter And that’s within 28 days of a positive test ... I’d suggest deaths OF covid are significantly lower

1476951055850168323	"They keep saying that vaccination makes your COVID symptoms ""mild."" But for those who *aren't* hospitalized for COVID, I'm seeing the opposite. Unvaccinated mild is way more mild than vaccinated mild in people I've talked to."
1460610476069429253	@RickyLe80284150 @5mutmeg My heart is broken for people who are dying because after 18 months into pandemic pts are not advised for early interventions and still DO NOT have guidelines to treat symptoms from Covid at home …but letting them to get worse in order to be hospitalized…and die prematurely 😢 https://t.co/BhZR3bo8aj
1477117926779940872	I laughed so loud when I got my results back that I tested positive with covid-2 omicron like whatttt!!!??? How did they specifically know the covid and btw I have no symptoms at all and I’m on day 6 🥲
1381184385114853378	@latimeralder @RockyWasYer @GeorgeHaine I had it without being tested and without generating antibodies. My partner never got it because she has cross-immunity. So we can now never get a positive PCR test. So we can never get a Covid certificate. This is madness.
1488890643166416896	@Ikwane @NickHudsonCT Which reminds me that we thought he may have had covid in the early days when he clearly had flu symptoms. That didn't put him in hospital so not sure about the permutations but for sure he can hardly talk now from covid and he himself is not very confident about his prognosis.

When I said no they said you don’t have
1475950263659728896	@agershensonesq @UCLAFootball @MartinJarmond I could still test positive for covid six months after I got it.. doesn’t mean I have it. That is what is crazy about me this. If they are sick and can’t play i get it but my guess is they are fine but tested negative.. that is the problem with all this it is hit or miss

1330557672156848135	@mjohn470 We have a flu vaccine and the way you end up in the hospital with covid is your symptoms (flu like) leads to respiratory issues right??? So what’s the problem here? I don’t understand why me saying it’s similar which literally articles and media keeps saying so is an issue.
1476291943831322624	@FormerNiceGirl @hitxne @NanoPierogi I’m vaccinated, wear my mask and I keep up with my hygiene. I test regularly for COVID-19 and would isolate if told to or it a positive test result. I cannot however afford to take time off for a cold, which I can attend work for as it’s not against the law.
1358976230855499779	Crazy day. A guy wandering the aisle of Kroger asking for money. Also in Kroger a guy approached me asking about my button only to offer me $20 for an inhouse link to sign up for the covid vaccine. (I work in the hospital) There was nothing I could give him if I wanted to.
1475517695424557064	Bf gets exposed to Covid his family all test positive he starts having symptoms I’m exposed I tell my job oh yeah come in just wear a mask and Social distance ….. from kids who love to play and jump on you wtf
1555323178834169856	@dianaberrent I was hospitalized in ICU for altered mental status for 5 days.  I think my Lyme was reactivated by covid and I had a double whammy! Had trouble speaking walking etc. Treated w/ IV Rocephin 5, it cleared up a lot of issues for me and I begged to stay on it for 30 but they said no
1375195648287334402	Tested positive for Covid :/ Have no symptoms currently, if you need me I’ll be locked in my room for next 10-14 days with nothing but time to think about life
1481898756815659008	@picckl Same with my school, i literally caught covid but because I'm not showing strong symptoms anymore i literally have to goLike, I've still got symptoms, i tested positive Monday, i know more than 5 kids who have caught covid in school, but when the symptoms get minor we go back???
1374554725702529024	CA ICU, hospitalized &amp; deaths continue to drop. Population 40M, at what point does newsom letgo of emergency powers? I can't imagine it's after April 1st. As vaccines continue, covid is over in 90% of cities in CA.
1480996498410250241	@ChristyCeeCK @anthonyfurey How exactly? I'm sure there are serious injuries in ICU, thrombosis for example, is everything just Covid? You're as bad as the tnuc's who perpetrated all of this shit..! https://t.co/DaJ9FIbeIC
1501924840772714501	My stepsons 8 year old little boy who is vaccinated just tested positive and is symptomatic with covid...mask mandate hasn't even been lifted yet. Sounds like a great plan to have kids in classrooms without masks SMH
1380537605150887936	Young woman in TX gets JNJ 'vaccine' &amp; is now in hospital after numerous seizures.  I can't understand why anyone under 65-70 &amp; w/out comorbidities would consider experimental drugs.  Especially since for most, #COVID19 risk like flu. @AlexBerenson https://t.co/r1mg4R8JOm
1477061869563265032	@Breaking911 Many of us knew this was going on. So, what are real numbers of people hospitalized because of covid or died because of covid?? I doubt that was tracked accurately. It didn’t support the narrative and sell vaccines.
1532175736060133376	Half the household has now tested positive for COVID, and I would pay just about anything to rid myself of this stress.
1450949855417864192	@USBornNRaised I have known several unvaccinated that caught COVID again after natural exposure, tested positive but were asymptomatic and felt fine
1383349196103712771	@funfairprincess @andie1105 @STattisconie 5).. One woman I know in her 20s had massive reaction to her first jab and 100% should have called paramedics / gone to hospital but shit scared of catching Covid in hospital. Had second jab last Tuesday and so far silence despite me following up.
1429819722753880064	@CharlielnTheBox @JLknl5 The only people I personally know who have tested positive or actually been sick with COVID in past couple of months are vaccinated
1472512361139421190	Just tested positive for Covid &amp; I’m sad cause I won’t be seeing my family for Christmas 😭
1418006752734363652	@DanPriceSeattle I know first hand,  in August I suffered a ruptured appendix and spent 8 days in the hospital,  57 grand , the food was terrible and I suffered pain until recently,  no visitors were allowed because of covid and no therapy dogs i used the veterans choice act enacted by Obama
1519476328109678592	@JeanineCannon16 Thank you. Got mine weeks ago. Haven’t had COVID, hope I never do, but if I ever test positive I will stay home so I don’t spread it.
1475480899244470280	Tested negative yesterday then took another test today &amp; it’s positive? I haven’t left the house…I’m pissed #covid
1442865838105645058	@LCWF_TBK My neighbours recently had covid. I wasn't comfortable talking to the ones who hasn't yet tested positive outside, 2-3m away. Not a chance I'd have sat maskless in a room with them for 7 seconds let alone 7 hours. And yes, they all caught it in the end.
1472951933723983876	@eekymom One of the positive tests possibly was false. Viral remnants of the RNA but not enough to be infectious and the symptoms were from another virus? I wonder if we tested for COVID and flu simultaneously how often would both be positive?
1473402403596742659	@GarrettMWillia1 @themood2020 But then I was never scared of getting any variant of covid. I self isolated the moment I tested positive on a LFT. I didn’t take up any “precious” NHS bed. Don’t see how I am any threat to anyone but have been called such. It’s become a mad mad world.
1485663656746622977	Is it too much to ask to test positive for covid. I need my paid time off
1420414827231682561	@BubbaClaudius @RealSaavedra By the way, my facility has had NO covid patients for the past 7 weeks....but right now we have 13 patients with pnuemonia, 4 in the ICU on vents. Yes, Pnuemonia numbers are about average compared to previous yrs, but not being reported.
1374765792231841793	You said it! My wife tested positive with no symptoms. Couple of days later my wife and I went for a Covid test to a different lab we tested negative! Three family members that we had contact with went for tests all tested negative. Now, who do we Believe!
1434520615214620675	@Tennscarlett1 @Sadblueplanet @thehill I don't see why that's relevant. The treatment objectively works, and that cannot be disputed. It also cannot be disputed that 95% of people hospitalized for Covid are *unvaccinated*.
1537036608188428289	@andrew_croxford But is it a good control group? I always worry about a response bias towards those who have (a positive test OR LC symptoms). Plus many (most, by March 2022?) of those with no positive test will have had covid anyway. Some of the control figures look very high to my ignorant eyes
1502205591476858889	so i woke up today with dry throat &amp; body ache, decided to do covid test just to be safe &amp; turns out im positive 🥲 so all postage will be delay to next week 🙏 https://t.co/UqiSXztMho
1463127012948811776	@Ticketmaster how can I speak with customer service? Your online chat repeats itself and of no use in our instance. Need to sell our snooker tickets due to testing positive COVID test. We have physical tickets as cancelled last year. Nothing on our account? 🤷🏼‍♀️
1511781045250711562	@Wondermint2 @DrEricDing @BiobotAnalytics If you compare that wastewater map to the hot spot map, lots of differences. Where I live the wastewater map is very high, thou only 9 people are in the hospital with alleged covid; must be everyone has it, but are asymptomatic.
1471026457539403783	@grannyallan_val @Moi_RaRa @Sea_monster16 @Azeem_Majeed Stop panicking val. I'm unjabbed and caught covid and wouldn't of even known without a positive test. Stop quoting figures you know are meaningless, trying to coerce others in getting the jab. Not a good look
1489846094137892864	@_itsTreys_World @TheAndrewSystem @MattH_SportsPR @2Kalculated_ @SVO_Addi @EA_Easy Basketball fantasy is wack with all the injuries and covid positive test and close contacts. I was over it first week.Don’t come at me w a weak trade request neither 😅
1376666195923963908	4 kids and 1 teacher were tested positive for covid at my school today😋
1481836365658525696	Clove, Ginger, Oregano. That’s the TEA 🌱 !! I tested positive for Covid. I made this tea and then took a test the following day. Received my results back the next 24 hours and tested Negative. The doctors called me wanting to talk to me about what I did and how this happened… https://t.co/fkDJG7JBVu
1531037127332352000	@TRyanGregory An asthmatic 2x infected, non hospitalized, #LongCovid since March 2020 I’d say Covid was as harrowingly sick as think I could be at home. March 2020 I had a CT but I was desperate not to go to hospital. I didn’t see a MD until 4-5 days of 104° fever spikes. Posts like theirs 🤯
1372784204577042438	Well dam after a couple of days of feeling sick i did the covid test again and turned out positive well shit -.-
1471396043677970439	@Smacky1905 @FarmerRick @POTUS You haven’t been paying attention. Or you have willingly forgotten. I know a handful of vaxxed who became sick, but not hospitalized. And a long, long list of unvaxxed who are pushing daisies, who are in long term critical care hospitals, or who have long Covid.
1453031226005151747	"Statement from CMO Dr Tony Holohan after 2,193 new cases of Covid confirmed. 513 in hospital and 97 now in ICU.""I am increasingly worried about the rising incidence of the disease nationwide. Our primary focus now must be to protect the most vulnerable from COVID-19."""
1356725162180288514	More people have been vaccinated with at least one dose of a covid vaccine than tested positive for Covid in the US. A single dose doesn’t provide complete protection and cases are undercounted. But still I’m hope of our progress.  https://t.co/aUHS5UEwnm
1482549116441931778	@cowboyskanuck @jkwan_md If they got it they were ultimately okay but most people I know who have been directly exposed to omicron tested positive.  Vaccines work but they do not mean you will not get COVID.  That is a misconception.
1440082070298972166	Today I tested positive for covid and I want y’all to know If it gets the best of me and I gotta go…. I’m not sorry to none of you cocksuckas 🍊
1436179847441797124	@SkyNews Just had a week in hospital The amount of NHS staff I spoke to re: Covid vaccination who are abstaining was surprising.From nurses to my consultant.Do they know something we don’t ?
1434746084060979200	My baby boy Jordyn has had a runny nose since Tuesday and a cough a few days after. School required a covid test which he got back on Friday. No results yet but tonight a up &amp; down low grade fever that shot up to 102…so to the ER he went &amp; another Covid test
1482848143171469313	after dodging covid for almost 2 years while working in person the whole time, i finally have been beat by covid and tested positive…. feel like shit 👍🏼
1378060435367342084	I received my 8th day back to UK test result on 14th day from @midlandhealthuk@ukhomeoffice What is the point in that? What if I was positive and was out and about after 10 days?  #COVID19
1373360247646064641	@mdickson121 @ScottishSun The app only works when everyone uses it including those that have tested positive and the Covid test questions for those workers like myself are quite numerous. I have the app now but not for my first test so you would think where have you been recently would be relevant.
1453298578416353285	@timspector I’m trying to report a positive antibody test done through the Zoe app, but there’s no option to select that (even though it says it’s covered), so it appears as a positive Covid test. Surely that’s not right?
1583258300287635458	Apparently my professor for animal physiology tested positive for covid. Oh boy
1373627212348411911	@GPT561 @NicolaJCall @petemorristwit @Streakyblue1951 You can say the same thing about covid.I don't know anyone who had serious sympthoms.Oh sure i know lotsa people who tested positive with PCR testing.

1489430715221512192	I really love my district letting me know I was exposed to a positive covid case and that I need to be tested by three days before I received the email. Super helpful. I get it several times a week, clearly we just need to be all testing regularly but dear god is that frustrating
1486052224451055616	@pulte @Ford @pultefamilyfdn Help, my kids are home for the week since someone in their class were covid positive. My kids are fine, tested negative but due to protocol they have to stay home for 5 days since they were close contact. $redonkalous
1513639692159311886	Well, guess I’m taking a un planned vacation…. Tested positive for Covid today and can’t go back to work until Monday. Oh well guessing you see me streaming more! #fortnite #TinyTinasWonderlands #twitchstreamer #twitch #covidpositive https://t.co/42srPN3pFk
1478125592126054403	I retired #fifa22 due to EA spoiling the game this year. Game itself I actually like. Got positive covid test so stuck in for a few days. Chuck all my fodder in and 40k coins and get this. May play for a few more days 😀 https://t.co/7mFgK7Gk76
1476354602949873665	@Redsoxma @spudmonkey66 I had a patient the other night that tested positive for covid and flu! Ffs.
1472209937967325189	@macarthur54 @nytimes 2/2 I was hospitalized in Nov w/ Covid pneumonia. I got Covid from my wife. Both vaxed. She’s an ER RN, double masked, face shield &amp;proper PPE while working. Full blown outbreak amongst the fully vaxed staff in her ER. Not only did the vax not work, their masks didn’t either.
1387054431145971713	Please ask me to take off my mask in public. I'll tell you how I'm immunocompromised, doctor-ordered NOT to take the vaccine, how Covid killed my thyroid and put my husband in the hospital twice. Make my day.
1485846417763672073	@allstar930 @djvlad Like I said, you living off the media word! So the past 2 years nobody caught a cold or the Flu huh? Just Covid?! 😂 it be crazy and scary how yall programmed brain works.. If you sick and go to the hospital and they inject experimental medicines in you, you’ll die too ..
1475236849409003523	I guess throwing in a positive COVID test and getting the Test Match cancelled is one way to save further embarrassment 🤣
1443672538366844930	@jbarab @Zigmanfreud @disclosetv Your argument was that unvaccinated people are the cause of breakthrough cases if I recall correctly. I’m not arguing that unvaccinated people still go to hospital, but that they are not the reason for you catching covid &amp; spreading covid. Vaccinated &amp; unvaccinated catch &amp; spread
1480211914097631238	All I’m saying is I’ve yet to hear of one positive Covid test from Westview🤷🏻‍♂️And y’all called Wanda the villain smh
1476148295173038081	Is it fair that my work are making me go to a test site for a pcr when I’m writ off with COVID. After testing positive on a lateral flow test? Cause it don’t feel fair not gonna lie lol rough got walk to fucking temple meads 🥱😩
1380711160568295426	@SenPolehanki It’s a mess.  We already postponed our date to Apr 27th due to the almost 20% positive rate of COVID in Detroit and now I don’t know if we will hit that date.  It’s hard to council 11th graders on their options, but I remind them that the test will still be here this fall.
1387777956983054341	#COVID19 question for #scientist/#doctor/people in the know. If I take a test 23/04, 27/04, 30/04 and all are negative. Why would I have to isolate for a positive contact on 25/04? Would be grateful to understand the logic behind this. Thanks x#COVIDEmergency
1405100899928793090	I have to self isolate because someone in my class tested positive for covid. Online lessons for me and they SUCK.
1484842834847019008	Tunisia’s coach and goalkeeping coach both tested positive to covid yesterday and isolated from the rest of the group. Honestly I expect tomorrow’s game to be over at halftime #AFCON2021
1414886668298072081	@RomanSchatz @nozydog @LozzaFox Quite change from “I know so many people who died of covid, are in hospital with covid, have a long covid...”
1438422566318739456	@newscomauHQ My children will be pulled from school if they are forced to get jabbed. They are at up to x5 the risk of cardiac complications landing them in hospital from the Vax than they are ending up there from Covid. And if older people don't want the Vax, it should be their decision.
1478641156204339201	@milly_vibes When do you think Instagram culture is gonna be over with? I hardly go on, I get anxiety on there. Lots of Normies doing and saying normie things. Selfies showing off their fake lips and fake ass with captions like, “got tested positive for covid today.” I can’t take this
1380977568896188417	I know 5 people (including a family member) who got the vaccine... then not even a month later for covid and two ended up hospitalized (my age)
1479856659187093511	Hospital testing is for people who need medical treatment. I repeat, you do not need to go to the hospital just to be tested for Covid. If you are sick, stay home and get well!
1384482634919825409	so i've done 3 covid tests the last 3 days and they've all been negative but now there's a girl in one of my classes that i've last seen friday who had a positive rapid test today, and now has to do a pcr test... let's pray she's negative cos fr i'm not up for quarantine :(
1453424338917416960	This girl I know chose not to get vaccinated bc she already had COVID and now she has COVID again. I have been exposed directly now 3 times since being vaccinated and have had regular (2x a week) COVID tests and did not test positive or have symptoms once… That’s all.
1599587196566007808	Just got off the phone. 5 people in my immediate family caught a new variant of COVID and I couldn't get through for a few days. It was nerve wracking for sure so what a relief. My nephew had to be admitted to hospital but he's out now. So ya what relief. I can sleep again haha
1558989009602224129	POV I just tested positive for covid https://t.co/GpiVFit7Et
1466712675384053760	Just talked one of my frnd who is practising in Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi. She told 7 Covid +ve cases came in hospital which is no where in news. Don’t rely on Govt. Resources. Take care of yourself and where ever you need my help related to Covid. DM#OmriconVariant
1475585239363825667	Had to test for Covid bc someone tested positive for it.  Sorry to the haters but I’m clean.
1374708183684497411	@andrewbostom @and_kell I know a woman whose husband is 73,  overweight, was diagnosed with kidney disease more than 10 years ago and has had cognitive issues for several years. He got covid a few months ago and she now blames that for his decline.
1452117266175254532	@ChuckCallesto I tested positive 3 weeks ago, and I gave Covid to 2 grandchildren and I was vaccinated!
1376660908018184192	@jongold From what I understand they could still pick up Covid from the person who tested positive and pass it on to an unvaccinated person in your pod - the vaccine only prevents those two people from getting seriously ill 🥺 so they should isolate from everyone else and get tested
1508547258538733577	@dennismarsh236 I really think we should be getting better figures. We should be told how many people are dying only from Covid rather than with and we should be told how many were in hospital or died at home. It’s worrying if people are dying without even being admitted 😕
1385479265395912704	Unspoken prayer requests for my family please, as many members at once (including kids 4 and under) have been diagnosed with COVID. 🤞🙏 #EFFCOVID #imoverthispandemic
1483207312223313920	well i tested positive for covid woo, i worked at a pharmacy for a vet a year into the pandemic and didn’t catch it the whole time but ofc i get it when i’ve been wfm for eight months
1572323159193571328	2.5 years without Covid… Tested positive today. Then my work email was hacked. I think it’s time for a nap.

1440682497457618954	@JRider03 @konogiornogio @jordanbpeterson Sorry but a lot of people who end up in hospital with pneumonia (not just from covid) have long term recovery. Their bodies need healing, it takes time. My partner took 4 + months after release from hospital for lung function to return to normal (not covid related)
1531857839827742721	Question, does anyone know what the chances are of the at home COVID test giving you a false positive? I’ve heard there are a lot of false negatives. I just took one and it came back positive.
1443294034206896130	@stevengibson316 @MalluMotoVlog @Americanka4 As a scientist I can tell you that 5 people ending up in the hospital DUE TO a vaccine would be reported to the FDA &amp; we’d see it. Breathing difficulties, arrhythmia, tummyache are minor &amp; not worthy of risking permanent lung damage due to covid19 or even going into ER.
1478037472084779009	I took a COVID test Friday and it just came back POSITIVE for still having this fat juicy cock hanging between my legs…But also positive for COVID🥲

1510971449179136003	Made it this far without getting covid, but she caught up to me today. Officially tested positive. Feel like I've been hit by a truck. Had to teach on Zoom for 7 hours anyway. 0/10 do not recommend.

1373806097392406534	@just_mindy I understand. It has taken me months to forgive the med professionals who treated me that way. I finally came to the realization that they had such fear that they had dehumanized covid pts before we ever got to the hospital. Very sad.
1392313971189952512	@sailorv983 I had a client saying she’s tired of this “nonsense.” I’ve another client whose been in the hospital for more than six weeks with COVID. I’m so sick of these cavalier, selfish people who are preventing us from beating this virus.

1443559603162210305	As per the school nurse in Toms River, a sick child, (allergies, cough, sniffles, etc.) can come to school &amp; stay in school if you can produce a positive Covid test result in the last 90 days. (I don’t send sick kids to school, just sharing the morning BS) @GovMurphy #NewJersey https://t.co/7uaRbCDqtp
1456705884453838855	I'm still waiting for someone to explain to me the difference between being vaccinated and unvaccinated. Vaccinated = Covid InfectedUnVaccinated = Covid InfectedVaccinated = Spread CovidUnvaccinated = Spread CovidVaccinated = Hospitalized/DeathUnvaccinated = Hospt./Death
1380034570943336450	@TimBrando @TimBrando I am glad he is well. I hadn't heard any news on him since he was diagnosed with COVID a while back.
1483101371305971713	@NightShiftMD Meanwhile, back at the ranch, myself and every single unvaccinated person that I know who got Covid beat it easily and didn’t come close to being admitted. On the other hand, I know plenty of vaxxed people who did end up in the hospital. Funny how that works, eh “doc”?
1385216777626427394	@DDKeels @gisdonewirh2020 @JJVHouse I told myself that if I got covid, I’d have to get a lot more than 2 shots if I went to the hospital. Helped weigh out my options.
1504351904444432385	half of my classmates are ill and one just tested positive for covid. i’m gonna cry
1387156430952730624	@chrisburling26 @christopher_tfb Maybe they were better before covid but they make it impossible to see a doctor in person (I had strep and had to go to the emergency room instead of them, I couldn’t even talk) and when I had covid I saw a couple diff docs virtually and they were all very dismissive
1455050166038405126	@Pockity_ fun story!one time i had covid and had recently bought pocky sticks. upon testing positive, the pocky sticks were crumbled and nonexistent. don’t test me pock.
1485449980920090624	I've tested positive for covid 19 🥲
1407585986947780610	@ZokaShaun @StarofZ @pmwelltravelled @JuliaHB1 @tomhfh Another nutjob. I guess you've not watched any documentaries showing the state of the hospitals during covid, particularly in ICU? Where young people do get very very sick and die?
1434004681404059654	@judgar64 It’s more common with delta and even some with alpha. Only the original covid had zero deaths with the vaccine. I think it’s mostly those that are immune compromised (older folks and some health conditions) that are hospitalized and dying despite being fully vaccinated
1373236428612759554	I am not supporter of PM IK, but as he have tested positive for corona so my prayers are with our PM May ALLAH PAK bless him speedy recovery from #COVID19 https://t.co/iR3Is7MPCV
1544877509938155520	Also, am I supposed to believe that 16% of all deaths are in the unvax’d group, yet only 0.1% of all people in hospital are unvax’d?  If covid is causing these deaths, wouldn’t you expect to see a correlation btwn hospitalisation and deaths by cohort?
1424298215386517507	In the ER. Had to take an ambulance. Didn't want to come but had to because I had agonizing neck pain and couldn't take anymore.I suspect part of my port has either migrated/exploded. They gave me drugs, they've taken an x-ray. I'll be ok. Just don't want to get covid.
1386901305013280769	"Happy to congratulate you in any other context, but your response to ""have you had any close contact with anyone who's been diagnosed with or suspected of having COVID-19"" being ""I'm vaccinated"" slows the process down and makes me worry you don't know/care how transmission works."
1468264938674302981	@JasminGar2005 @travisc76 I call bull! They are sequencing Covid patients in the hospital with Covid!
1468087875942195200	@gb123geo I've been doing all right.  But yeah.  We've just been hearing, seeing, and reading way to much news stories about people getting vackcinated, and still catching covid to the point where they are still hospitalized and dying.  I guess I just have trouble understanding if
1486357031330140160	@pulte I’ve been out of work for a week sick and my fiancé just tested positive for Covid. This would be nice! https://t.co/mCK5WEkk0e

1425168930432245761	@nigeldacosta @wilroache @BogochIsaac If someone is able to get vaccinated but chooses not to and gets covid and ends up in ICU I am not paying for it with my tax dollars.   I know that’s harsh but the unvaccinated cannot have it both ways.
1374959198685908992	Thank you social media, i finally found the medical term for what I’m experiencing and it’s not a brain tumor... covid left me with severe parosmia. I’m diagnosed 🙌🏼
1385028066171367427	@TeaPainUSA They should understand about drug laws and why there's black box warnings on it.  I took it a year before covid and ended up in the hospital from it.  Hydroxychloroquine is highly toxic but is worth the risk to those suffering with Lupus.
1379765859472789505	@rudyardg You are crazy. Wild West in south I live here. Young people getting hospitalized now. No normal .. until fully vaccinated. Florida Arizona has been reckless south carina. I know 0000 of people who have had covid. Do you?
1410917799581585412	@andrewflood I actually give up. 14 people in ICU in a country of over 5m people with something the elderly are vaccinated against.. Can I actually ask? What is your end point? Do we just lockdown until zero covid? Oz has just proved they even couldnt do it. Im genuinely curious
1503357828110692358	@nytimes Dear Mr. President I just heard you tested positive for covid,,I hope n pray you recover quickly!! It hurt my heart when I found this out!! But I know  God will take care of you,, because I believe he has more good for you to do here!!  keep us updated!! My prayers r with U!😇🙏

1312456755704549376	Honestly, I think something is fishy about how the President has covid and the roll of people after his announcement now have it. He got some experimental vaccine of some sort and had to go to the hospital. All within a month of Election Day and days after a horrible debate.
1477018685709733896	Well - I too have fallen to the dreaded covid, tested positive this afternoon - meant to be with loved ones, but now having to isolate on own…..thanks sis for looking after me when was there……love you x
1474709791905918982	Luckily,the PCR wasn't the only positive test this morning 😆Symptoms seem to be much easier than the first time around when I was not vaccinated (as it was the beginning of the pandemic)#PCR #Covid19UK #positive #vaccine #MerryChristmas
1510575949665943553	First week off in about a year and I’ve tested positive for covid 🙃
1384668299208843267	@GovRonDeSantis 78 COVID patients in my hospital today.  12 in ICU.  That number in ICU will go up and so will deaths.  Just as high as the first peak.  Idiots who won't wear masks and get vaccinated.  That's him and his peeps.  You're loosing.
1418057568904257546	@dmvtrie I agree with social distancing &amp; masks. However, it affects everyone differently. There are people in the hospital with Covid, on ventilators who have been vaccinated. Getting the shot won’t guarantee anything.
1373241647992078338	I have come to know that Prime Minister @ImranKhanPTI has tested positive for COVID.  May Allah grant him full &amp; speedy recovery.
1403415607349973001	can someone pls take a positive covid test for me
1475111798210715656	Sick I tested positive for covid on Christmas 🤦🏽‍♂️
1526242976808284160	Tested positive for Covid but I’m asymptomatic and probably not contagious…
1484155080043634693	@marywallace07 @FergalBowers @rtenews Maybe covid and omnicron is so deadly that people are literally dropping dead on the spot with it and not making it to ICU!! That can be the only explanation I can see for a turnover of 17 people through ICU (4 discharged) not matching up with 52 deaths!! Interesting 🤔
1520076408126459906	Y’all, I’m so sorry I haven’t streamed since being back yet. 😭 I’ve had 2 negative at-home Covid tests, but I’ve got every symptom in the book and Mason tested positive last night. I took a PCR test this morning &amp; I’m awaiting my results so maybe that’ll be more accurate?! 😪
1442685161393565697	@theturner @Frazzling oddly enough, my back of envelope calucations suggest that Alberta paid $2.4 million in healthcare today (Sept 27) for Albertans hospitalized (general wards  AND ICU) for COVID19 #ableg
1384797772788948993	32 people were admitted to hospital with covid after vaccination, the numbers not the point here, I dont remember having Polio Vax, and kids still getting Polio, but just being only a little bit paralysed!
1383253320542801922	Tested positive for covid. Bring it on bitch 🖕 ain't no man made virus gonna do me in.
1442938094995443713	So almost 2 years of dealing with Covid in the ER and never getting sick and yet I find myself getting sick with a basic cold, congestion, sneezing, and coughing!! How does that happen lol!?!?
1476709265591222275	Well all my family members are testing positive for covid so I’ll be confined to my home and office until I inevitably test positive goodnight world 😖
1480663363814371328	@NativeTainoPR @lmauricecpr I just got the results ( finally)  on my covid test.  I'm positive.  My isolation period already is gone by.
1506618618729140224	@HillaryClinton .@HillaryClinton Funny, I Just tested Positive for #SICKOFYOUPEOPLESBSbtw I had covid too, with no shot needed. symptoms was a running noise and cough.funny enough just like the Flu. And yet here i am 24 hours later talking about it like nothing happened#Vaxifyawant #notme https://t.co/hz9pSrBdsL
1514325702383968258	My 4 vaxed family members who got Covid didn't get seriously ill, but all were symptomatic 2-3 days before rapid tests turned positive. If you have symptoms, stay home if possible, and if not, mask up. Don't assume a negative rapid test result means you're not contagious.
1445927449074802689	@tklibby @Harriet95821219 @battyroy1900 @DiamondandSilk I’m sorry that people that you know died with covid, and I will pray for you and their families. The fact is, they are reporting car accidents, overdoses, ect. As covid deaths just because they tested positive. You dont find that messed up? Guess not, you believe all you’re told!
1336393611106246656	@UKCovid19Stats So will all these deaths cease when vaccine  rolls out?I take it most of these deaths will not happen?Or will people continue to pass away just without a positive covid test...
1374449794286977025	@James_Daniel__ @alanhahn Since the season started I've never seen just 2 officials on the floor why this game one tested positive for covid looks fishy to me #REFS 🤮
1537146208325668864	Fascinating how the same speech is constantly regurgitated on social media across the globe.  I've tested positive for Covid 19 and will be self isolating at home.  I feel well and thanks thanks to the vaccines so get yours mumble mumble rhubarb rhubarb........😜😜
1387543868455878662	@KingFarmer13 I’m not sure.  I’ve heard everything from runny noses to in the hospital.   Small town stories tho. The covid number I got from the government website.
1341926300374724610	Glad he got a covid vaccine before everyone I work with in the ICU
1373556990836887553	@DarrenPlymouth Because the twats at sage  told us, that's about it for me, probably  know 100 people that tested positive, single digits for  people who actually had symptoms and absolutely 0 healthy people who died, know 2 who died with covid but both were seriously ill 🤷‍♂️🤔
1466893563288080384	@PeterCo16354149 @RupertLowe10 Let me point out that you are far more likely to die of cancer than covid but at the moment you are far more likely to get diagnosed. Go figure
1432597906536599556	Alamak our community driver has been diagnosed with covid, and i am a close contact. Pls pray for us 🥺
1383864899156078595	1. Have you tested positive for Covid?  (I have)
1379928996650094607	I just got my second shot of Pfizer today. I’m not going to get too sappy here, but I was uninsured for the first 11 months of the pandemic and I’m incredibly relieved that I no longer have to fear the financial ruin that would have occurred if I had to be hospitalized for COVID.
1453049430526025728	@GWRHelp hi, I am unable to travel on the scheduled date of time ticket due to covid test results coming back positive. Please can you advise how I can cancel? Happy for store credit or whatever, just don’t wanna lose out. Diolch yn fawr
1383013507906609152	@ricksokugawa If I’m vaccinated and get Covid, and I’m not hospitalized, I consider it a win.
1472215002920767491	@TransylvaniaSch Your ignorance and lack of a spine has ruined my family holiday. My sibling has tested positive for covid due to your mask optional policy and bending to the will of anti-science. Absolute joke of an educational institution. I hope pleasing the fools was worth it
1417534085740650499	@patriottakes I watched my SIL's sanity slip, day after day, while working in the ICU at her hospital. Pre-covid, she said they'd lose a patient maybe once a month. With COVID, it was up to 10 a week, sometimes 2-3 a day.Many considered quitting, because the emotional strain was too much.
1529746225901322241	"What ?!? I juste read Krejcikova tested positive to covid 😢. Such a bad luck for her return on tour. I would have been nice for her to ""at least"" defend her doubles title with Katka 😒. I hope she's ok. #RolandGarros"
1374035800195616768	@EssexPR ‘Within 28 days of a positive test’ so actual number, who have died *of covid* I imagine will be almost zero. I also wonder how many of the 17 were over age of life expectancy? Most I’d assume. This nonsense has to end.
1485235363111227392	@couch_specimen @MemeticZoetic @nytimes I've been in the hospital and talked to guys like you. while they were unaffected they swore covid was a joke because they were healthybut after getting covid they swore they'd never be so dumb to believe the lies. Some too lateHope you are one of the few that are unaffected
1479943753427210242	@briansh02353715 @OTURISK Brian, 90% of people I know have gotten Covid, and none of them were hospitalized or died. So, anyone that says Covid can cause hospitalization or death must be making it up right?
1463712620997971972	"I am seeing after Lisa got tested positive for covid a lot of non blinks including the haters are sending condolences to her. The proverb that ""You never know the value of someone until you lose them"" is true. Dont get me wrong as far as i have seen no hater has insulted lisa."
1478753918276493315	@BBCNews On the 1st anniversary of my partner Mary being admitted to hospital with covid before the mass vaccine rollout, I find hard to believe people are still not getting jabbed.
1472082764665176071	@lynton_H @ItsKingMthi @lerato_licious I don't understand this logic. Unvaccinated people are not willing to forfeit their right to hospital treatment if they get COVID. They are not willing to take responsibility for their choice. That affects you.
1473763899765936130	@gidget1974 @USBornNRaised I’ve had a “cold” for about 5 days…I did not get tested. I’m not going to help the numbers for Covid if it came back positive. I’m over this sh*t.
1313805957697359879	@das_bish @groggygroggy1 @steveb52890447 @spikeman666 @EstherMcVey1 Yes I did but that isnt happening now. The flu vaccine is great however if you have the vaccine and then need a covid test it can produce a false positive for covid? The test cannot distinguish between flu, common cold and covid. Cases are irrelevant without

1483253497998897152	@QTWIQ1 I’m immunocompromised with co-morbidities and tested positive for COVID last week but am already on the back end of it. I truly believe being vaccinated and boosted saved me from a ventilator and/or death. I hope you recover and that you have learned from this experience. (1/2)
1479407100715573253	It’s not confirmed that I have Covid yet, but someone I was in contact with has a positive test and we have similar symptoms. My main symptom is body aches. I think it’s the worst symptom.

1398977758911471616	I'm sorry but if there's an uptick of covid cases in hospital the wards should not be taken back for covid cases,  like an representative of the NHS has said,  they have to get on with the backlog of other patients who've been waiting over a year with very serious illnesses.

1463891438870089739	Tested positive for COVID but at least my Thanksgiving lineups are gonna be correlated as fuck
1490821236577869824	"@GenevieveReaume They are going to keep putting people in the hospital that don't need to be there because the hospitals get $$$ for covid patients. This has been happening the whole ""pandemic"". Seen it with my own 2 eyes."
1431004251682230275	@donwinslow I've been saying this all along. If you don't want a vaccine then don't come to the hospital when you get sick with COVID. Duh.  It's just a hoax anyway 😜
1439617864101601290	Had a dream I was back in a real gym for the first time. lifting and getting Into my groove…over the PA the person says “just so you are informed, 2 individuals who have worked out today have tested positive for COVID.” 😱 lol I’m not ready to go back to real gyms yet lol
1411870440075644932	@GooseRN_ @JokeLabro1 @adamseconomics 10-20%? ...so the minority, and that's of those that actually end up in hospital,  most cases are asymptomatic,  most don't even get covid...or are the reported numbers lies? eg. there's only a .0035% probability of me dying from covid!
1447909931470970883	Had a bit of a scare today been around someone who tested positive for covid I took a test to be safe an thankfully it came back negative , I have a head cold but rather that than the virus again. Stay safe guys please be cautious

1391775033995956226	@jkwan_md Dentists are not on the list and we face unmasked, open mouthed people daily. Patients  are all screened, however,  every dentist I know has had several scares with a patient calling them a few days after an appt saying that they've tested positive for covid.  :(
1430393141165760512	I need to understand this better- by my math, they are saying these 13 states have nearly a half million hospitalized patients with Covid?This is not the information I’m getting.So is this graph fixed, or skewed to present a specific picture? https://t.co/cRM8HQg7R3
1444792455304466438	@ThiaBallerina Sorry you don’t understand what I’m saying. You could have got Covid and died or had to go to the ICU. What makes you convinced that your injury is from the vaccine?
1454351136710922242	@canadiancarol1 @pureangel40 @petemorristwit Exactly but it was sold that a mild cold would keep you out of hospital. I think the truth is people going into hospital and staying and some dying are over 80 which is normal and has been for years only before they were with other respiratory illnesses and Covid tests say No
1398323389270347779	"@ashishkjha @ForeignAffairs I read in CNN ""Many of us may need one ( covid booster)next year, we don’t know. We’re going to track this closely.” How are you doing that when the CDC is not tracking breakthrogh cases except for those that end up in the hospital?"
1470116896951332867	@Buzzsaw1976 @ABCPolitics Are you daft?  I personally know several people that were fully vaccinated and ended up in the hospital.  Are you so ignorant to think that all the covid deaths are unvaccinated.  More people have died since the vaccine has been available then the entire 1st year of pandemic
1343947718205566983	@markinneswilli @Stanley40192067 @Polythunks I don't know teachers who want to close them. The virus spreads through schools, like I said I've encountered plenty who've tested positive for COVID-19. Perhaps it should all go back to normal, no testing, no vaccine, if you are too ill to work you stay off, otherwise you work.
1464284112223862785	@Ireland2020 I apparently have it now but I believe it's the flu. My flu test had a very light positive but the doctor said she didn't see a line. 🙄 They tested me for covid and bam positive. No cough, no sore throat, I can smell and taste too.
1376681401156706306	@DemocracyInn I thought he already tested positive for COVID during the election?
1372974605879672833	@dianaberrent We’re unsure if I had Covid last Spring bc I had a negative test &amp; negative for antibodies but my dr thinks I had it. I’ve never felt that way before or since. I’ve had a constant headache since &amp; was hospitalized in Sept w hypertension out of nowhere &amp; was very sick in the fall
1431039199436689408	"Right now you are 69% more likely than me to be hospitalized by Covid &amp; 49% more likely to die of it. You could always say ""well that's my risk to take,"" which would be true but no child under 12 has been vaccinated yet. The choice has repercussions. https://t.co/ODCLNkcOfa /4"
1480527565722832896	https://t.co/zpzMoK2wkL he faked the test, he was never positive 🤣🤣 this was my main suspicion tbh but I had no proof so I had play the part that he intentionally spread covid
1383188787212152832	Capitalizing on this to say that 30+ fully vaxxed people have gotten COVID here in Hawaiʻi (one person is hospitalized) because it’s a precaution not a 100% guarantee. You aren’t getting Superman shots for pure invulnerability, it just reduces your chances and the potential harm.
1518128380759187458	@DrTomFrieden For 2 years I've been following protocols, vaxxed 3x, double (cloth over surgical) mask indoors. Never tested positive for covid, but have not had the flu or even a mild cold during that time. Just my experience &amp; may have been super lucky,but I'll take win regardless.
1473712103475265550	it took not even a whole month of being back in the office for me to catch covid. We have close to 50% of people in office that just tested positive, yet we’re not going back to WFH
1489314039398289410	@ruskiegirl2009 @JoeBiden It’s not I’m not vaccinated, my wife is.We both got covid, her symptoms were worst, admitted to hospital Variables were she’s vaccinated and pregnant I’m unvaccinated and took ivermectin
1431086915219042309	Ok so I was in close contact with someone who tested positive for covid for now I have to quarantine 😃 https://t.co/iveszUBpfH
1386073410682462210	I rather jump in front of a car than to get Covid again. That feeling is so indescribable &amp; you’ll never know it until you actually get it. I’m not taking bout that 1 day of symptoms from the shot, I’m talking 3+weeks of that shit &amp; not knowin if you’ll be in the hospital by am
1418625543730188291	@AllenJones1701A @osirisleo9 I agree…I have had reactions to flu shots and I did get the H1N1 shot back in the day and ended up in the hospital with an allergic reaction, so I was nervous, but I did get both my Covid shots, no problems 🥳(Other than flu-like symptoms, that went away in 24hrs)
1506733300882284558	@Keggs719 In 2020 I went in for surgery for appendicitis, when I woke up Dr. claimed I had COVID because I was having trouble breathing. Had to be in ICU for 3 days and found out it was because my lung was partially collapsed from the surgery. She was an idiot and kept insisting I was C+😡
1475095510327480323	@GerryThorne @RealDeniseWelch I tell you a quick story. It's up to you if you believe me or not. One of my mates is like you. No problem with that. But just before Xmas one of his kids caught covid all vax'ed except my mate. All had mild symptoms. Guess what my mate is currently on oxygen in hospital.
1374822941171580928	why is taking a covid test so scary??? like, ik that i’ll most likely be negative, but the thought of positive scares me! 😭 (touch wood that the test is negative!)
1489478145174499331	@BigFish3000 I grok statistics, and they can be manipulated to mean anything. But if my husband (with about 1 1/2 lungs) got Covid and was hospitalized for three months and then died, I don't care what they say is the cause of death: It would be Covid that killed him.
1515880464485167107	@ScottUhlTX @Roosmama1 @marliessmits64 I can relate to what you're saying. I have long covid also and a year and a 1/2 ago I was in the hospital with heart complications from covid.  I also found the goodbye very reflective and heart warming
1474071327720062976	i tested positive for covid &amp; the first thing my dr said to me was “thank god you have your vaccine bc you would be doing much worse if you didn’t”
1375885605033377798	no lie, i know i need to go to the hospital but bro, i’m terrified of what they’ll tell me. what if it’s Covid? or really the flu? what if they find nothing at all??!! 🥺🥺🥺

1375590186814484480	High key think everyone in Orlando’s hospitality industry need to get tested for covid. The amount of people i personally know who are covid positive with minimal symptoms, including myself, is insane.The scary thing is spreading it to a higher risk or immunocompromised person.

1403479713067196434	@Katy_Scarletta @garrethmcdaid From what I understand of the fully vaxed groups, they're in hospital *with* a positive covid test rather than in hospital because of Covid, if that makes sense.
1432004438579896331	@GBNEWS Big moaning Minnie, as my mum would say. Compulsory vaccination of kids isn’t even proposed here. If it helps us all get back to normal, schools open etc. Why not?

I wonder how many more of the passengers contracted covid
1478427781159538692	I just tested positive for Covid and they straight up said isolate for 5 days. How can they say that with a straight face knowing damn well that’s not long enough.
1360368498107682818	@EpochOpinion @SharylAttkisson I think it’s only fair to attribute every post vaccination death to the vaccine, just like every person who died with a positive Covid test died from Covid..This is a fun game I’m starting to see that now..
1546531447082811392	@tasha_a7 Rang 111 and asked directly for a referral to the local Covid Medicines Delivery Unit. Just using that phrase seemed to open the door. After I had the treatment I got a call from the automated system activated by my positive test. Also don’t ring out of hours!

1345782665744678914	So I was presumed positive for covid days before my vaccine date. (Never tested) Originally, they advised to wait 90 (or 60?) days after an infection to receive the vaccine. During this time, your antibodies should protect you, right?
1386039430671175685	@sbattrawden @AngieT42 @NHSMillion Been to hospital twice in the last year, both completely empty.

Stop whining about something that affects so few

1472841986453372928	@MissNicoletta @Stephani_rr39 @ABCPolitics Most healthcare workers I know aren’t saying that. Look how many were fired for not getting it. When you are unvaccinated and get admitted into the hospital they test you for covid. They don’t test the vax unless they show symptoms.
1351972061116305409	Myth: If I get the #COVID19 vaccine I will test positive for COVID-19.Fact: The COVID-19 vaccine will not cause you to test positive on viral tests. If your body develops immunity, the overall goal of vaccination, you may test positive on an antibody test. #factsmatter https://t.co/5SzkUMEqZM
1488795492494581761	@doctor_oxford First, i would counter you on the Covid deaths, as you well know, well over 80% had underlying health problems.

1444104922581057543	Anyone else go visit family and have to leave the room when they watch the news? I purposely don’t talk about covid in the icu with them because I think it’s too much to put on others but I just can’t listen to it. My family is  vaccinated but just have no idea what we’ve seen.
1416915950348251136	"@Myrmecos Also - I've just started getting wise to this - ""tested positive for COVID"" can mean a dozen strands of RNA in the nasal passages, being successfully fought off by T cells.That would be normal for vaccinated people."

1460659809615818763	@EssexPR They inadvertently test people who were COVID positive within 90 days and in my trust they re test people they don’t ‘believe to have COVID’ who are asymptomatic if it looks nosocomial and go off the second result if negative. Point being it will be less.

1384127424871374850	@tiworryy I’m so sorry to hear about this. I heard that people do test positive for up to 2 weeks after they get the vaccine (not sure how true that is) even though they don’t have COVID. So either they had COVID from before or they may have had a reaction from the vaccine

Further, ""serious conditon"", when mentioned with respirators, could connotate ""critical condition"". ICU use from Covid is a smaller number still. My rough calculation 👇https://t.co/PX9p9NIf4Q"
1436344883195830292	@BRITTNEYOGLES @DonaldJTrumpJr And I would like the choice not to put you in ICU if you don't want the Vax and you get Covid
1476363087762522112	@KerryDawes12 @opa1420 @jean15849180 We are a family of 6 over Christmas. I had to reduce our food to afford RATs. Good thing 1/6 tested positive &amp; family in isolation. It is expensive to quarantine &amp; get delivery only. Covid &amp; close contact payments need to be rolled out for all.
1546479744996315136	@GoPoolie So you’re taking a drug that’s purposed for parasites for a mild, common respiratory virus? Have I missed something? Or is it like most people where Covid now takes 3-4 days to turn a test positive?
1477326244576477188	Finally got a COVID test and im officially positive besties 😍😍
1479139441822347278	Right? Absolutely insane how I can talk about how the woman who raised Me is in the ICU with covid, and there’s always that one man who says something completely out of line. If masks didn’t work, covid would be gone by now. Why won’t it go away? Because people can’t wear a mask.
1383047854881656834	@LakeRabour @Amanda_skol88 What blood type are you? I'm O+ and have read and heard that O types are naturally more resistant to it. My boss is O and his wife has had covid and he hasn't tested positive either time they tested him
1435192701306220546	@Smoke3x God gave me a brain. I feel like it’s my obligation to at least try and use it. So I took the vaccine, bc the NUMBERS, not the media or doctors tell me 98% of Covid patients in ICU are unvaccinated. I don’t have time for hospitals much less ICU. It’s football season. Get VAXXED!
1377716191720968194	@lwoodhouse @DolorMeBadd I think the number to look at is that of all the myriad of things that can land you in ICU, right now it seems to be 10% COVID.

1417360418964529154	@malviche People who are fully vaccinated in melb allowed out?The ones I know are rotting indoors like the rest of us, wearing masks like the rest of us, have to social distance like the rest of us, get covid tested &amp; isolate if in contact with another positive case like the rest of us..
1617507125676089346	@punishedfabio @Liberty_Ken @benshapiro @RWMaloneMD The last few tripled jabbed people I know that got Covid needed up in the hospital so not sure what “studies” you are referring to. Prob the same fake studies that said it was safe and effective. Both lies.
1377068742098755587	May I ask, if someone tells you they tested positive for Covid, all while protecting yourself. Is it a violation of Hepa law's to inform others? Or is that having morals, to warn others?
1549584380745613312	Why I just take a Covid test and that shit came up positive ?? LMAOOOOO
1326919527012110337	Being against the COVID vaccine is literally like being against the flu shot. Y'all are straight dumb if you don't get flu shots. I didn't get a flu shot in 2018 and literally almost ended up in the hospital. Hell, I probably should have but I was too disoriented to know.
1452471390360190982	Was supposed to go see @tylerrjoseph and @joshuadun in Columbus on Saturday but the hubby tested positive for covid. Excuse me while I go die inside 😭

1357688404964687872	@UKCovid19Stats Nice to see yet another week on week drop on deaths in hospital. I wonder if the vaccine is helping?
1376423347165224965	@VinGuptaMD I have Guilliane Barre and was just diagnosed with CIDP . Do you suggest it is safe for me to get the vaccine ? I feel like I am more at risk if I get COvid  than  the vaccine.

1426238585322287105	Just got word that someone in my gf's family is in the ICU with COVID and no they weren't vaccinated. Wish people would start taking this stuff more seriously.
1374159349447159808	@_DomoWilson1 When I got my first covid vaccine I had a terrible reaction to it. It Almost sent me to the hospital. I personally won’t get the second vaccine of how bad I got.

1549754077826932737	@theliamnissan I've felt that way for a while. Get covid, go to the hospital. Oh, you're not vaccinated, go home. Our beds are for folks who want to live.
1426041478166585345	@Jesse_King_359 @ecq023 @swl96830698 @JoshuaFechter @TexasTribune @farahelto I had covid and it lasted less than a week. Didn’t need to go to the ICU and I doubt I will since you’re basing that opinion off fake statistics anyway. But keep wishing suffering on others for not agreeing with your narrow point of view. https://t.co/9TeNxEYj3d
1520784769583251456	If this is day 3 of when symptoms started and day 2 of positive covid test. I have to say I feel a lot better. I've used different OTC meds and drank tons of water. Here's to hoping this is the near end.
1389306878459531274	A guy I've been training at work for the last couple weeks tested positive for covid. Just got sent home from work and I get tested in an hour. Really sucks because I've been really safe this entire time (mask, social distancing, etc.). I've already got my first shot too 😔
1384850963958218752	I pray that much of the ppl in the hospital didn't catch covid..
1435255272663093250	@daviddiano @JordanSchachtel I talk to nurses in the icu complaining about how many covid patients they take care of themselves.
1376281215779622912	@robinmonotti @LandoFree And you’re a poor soul that’s simply clueless because you see what you want.  Trust me, hospitalized Covid patients aren’t out there in public infecting people, you idiot.  The people that are INFECTED and ASYMPTOMATIC are the ones spreading it. Think spring break. 😉

1373023904780931078	In #Massachusetts, the 7-day average positive test rate for #Covid19 is at 16.40% (not 2.01%, as claimed) and rising. Reduced testing among the general population has made new cases and positivity rates unreliable. Focus on Hospitalizations in my daily tracking chart. #WearAMask
1389211987176001538	@Braden_Keith There is also a MASSIVE undercount in the actual totals in India. While there were likely some deaths at peak that occurred not in hospital due to covid, I would bet nearly all hospital deaths due to Covid were captured in data. The undercount in the US was community cases

1410726435182972928	SO... I get exposed to COVID today, by a patient that has had it twice, her spouse likely had it a month ago. She tested positive twice last week. She has symptoms and when asked the screening questions. Guess what they answered to those.
1422982239357267968	@corman_irene You know why im@careful? Because I’ve spent way too many days in hospital already. I went home from a major surgery 2 hours after recovery- they wanted me to stay. I wanted to eat. Better pain management at home. And that was before Covid.

1365033652728520705	I’ve survived a brutal experience with Covid, had my first vaccine and been working the majority of the time in the hospital including in Covid areas. Now you decide I am high risk?
1479109921878646798	I’m a fully vaccinated asthmatic who just got Omicron and spent a day in ER due to a lung clot. This is not a cold and Omicron is far from mild. Please get vaccinated because humanity can’t handle any stronger variants. Stay safe! ❤️ #covid19bc #bcpoli #vancouver #GetVaccinated
1379920437572943874	@Brad_____enship @erykanders Quite possibly, yes. Especially if I want to be 100% sure not to spread a highly contagious and potentially deadly disease.In the last week I've had 1 person I know admitted to the hospital, 1 person die, and 1 person very close contract covid. So I'm going to keep it up.
1519025430535151616	@Debs_Kropotkin @medriva I'm vaccinated and boosted and I tested positive with Covid over the weekend. I feel lousy...
1438600452246052864	“i dont want you to quit” im in the hospital WITH COVID and you told me to come in? youre putting other people at risk to get covid and im LITERALLY IN THE HOSPITAL?
1386304226989645827	The Lancet study on mental illness following covid isn’t causal - it’s just showing prevalence of diagnosis after covid. As others have noted, being in ICU is kind of traumatic by itself, so I feel like there are multiple explanations here as well.
1447485757837434885	@dave_rennick I got Covid in the early 2020. Back then they didn't test so I don't have a positive PCR test to prove it. Been dealing with on/off long Covid symptoms ever since.
1470851214111817730	The only positive thing in my life is my covid test.
1489121402842144773	@RpsAgainstTrump Me. After four days with someone, riding in the same car and eating the same meals, they became ill with Covid and I didn’t even test positive. I had a really good result from that vaccine.
1479310314944483328	i tested positive for covid 69 on a rapid test and my crush brought me some tea, cough drops, strawberries, and lemonade 🥺😫🥰 i wanna tie her to my bed and read her a nice little book once her arm isnt broken ❤️ https://t.co/fnIMmz7WTm

Everyone else had had the ""We're here to treat everyone"" philosophy, and were compassionate and helpful. Everybody was chill. This isn't Travis, tho."
1418443249262399491	I’m going with all tested positive for Covid regardless of being vaccinated or not
1478495601100791810	WVU medicine says we should come to work with a COVID positive test result to help reduce staffing shortages. I don’t remember seeing “must be okay with killing people” in the job description.
1481081181336895490	@goonereol @AgentSaffron In my home everyone had tested covid positive last week and they are all fine.
1424589344484978698	@garigalAnj @droverdriver61 I remember. Incarceration activities Debbie Kilroy was on Duttons flight, was diagnosed a few days after him, and for months afterwards had long covid.
1464721194674884615	@NTrexit Mine wasn't. I take a medicine that apparently makes the vaccine not work as good. I was double vaxxed and was sick for a month when I caught covid, hospitalized for two weeks and still struggling with my health 5 months later.
1509071859035537411	@galexybrane Im in samoa and have recovered from covid. I AM not allowed to go to the hospital. This is going on 6 months now
1543607289998819331	@jakenbakeLIVE I recently got covid and a few days isn’t gonna cut it, a week later and I still test positive
1380710120376561664	@ipachik4ever @chimrychels I had a stomach flu, thought for sure I’d test positive for Covid and get a couple weeks off. I tested negative and had to go back to work. Covid sucks.
1373200307627421701	@kimKBaltimore My papa had dementia and he fell walking into the grocery store causing him to break his hip😔 he went downhill very quick after that. It is sad. I would never make fun. But it's also sad when the left laughed when trump was diagnosed with covid and wanting him to fall.
1421068297576095748	I tested positive for Covid yesterday and have now been dealing with flu-like symptoms for three days.  Being a person who can be hard on himself, I’m taking comfort in the knowledge that I did all I could to avoid catching Covid…continued
1339946090750210049	"@realDonaldTrump I do not understand the advocating of a vaccine for something that has a 99% recovery rate (If it's even a real illness at all. PCR test is not a diagnostic test but rather a forensics type process...people that have the common cold would ""test positive"" for Covid using PCR)."
1501330013521530881	@TIME I have given up on WHO.  They cannot provide straight answers.  A Yale study showed the booster goes to 16% after just 3 months.  Fully immunized are getting covid at a record rate.  Look at PEI, 1 in 40 have it currently.  With only 2 people in hospital (pei site).
1550862710216204292	@SJM18T @WSJ I think a UK study that just came out said that like 90% of patients hospitalized with severe covid of death since 2021 had been triple or quadruple vaxxed.
1482043493698748417	Another bummer. My COVID test was shown positive due to a faulty test kit. After suspecting the first kit, I got two other tests from different brands of kits and both showed it negative. cc @EjazMalikzada @hehsani71
1433742557654122503	@MacauxB @RandeeCole2 @DrEricDing I don't want to name the school yet. Another district opened on Tuesday and 5 kids tested positive for Covid on the first day.
1385662598499258371	@pwsimerimiaw @rooney30 @JeremyVineOn5 1/2) It really does.  I’ve adhered very strictly to all the lockdown rules as I’m in a bubble with my 82 year old mum who has health problems and I have autoimmune issues.  I had Covid last March which I caught in hospital and it took me 5 months to feel slightly human again.
1476984966156365830	i tested positive for covid again. im sick of this shit
1475142637946552328	@The_Lioness420 @Aisling_Pash It's easy to talk shit until you're face to face with COVID patients, climbing under their trolleys to get to the bathroom, watching them fight just to breathe.I've been to hospital Manu times, but have never seen it that bad, and that's all down to COVID.
1476578729727987713	@passittobulis Quiet, the guys doing the covid tests might be listening. I remember when one guy tested negative one day, then positive the next, then negative again. The tests are flawed, obviously.
1486110055036555270	on the real tho get those 85 Covid shots bc I have mine and I wouldn’t have known I was positive if I didn’t take a test I just thought I was very tired from depress
1602338815066230786	@CollinRugg The best thing that the public could see to prove how ineffective this supposed covid vacc is, is to show the percentage of vaccinated patients are being hospitalized and died after vaccination. Let facts speak for themselves. Last percentage I saw posted was 58%
1385971700584652801	@jasminericegirl I had a really bad kidney infection early 2020, before covid.  Throwing up, extreme stomach and back pains.  I was scared to go to the ER because of the cost.  Went a few hours later.  They said if I wait any longer, I could've died.  Bill was over $12,000.

1453851953667231745	@PeterRo56892457 It shows me that vaccinated people get COVID. And then it shows me that when they do, they’re less likely to land in the hospital or die https://t.co/BcQ2Gx7uKY
1376370348946550786	@Kings_seek_her @denisrancourt @tinwisc The point I was trying to make is there's 139,551 90+ year olds in Ontario. 2,251 of them passed and are in the covid stats.This means 1.6% of this group died this year with covid. But only 1.2% were hospitalized with covidWhere did they die? Why weren't they in hospital?
1384364348064161795	@tgijass “i have been in contact with somebody who has tested positive for covid”
1375590193445675014	@naomirwolf Everybody has been doing pretty much everything normal and no deaths Just putting that out thereHaven’t heard very many sirens Have not heard of anybody having Covid and going to hospital or dying I guess the lockdowns are working? Or maybe this is all bullshit....🧐
1442273144048291844	@RobertIField @drexelpubhealth @DrexelKline @DrexelNews I guess it depends on your world. Our company has over 500 employees, and 75% have been diagnosed with Covid since Dec 2019. Only two hospitalizations. Zero deaths. I know many many businesses that can say the same.
1460023476354523137	@SkyNews Same COVID-19 that killed vaccinated people and hospitalized people with double vaccination? I don’t understand for real. 😂
1378018651668946949	@Insurance_Rich @EssexPR I had my partner shielding since March last year, I have been leaving the house and managed to not bring it home to him for all that time.He gets admitted to hospital for 5 days and then told someone on the same Ward had COVID and I'm partner needed to self isolate for 10 days!!
1397590256908652545	@LaineyMart I don’t think their risk of getting covid is high but I’d be concerned about the risk of the ship being stuck somewhere if people on board test positive.
1427609722484559876	@RIDICULO_pathy @DrNancyGlass1 Even this is a graph about England I guess the proportions will be about the same. (In England) RSV and COVID hospitalisations are similar for age up to 5y. The same amount of kids aged 6-17 are hospitalized (so COVID is 2*RSV in England in terms of hospitalization). https://t.co/abccEm41Lc

1472958538523631617	@VeronicaTellsIt @whereistruth17 I’ll never get sick enough to go to the hospital because of Covid, because I’m young, healthy and not over weight

1424369189205250052	@avivhadar Had covid twice. Both times were very different. The 2nd time (May 2021) landed me in the hospital. It's fkn real ppl. Science is a thing, look up gain a function. Look up evolution of a virus. These variants will continue as we continue passing the bug along..

1423341575678185476	@AddictPerfume Excellent piece, I looked after Covid patients for 10 months before catching it and spending time in ICU, 6 months on and I’m slowly getting back to work. It’s been a long time and there’s a long way to go for many. I’m very lucky
1611886869092110336	@myrabatchelder @mandatemasksus Done. Happens to also be the day I tested positive for Covid, despite masking everywhere. I really hope this makes a difference, and that officials are finally ready to do the right thing.

He was in the hospital for the months and lost a leg from Covid. The drs can not say we will not get it again. And they WILL NOT say you can’t spread it after a vaccine.No vaccine for me.
1382867092144283652	If you don’t remember where you were when @tomhanks tested positive for Covid, I don’t trust you
1384254071633158144	Ohhh, great idea! I was on a running podcast this fall but we talked covid &amp; public health (esp. in athletes) for 3/4 of it. A twist was that the host revealed he had just been diagnosed w/ covid so I answered a LOT of stuff!

1441138587764854784	@OldMackIsBack @GreekEconomyFTW @Holbornlolz Genuine question; what are the numbers of those in ICU with covid? Vaccinated vs unvaccinated. I couldn't see it in the report.
1379601695378976769	Covid test tomorrow, Because I'm having surgery Friday. Stage 0.  B cancer.Prognosis good, but still. Staying positive 👐So yes,  I will eat a cupcake in bed.

1375230003466633218	This time last year I really wasn’t very well - completely knocked out - and unable to get tested for Covid - but that’s what it was - just hoping I didn’t have to go into hospital - took till May to feel 100% - and sometimes I still wonder if there aren’t lasting effects 1/3
1434320657991536646	@chrissmith1313 @GManBN375 @WhitlockJason Honestly,  many hospitals are overwhelmed,  and as someone who cares for covid patients in the ER all day,  I can tell you that workers are absolutely overwhelmed. I still vehemently disagree with mandates.  No one has a right to force vaccines on anyone.
1393019030823448597	The 8 members of the NY Yankees that tested positive for the Coronavirus this week were fully vaccinated. Yet, @CDCgov &amp; @potus expect me to trust that not wearing a mask is safe? Nope. Not a chance. #Maddow #maskoff

1441423244402348035	@TheView @VP @KamalaHarris What??? Ana and Sunny tested positive for Covid? You have got to be kidding, and they’re vaccinated. This horrible!!! Get well Sunny and Ana. I love you guys.
1592575718403166208	@AlexSithole I'd also be sick or test positive for COVID. Mshololo is a sharp shooter.

1388479414221017089	@milneice If we test covid positive, it's 2 weeks off, paid. But even before that, in 2019 I had a 6 week medical leave of absence for surgery, paid. We have personal and unpaid time off options that I save for sick days. I save my vacation for long holidays I want off.

1594353615954923520	@ReportingfromNY @DavidMDrucker @GovChristie @RJC I’m sure he wasn’t hospitalized with Covid because he’s 500 pounds overweight. It was Trump. 😆
1378133566689660928	Majority of people hospitalized for covid have lingering effects months after, many maladies now have data linking increased risk to having had covid (diabetes is the most recent I've read about)So in 5-10 years how many people will have health effectsWill vaccines get blamed
1469736263238492161	@GerryCallahan I think you miss the point. Yes his weight made him significantly more likely to get very sick from COVID but, regardless of his weight, to not be told he would be in close contact with someone who tested positive is inexcusable. And it’s even more outrageous given his weight.
1471480199783104512	@christeeniee @Channel4News Very glad to hear you're getting what you need. Hope it has a great outcome!Anecdotal info I have is that the vastest majority of COVID patients in hospital are un-vacced.Best wishes!
1459887119833329676	Another former high school classmate is hospitalized with covid. They have an immunocompromised system and I don’t think they are vaccinated. Sadly I’m not shocked anymore.
1507377887409631236	@oiler3535 #4 I was hospitalized. They gave me Ivermectin. I was fine in 4 days but I had black on my lungs. That cured in a month. Covid is not a killer of people. Covid is a killer of small business not recognized by the provincial or federal govts for assistance…

1338713530300837888	"2/Her: “Dang. I would be the one to test positive for #COVID on the same damn day they start giving the vaccine.” *chuckles then coughs* I wasn’t sure what to say to that. So, I let out a weak laugh, too. Her: ""Damn. This is kinda scary."" Me: *thinking* ""Yeah."" It is."
1515213812189868032	@girls_can Trolls ?? You Twitter doctors don’t tell the truth. I just left rvh and they think i have COVID - waiting for my results. I have 2 shots and both doctors told me if I test positive that getting COVID with both vaccines is stronger than ppl that have 3 shots.
1372709972535095297	Geno Auriemma says he’s still feeling “great” after his positive COVID test.Though I think he said he’s had a bottle of wine every morning since the pandemic began???
1571115118209138688	@RavenApollo2 @drsimonegold Threatened to fight you? Was this a single event or a daily occurrence? I cannot imagine this as most of the jerks I’ve run across were the Covid panic Karens. I know people who had zero reactions to the shots and I know people who’ve been hospitalized from the shots. It’s random
1390328610498748416	@TuckerCarlson @foxnation @FoxNews I know someone who was diagnosed with cancer two days after getting the covid vaccine. Does that mean the vaccine causes cancer or is it a coincidence? Hint: It's a coincidence.
1472300430067580928	I tested positive for COVID-19 yesterday. I am symptomatic. I am fully vaccinated and boosted. I was isolated alone for over a year before being vaccinated because I am severely immunocompromised. I am scared and furious. https://t.co/ISSTpguZ5i

1410707556176121862	First day as an ECT and I get home to find my boyfriend has tested positive for COVID…. Wow will I feel horrendous if I pop a bubble on my first day😭😭😭
1416147922996006912	@nancha1107 @jenomi2well My roommate got COVID from his DOCTOR &amp; passed it to me. I did not have to go to the hospital but he was within a day cuz of his oxygen levels. He went in for treatments to his doctor daily. He's ok but can't get a shot right now because of autoimmune conditions. He's concerned.
1381702711024947213	Today is my Birthday and all I got was a positive COVID test

1488341667111395328	@mltrickey @brett_lochner @ShannonJoyRadio Baaaahaha..the Washington Examiner??!!! Total rag...flush worthy . I wouldn't read it with your eyes. They say  pediatric patients admittedWith CoVID. They came to the ER with CoVID. Which means they had COVID upon entering the hospital. https://t.co/sNsCglCrgA
1579244943704748032	@nursekelsey I have cancer, just diagnosed in June, and I haven’t avoided getting Covid this whole time to catch it now when it really would not be a good idea.

1323729689563705345	Guys, I went to the hospital today and asked to get the COVID vaccine. They told me they didn’t have a vaccine yet. I don’t believe them. Trump said we’d have one by Election Day. It’s Election Day. Where do I get it? #CovidVaccine #ElectionDay

1522819942122405890	I’ve never tested positive and unless I’ve had it and been completely asymptomatic … I have not had covid😳
1477963127727742978	@Nottsqueen Plenty of people I know (6 people) with Vaxx, young and old, now diagnosed w/ Bloodclots, only one got COVID…
1426615575221047302	@AaronBosterMD Is this not well known? When my child was hospitalized and found to have WML, we asked for her to be checked for Covid antibodies and the hospital refused. They said the treatment would be the same. Excuse me, if the cause is Covid &amp; not MS the treatment is not the same.
1419270724758425601	@bryanvilleneuve @Vladtepesblog I was one of many who caught it in church, 6 people out of 80 were hospitalized. The 74 who were not was just a mild to moderate cold. I have a Ministry to the homeless and not one of my homeless people. Covid. It is an engineered Panic not a real threat
1383168323798568963	Why do all the COVID deniers run to the hospital when they get it? I seriously don't get it.  If they're so convinced it doesn't exist why get treatment?  Their God and guns won't protect them?
1350708920130662400	@moderna_tx Thanks to your scientists for the COVID-19 vaccine! EMS provider here. I got my 1st vaccine on 1/08 (no side effects). On 1/14 I was fatigued &amp; feverish. On 1/15, diagnosed with COVID-19. But, other than the one day, I feel good! Thank goodness I had gotten that 1st dose!
1479582628537905154	My BFF has covid and has had it for a while, so she wants to get a rapid test to see if she's still positive. They want to charge her over $100!!! A PCR is free, but that will likely still be positive. WTF
1514437864901132292	@almostdita I'll be missing you coverIt was near bedtime. I was still in the hospital coz of covid and my army nurse recommended a few BTS perf on YT. And the moment I heard Namjoon.. that's it!💜Stream #BTS_Butter by #BTS  on all music platforms @BTS_twt
1375429839621132289	@Gareth_Stringer @Highberry_AFC Also ‘everyone survives covid’ This is untrue and horrible to hear for all my colleagues slogging in ICU, seeing so much death. And also really nice that, for everyone who has lost loved ones to it 👍🏼
1440343770029969414	@shantismurf @LinkXRP @NPR I’m a fully vaccinated person who contacted covid and was hospitalized. So, no. The hospitals are not “filled with the unvaccinated.” That’s some wicked strong hyperbole.
1480940027865669632	I actually want to be tested positive for covid, bcs 1st i’m most probably half way thru it, so it would pass by so easily. 2nd, i’m so done sitting btw these exact same 4 walls for 6 days straight

You literally don't know since you didn't have covid prior to being vaxed. And that still doesn't change my initial comment. Vaxed people are still being hospitalized and are dying from covid...
1435784086870708224	Hi Nate. I have three different blood clotting disorders. I am vaccinated. I got COVID last week and I was hospitalized for three days. I want my booster. I can’t risk getting sick again. I also have a 3-year I want to protect. So, please. Shut. The. Fuck. Up.
1381014992032567296	@MMcNutt__ Okay i hear you. I’m assuming they allow one person in for birth bcas no one has been diagnosed with Covid it’s just a precaution for the baby. The people dying in hospitals from Covid is going to be dealt with way more seriously bcas someone is literally dying from virus
1380915170004852739	@aroohli This is what I read but please do your own reading as well to confirm.Covid tests do not look for the whole virus to give a positive result.It's like a food recipe - if the test finds few matching ingredients it says yes you can cook food (positive).
1542176559733346306	i know we live in such unserious times because why did i see someone add a pic of their positive covid test to the june dump tag on instagram lmao
1554225032896733185	Tested positive for covid 🥲 this sucks. I can barely breath due to my asthma, now covid ? 😒
1411957406679109637	@DocMoschos @dgurdasani1 But the statistics show children are not affected by covid to the point where they end up in hospital. And there have not been enough studies to show the long term implications of vaccinating children. I am not sure why you feel there is a need!
1610867042592194562	a positive covid test…happy new year to me 😷
1520060141005123585	@djkw418 I shoulda said something like that probably but instead I used the “kiddo went to the er with Covid and he misses going to games”
1569027986355003393	@Jon_JA6 @EthicalSkeptic Took me 2 years to get diagnosed with long covid. To suggest doctors are doing this willy nilly is ridiculous. I'm sure it happens but most refuse to believe it's a real thing.

1381269188661157892	One year ago today was my first covid test, which ended up being positive, and led to a two week paid vacation. I enjoyed sleeping in, doing cross stitch, and watching daily press conferences. https://t.co/4QLrEU5gfB
1386765991405785090	can someone help cheer me upi just got back into school, today's the start of our 2nd week. a kid I don't even know tested positive for covid but he sits at my table so i have to quarantine for 2 weeks. I just made it into our musical too. even if I test neg, I can't go.
1553460745496576002	But he’s vaxxed and quadruple boosted.  Please tell me again a real reason other than money why this vaccine is being pushed upon us.  And don’t they know you can test positive for months after contracting covid? Harris is not equipped to be president. https://t.co/BafmG9EpyW
1474798410070994961	UPDATE!I don't have covid or any symptoms! I went somewhere very populated and traveled via airplane. The location I went to is reporting positive cases, but since I can't get tested until Monday, I am quarantining myself just to be safe

1415247223978348551	@M0NKEY_MIND @Hold2LLC I’d be curious if they are in the hospital for Covid at all or just a positive test.
1339800046821380098	I may not have been a nurse through this pandemic, but as a CNA I have spent countless hours with the sickest Covid+ patients in the ICU and across the rest of the hospital. Please don’t worry about what’s in the vaccine. Trust science.
1544458079256940545	@AzukitaChiquita Lots of water and vitamins. Listen to what the doctor says. I was in the hospital for 2 months last year with covid. Make sure to  have a oxi-meter to monitor your oxygen levels. Hope you have a speedy recovery. ❤️‍🩹

1376509895831355393	@BadMojo9 @DPJHodges I agree &amp; I do understand. But what if your chances, for some reason you don't know about, even if you're in your 20s or 30s, are not as great as you think? Younger people do end up in hospital with Covid. It's a big risk to take.
1510931224679886853	MT @Joseph_M_Brown: Fellow #ISA2022 attendees: I came down w/ fever today tested positive for Covid. I’m vaxxed &amp; boosted &amp; I wore a KN95, but if you attended any of following @isanet panels, you should probably get tested. Very sorry... Please feel free to retweet. (1/ )
1413023156650995717	I've tested positive for Covid. I continue to wear my mask everywhere I go, I wash my hands frequently and use hand sanitizer, and I still got it. It just goes to show that it's not safe. Please stay safe everyone. 🤍
1376663560877703172	i tested positive for covid today. if you have been near me in the last week or so, PLEASE DO NOT hesitate to go get tested.
1439768598034198528	@TheGameSheet I think they have 55 in ICU in total, not 55 new admits today. Which is still INSANELY high. If we had the same per capita ICU rate in Ontario we would have 691 patients with covid in ICU right now.
1560692503220670465	@MeetJess One of my fears as I work in this field. I mask at work even though I'm pretty much the only staff who does. I had a sinus infection a few weeks ago and even though I was diagnosed with it I still did covid testing the entire week to make sure it wasn't covid. Not playing around
1381902086325952514	I’ve witnessed patients dying alone in hospital during covid, only 1 family member allowed in at the last second or on FaceTime, so no exceptions just cause he has prince in front of his name
1542452307727888386	@covid_lives @WizePenguin shocking..I don't understand why around 300 people each week are dying from covid..and that many again in ICU..don't the vax work..what about these wonder viral pills...are they elderly people in aged care..so many people...only a few wearing masks..is this what the Gov. wants?
1408558475593105414	@SeanRossSapp Man, do I feel that so much. I got COVID last year while teaching, and was in the hospital for all of two days. After insurance covered what they do I was left with a $40,000 bill. Worked with the hospital best I could but I owe $20,000. Our system is broken.Best wishes to you!
1526568525577453568	"Last week, working offsite, only one with a mask.This week, work emails everyone, ""We have a positive COVID case from [site], get tested!""Yeah. Looks like it finally got me."
1475685993952935936	When I got COVID I had the SLIGHTEST of symptoms during my 2nd week of quarantining. Still didn’t test negative until the end of that week (abt. 16 days after I started getting symptoms / tested positive) Can’t imagine who I would have exposed if I didn’t quarantine that long…
1479346813463367685	@GBNEWS I think people seem to be forgetting that @DjokerNole has previously tested positive for COVID-19 and recovered. So why would he take a vaccine he doesn’t know the long term side effects of, for a virus that didn’t bother him?https://t.co/VUaeiEPlUP
1444611627647705093	Interesting anecdotal data regarding a @ucddublin one large program cohort of about 300.So far 1 confirmed covid case has been present at a lecture for each week of this term.By which I mean, confirmed to have been present and shedding prior to symptomatic and diagnosed.
1471666376305692678	@Matt79213 @RuiterWrongFAN Hey dumba$$, why do I know people that have died days after getting the vaccine?  Why do I know a girl only 22  in ICU with Covid and is fully vaxxed? You are a sheep. This doesn’t reduce anything besides brain cells of liberals. Not much there as it is.

1386995560595460096	@TooSly4u2 @AGHamilton29 @benshapiro I was recently hospitalized for just your normal run of the mill virus. other things besides COVID can cause trouble. Yet, we never even worried about it before. We lived our lives to the fullest while taking risk daily.
1363957773487202308	I don't know. I'm a doctor. To me, measuring effects of opening on children when they have no vaccine protection is highly unethical. Multiple risks: new variants more infectious to children, the number of those admitted to hospital&amp;the long Covid children, overall risk to  R..
1508987396448301063	@SethDillon I did see it in a movie. This is same sample that said 59% of the ppl that got Covid were sent to the hospital, so there is that
1410710209182502914	@WUTSTHEBIGHIDEA @MSNBC @NBCNews I never said that in any of my tweets. I was making an OBSERVATION. How people with the vaccine was diagnosed with COVID..
1463037223603826689	This is what I did for 1 month at home when diagnosed with tachycardia. Dr. said I probably have crowd anxiety, takut nak jumpa orang sebab COVID since my ECG, blood test results semua okay.
1505038358036336640	first covid, then jimin and his appendicitis, now jinnie and his finger :( i hope there will be no more reasons to be hospitalized, poor babies ☹️
1300959303612985344	Don't know if this is relevant but I met someone today, 66 years old, who was diagnosed with Covid.The detail that clicked was that 10 days prior to his hospitalization he had a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Is it just a coincidence?
1482650555054919680	Despite taking all the necessary precautions I have tested Covid Positive yesterday. Besides a light fever I am otherwise fine. I am self isolating at home as per the directions of the concerned authorities. I wish for all of you to stay safe. Mask at all times and take care.
1381624956098916357	Would really fucking appreciate it if my boss, who recently had COVID, and has since been re-exposed to it when his wife tested positive, would stop coming into my workspace, maskless to boot
1487052695391375366	@twitsmylife @ijb19662 @NickTriggle Yes you're right that might reduce case numbers. I don;'t think test positivity changed suddenly around that date though? play Fig 5 here: https://t.co/E5JnKC8R2jThink ppl more likely to report positive LFTs than -ve ones, and will do for Covid passes, work requirements etc?
1419309300485402626	Im confused. They wouldn’t test me at the hospital prior to delivery because I had covid in the past 90 days due to the possibility of another positive test. Why have they not considered that? I feel for this guy. It is not his year!

1478753662226866181	COVID is real. Don’t argue with me. My 2 year old has tested positive. Please for the love of science and the safety of us all, get the shots which reduces transmission, slows development of variants, and ultimately is the only thing that will end the pandemic.

1376709085366611968	@hey_big_guy Flawed thinking on my part, that if the vaccine makes you have some side effects maybe it could cause you to test positive. Not that it would make you sick. They did say it could make an antibody test appear positive but not a covid test. ☹️

1469735079236751363	@billfromcanada2 @celliottability The other flaw is the faulty pcr test which has been used to diagnose cause of illness as covid if i understand correctly. The fact that a huge part of those in the hospital and ICU are unknowns does not help the issue either. The data is very misleading.
1384605860983230473	@clairermassey Vaccine builds the Immune system  .... I didn't have to go into hospital , but effects lasted until I got the Vaccine. For anyone that thinks because they had Covid they don't need the Vaccine , THEY SHOULD TAKE IT !!!

1516896179182702592	@PeterAnthony96 @RussellTOB Same here Peter.  Buck Showater is not managing tonight because of a minor medical condition he has to be hospitalized for.  His Head Bench Coach is out with COVID.  This is what I read at 10:30am.  So, naturally VEGAS has us as the underdogs. I believe Basset (sic) will be great
1490709676606070794	@blahman24 @carolstarr017 @jannarden I guess you can’t fix stupid because you are stupid !   And if you get Covid and end up in Hospital because your not vaccinated then you should have to pay for it out of your own pocket !
1481608588678283266	i tested positive :( FOR HAVING SWAG HAHA-no but really i got covid god damnit
1380327276311633920	@csborch @genethelawyer Funny thing I had my 1st shot on 1/26 with no side effects &amp; then tested positive for Covid on 2/4. Had my 2nd shot on 2/26 but my only side effect was the sore arm.
1467333118164090883	"@jsz2017 @tedcruz I know several people who tested positive for Covid, they were ""vaccinated"" those not vaccinated are fine....."
1455915902671654922	@HENRYTATEWILLIA @novemberrain73 @Hummingbird1314 @RBReich Everyone in our family have been vaccinated yet all just got back our latest covid test, and all our tests came back positive. And are in real bad shape. Tell me again the pluses of getting vaccinated?
1606776845994713090	@garethicke Had a text message from the boss saying he tested positive for covid! I’m like why the fuck you testing and you probs caught it of me but I never tested it’s a flu🤷🏻‍♂️😂
1470351965485998080	@ImShakeyJake Im sure its around 63% in English hospitals. If jab was working surely it would be vaccine free people in % majority in hospital. Ask yourself the question why are more people in hospitals with covid19 who have been jabbed?
1479155564324311041	@pulte It would be a blessing if u could help me and my kids life has  been so hard lately and now yesterday I was diagnosed with COVID so now we have To quarantine for 5 days I pray this shall pass too 🙏🏽 🙏🏽🙏🏽 Thankyou for the opportunity @pulte $antoineeddington https://t.co/ZUOqzkz2NS
1474539319369080833	@HollieGotWood Good... luckily not had a positive covid test again yet...most people I know have either yesterday or today!! All set to goto mums tomorrow 😃
1425498363164823557	@NorthSideCapper @1ofakndLizzy @CP24 Does the vaccine prevent you from getting COVID? YesAt an efficacy rate of 95% and with 10 million fully vaccinated in the province, unless you can show me 500,000 fully vaccinated people who have tested positive, we aren't seeing evidence the vaccine is not doing as intended.
1382487371992735744	@estikat @DarkRose2885 I have had Covid ... as has many I know. I do not know one person who has gone to hospital or died from it.  I am not sure I believe a word you say
1380245297075523589	I bought a desktop fan from Gumtree, and the guy's just texted me to tell me he's tested positive for COVID.Luckily, the fan can self-oscillate
1393729887626739712	@Watertankkitty @MrLEE72390742 @Vadid65 I spoke to someone who works on the admissions ward I used to work on. No busier than usual now. One small ward in the hospital is a covid ward. Tests are done patients present at hospital. Negatives go where they need to go, positives go to the covid ward.
1478015862040891394	Lmao I emailed my manager yesterday to tell her I tested positive for Covid and she just emailed me this morning asking if I could come in to cover a shift today. (I don’t usually work Mondays and she doesn’t check her emails very often)
1469400723511291906	@Chrisboop22 @JeffcoPH @JeffcoSchoolsCo @Jusrangers The policy is absolutely discriminatory. My vaxed 14 y/o was allowed to attend school for 2 days while living with 3 Covid positive family members. (She tested positive the 3rd day.) Quarantine rules should not be based on vax status. It makes no sense.
1516607625156128776	yes I’m triple vaxxed &amp; yes I still got Covid &amp; yes I’m booking my 4th dose.  I’d rather spend a week sick in bed than a month in ICU or worse.  Thanks for coming to my TED talk
1374734022128119815	@TPCarney My child has been back in school for six weeks we got the call that a classmate tested positive and to get our kids tested I got the results today my child has Covid 😞
1342183633243824130	@jasonleitch I asked yourself a question earlier.If someone received vaccine 1 week how can they test positive for Corona a week later
1351521885960491018	@ArielleCalvo I think the vaccine uses a covid-like type of substance, not actually covid 19, so those who get vaccines shouldn't test positive because of it. (From what I've gathered)
1428154339252531200	@ConApocalypse @WllmTell @USMortality As others note, your math is off 100x.I'd also like to point out that the 2/Million is for those that get COVID with enough symptoms that they test positive for it. That ignores those that are exposed to it and fight it off with minimal or no symptoms.#NoMasksInClass
1485375879908044800	I still hold to my previous views.Recording positive rapid test results help to better track spread.But hospitalisation and intensive care admissions are the most important cases to look at. Australia COVID: NSW, Victoria virus cases may be plateauing https://t.co/8Ip9XRY9uG
1578339400622055424	Do I have to worry going out if my Covid quick test is five days after the end of the quarantine still positive?
1418322701819645952	When you control the PCR tests you can make covid spike whenever you want. I can test a lemon and probably get a positive result for the delta variant.
1487052153592111104	@jimbraude @nytimes @GreaterBoston @MargeryEagan @MayorWu vaccines do not stop transmission or infection and now https://t.co/sSNKey5YxZ reports “fully vaccinated” make up the majority of the of Covid hospitalized patients. Please tell me again why we must get vaccinated? https://t.co/0ksDo3lZ1m
1432288473520779267	Or does this suggest the high starting point for cases, deaths, hospital admissions and in hospital with Covid will really test the narrative ( one I totally agree with) that we must live with Covid?  I cannot believe Australia and New Zealand are still so restricted
1619795390626422787	Got home from IkkiCon and tested positive for Covid Tuesday morning. Spent the week in bed only finally having the will to work yesterday when I sat and mindlessly opened rings while listening to a book. Today tested Negative! Till a little slow, but yay prepped rings for tails! https://t.co/psOqAdSj6G
1382248693567418368	I got tested positive for covid today. pray for me. /srs
1379205009225744384	I’ve been quarantining in my office at home the last few days after (thankfully) being the only person to test positive for Covid and my wife has been bringing me meds, preparing food, and taking care of our 4 month old completely by herself and I’m so damn thankful for her.
1435947985481854982	@SaccadeLife @sloth_dc @DavidAnber I had covid from aug 19. I started with intense fatigue and on aug 20 I had fever with chills that lasted until aug 22. Aug 23 I lost my sense of smell and taste. Aug 25-30 I had very difficult breathing and had to go to the hospital.
1451572706189529092	@timohara3 @usclefty @ArtDirectorBYU @wilnerhotline Don’t disagree that unvaxxed are ending up in the hospital far more than the vaxxed. Just don’t think a person should be forced to vax, especially if they’ve already had Covid. I want everyone to vax but I don’t worry about my own health cause I’m vaxxed.
1476052009283432448	This is why i got covid vaccine. I know some people dont get sick enough to be hospitalized but some people arent as lucky. You just never know! I can’t miss work &amp; pay the hospital &amp; didnt want to risk my heath w/ possible long term issues or die. #COVID19 https://t.co/ObQ1fcBZjW
1529859444879810561	@SherlocksSpring @JohnnyCHolmes And most of them catch covid in the hospital then at home.I lost 3 members of my extended family who were admitted for a different condition, caught covid in the hospital and died alone,without family Heartbreaking. Hence my stand on this. Hats off to @KirstieMAllsopp. 🙏🙏🙏
1484252149144039426	Well fuck! Half the house have tested positive for Covid and I sit here listening to the time bomb slowly ticking away!
1331743030097874944	@NeilDotObrien NOT DEATH FROM COVID BUT COVID MENTIONED ON DEATH CERTIFICATE. Or a positive test within 28 days all to suit big pharma vaccine money tree.  We need information in who is making money from vaccines, my money is in ockdown fanatics (MPs) and the scientific advisors. Inquiry needed https://t.co/UavNrbXow0
1435996055598940168	@KiwiFlesh @HopeInTheUSA @caitoz It’s literally impossible for anybody to know how many people have died from COVID-19 but I guarantee it’s less than the official number because hospitals are paid money based on how many COVID deaths they report having without so much as a positive test required
1432683140464664585	@seacatspot @GovRonDeSantis How are these data collected? Cases: A Pcr test that can be made positive in its nature? Death: What is the definition of a corona death ? Dying with corona = dying of corona ? How is it count ?Can someone tell me that i can't seem to find it, i am not smart thats why i ask
1417115661516558343	Covid story: ‘My 6-month baby tested positive along with me’ https://t.co/UdO0GNfBp4
1537288522851393538	Okay for people who's had #covid... I tested positive today but I've been having my symptoms for 4 days already.. When should I be in the clear??#Omicron
1552358257888415744	@WaversFlag I only tested positive for 8 days so YES, he's over COVID because we had the vaccines and boosters! Not to mention this devoted man has never stopped doing his job!
1451543940893601795	@eastofadelaide @CBCNews The hospital numbers were faked- i know many people working in different hospitals across Alberta. When we were in a crisis, most patients in the hospital were either the double vaxxed, or people there for completely unrelated reasons. From the start, covid cases were inflated
1427389726995189762	@johnrich  You may or may not know, both Mark Chesnutt and his wife, Tracie, have been diagnosed with Covid and he is recuperating from back surgery. I sure hope they will be okay.
1394839398361956355	@ReelTalker Am Arun From INDIA, My wife (27yrs)is critically ill and admitted in hospital ICU (PAST 36 DAYS)due to serious infection,brain damage which not related to Covid. On this situation,any contribution will help us fight the situation. https://t.co/yXJMnRLQ62 https://t.co/p7K2WHaXjj
1382445014836469765	@funder I can't figure it out.  The only people coming down with hospitalized Covid are the people not getting vaccinated.
1385025457389723654	@WashedupMXER Potentially. Not an expert on the numbers but people have asked how many are ending up in hospital after getting the shot or getting COVID, so I asked for the numbers.
1429539401592418326	@JOjebuoboh @AProdigiosus @UFOwillie I have know 6 people that had it. None were hospitalized. Even the CDC states that people in my age demographic have a 99% chance of survival.  As a matter of fact I am more likely to die in a car accident on my way to get the vaccine than I am if I catch Covid-19 again. Fact.
1501283696632029190	@cineworld I’ve contacted your customer services to no avail. I’m trying to get a refund for #TheBatman  because a member of the group tested positive for covid however I am not receiving a refund and was turned down by the customer services.
1443332628917129216	At least 2 family members so far that I was at a wedding with this past weekend have tested positive for covid. I fucking hate this timeline
1480682547961118727	Oh no, please don't tell me this is going to be the narrative around this. He's an egotistic man who either faked a COVID test or willingly spread the virus because of his recklessness after testing positive. It's not a redemption story, it's about the huge ego of this man.
1424993961723170817	I got the J&amp;J vaccine in Feb. I had a headache and rigors for about a day then felt better after panado and a nap. I’ve since come in close contact with many people who tested positive for COVID in my family and remained well.
1388957833379516417	@AlliNutrition @MySuccessTheory @AlliNutrition I am a great believer in Schusslers Bio salts that come in homoepathy format.Recently I was in ICU for Covid. During this time I called 12 bio salts. Magnesium Phosphate is one of the principal salts that (after reading your thread) helped my rapid recovery
1388954817209454597	@kristofergpitts @weatherguy2020 That's crazy, i have corona and they just put some extra Single use clothes on and masks + goggles in the hospital and at the X-ray specialist to check my lungs
1374733998266720257	someone at my work was tested positive for covid. should I fake symptoms so I get paid time off?
1466160650690965507	#TyphoidTrump that Friday he went in to the hospital with Covid I put 2+2 together. Shows up late couldn't take a test,his family entered maskless days before he refused protective shield for debate
1374772164226867202	Slept like shit last night, my stomach is in knots and I'm just sitting here at work pretending to be busy sipping chicken broth hoping to feel better...also our new Admin just said someone at her church tested positive for COVID so yay 🙄
1386452588233646082	@FoxNews The only problem I have with this kind of data, no one ever reports the number actually tested when they start talking about COVID rates going up or down. If fewer people are getting tested, then that might explain why positive results are down.
1554082611454246917	@OhBeing @HeyNurseKat @sarahbeth345 @maggiemfox Simce watching mandatory n95s fail in Bavaria, I invented the n97+, which is a fitted n95 + two surgical masks sprayed with scotch guard. I tested it on two Covid positive hairdressers 5 days after they were most contagious and it had 100% efficacy of lowering blood oxygen. https://t.co/sXOtW6SpbT
1455189912286683136	@rick_pittman I had a T cell test done and it came back positive of having covid. May have been a few times I thought I had it. I recovered. I’m 66 and have natural immunity.
1417895115679440900	@NHSuk How come everybody in my house who got vaccinated became ill and tested positive with Covid but I didn’t without taking it - and I isolated WITH them the whole time
1484183996095352834	@wisteruias i just tested positive for covid so i’m dying! but how are you bestie????🥰🥰🥰🥰
1522295785509081091	Doc visit today as I’m not feeling well. Was informed 3 vaccinated people tested positive for covid. 4 streptococcus and 2 flu. I didn’t know the flu existed any longer. Still waiting on my results
1487196819025182730	Today me,my wife and my helper all tested positive for Covid and they sent us all home with no medication,we all know there’s medication that helps with Covid so why wouldn’t they give us something? if it’s not needed then why are they pushing the vaccine so hard for everybody🤷🏽‍♂️
1549808372312117248	2 weeks work left and I test positive for big dog corona :p
1488108828092768257	@alexander_olly NOOO Olly!! 😭😭😭I’ve tested positive for Covid. I was coming to see you twice at Leeds, London &amp; Southampton. Heartbroken doesn’t come close to describing how I feel. 💔💔💔 https://t.co/JJWnQS46VH
1490736149320458243	@xTheTruthXl @cochraf @cmac1004 @AmitAryaMD What if vaccination rates were 99% . I’m confident people still dying of coronaviruses and hospitalized. Do we keep this charade going? No end? #mandatesmustend
1475594736412938240	Most drug stores are saying they are will be out of covid tests thru next week, so the plus side is that positive test rates will decline. I guess this is proof that ignorance can be bliss.
1409137207235985409	So my mum has 3 covid tests before going in hospital to have some of her lung cut off to take the cancer away today she coming home and now has covid how the fuk do you catch it in there
1448397503250845699	Update: tested positive for Covid 🤒 Mario tested negative. I will be doing nothing but resting so sorry about the lack of content 💖
1483225604900237319	just tested positive for having a thicc juicy fat assand also covid so if you’ve been around me within the past week you should probably go get tested 😣

1464882867368960005	Sure only hot bitches get Pfizer but did you make out with someone who then later tested positive for covid and was fine?I didnt think so... Put some respect on Dolly Parton's name!
1510664927198994434	@Tesco Hi,  I’ve got a delivery tonight and I’ve tested positive for Covid today so couldn’t put anything last night when I checked out. Could you let the store know if I drop over my order details etc.
1427800727674494982	Mason tested positive for covid and my boss really told me “don’t go and try to get sick now” LOL HATE JT HERE
1469736625441841162	@mark_toshner Am not sure @mark_toshner We don’t want to see in hospital transmission like in first wave- but I think we will be stuck… with no staff…. I can understand the appeal - but it will be at the expense of passing Covid to other patients and staff…. Is there a way round? Daily PCR?
1447968564116344837	@rollforlearning @laura___black How many are actually very sick?  Just curious because both my kids have had Covid (age 3 and 6). Positive test, barely a fever for a day. They've been MUCH MUCH sicker Pre-Covid - influenza to them is a greater risk - should we start closing schools post-Covid for everything?
1356562557482524672	Up to 22 cases now that I personally have knowledge of where folks get the vaccine, 7-10 days later develop COVID symptoms, test positive by PCR.  Protein spikes created by the vaccine lead to symptoms and a + test.  Proof that PCR testing is bogus.  🤓
1380506433666621444	well, my boyfriend tested positive for covid &amp; I feel like shit as well so I’m 99% sure I got it 😭
1464902843748466692	@samgosling92 @reuschfootball @DrRanj The scaremongering covid briefings you mean, if I test positive today and get hit by a train in 2 weeks down, because it’s within the 28 days, I’m added to the covid deaths… how is there any logic?
1379511628807368705	I got sick af this weekend. Ended up going to the Er for the first time ever. Taking it easy. Atleast I still have never had Covid 🙏🏽
1425304455310888966	hey guys, so i tested positive for covid today :/ please keep my nana in your thoughts &amp; prayers. i hope to god she doesn’t have it too

1349088015809826819	@CDCgov @US_FDA Question! I was diagnosed w/ Covid Dec. 2nd. I received my Moderna vaccine December 28th with a good fever and body aches after. Do I get the second shot? I hear now you should wait 90 days. Please help!?
1428735887001718789	@AdamG620 @thx1138_v2 @josephenicholas @ianbremmer Death-counting convention for covid is markedly different than for flu.It is unlikely to happen, but I'd like to see positive PCR test for flu and then deaths within 30 days to see the result.Age stratification and comorbitities also cast doubt on covid true death count.
1385982059764756486	getting my second COVID shot today, and between that, the emergency-use antiviral, the convalescent plasma, and the litany of x-rays and other scans I went through while in the hospital, I’m now just over here waiting for my superpowers to kick in
1530481498490830848	@johngbennett My 13month old tested positive to COVID yesterday via PCR unexpectedly 🤦Wife tested negative to COVID but positive to influenza A and common cold yesterday for a work test 😳So my house has the trifecta 🤣
1481437091762429956	Well....the back to school for my oldest lasted a whole 2 days.A kid in his class was diagnosed with COVID so he now goes into 5 day isolation and we pray now that he didn't catch it or all 6 of us likely will get it.Fun times. 😞😞😞
1557879335125716992	@sleepinmoneyJR She was more upset about having somebody in the hospital having a baby and she wasn’t vaccinated, she also said and I think she got Covid, I don’t know if they are going to make it..?!?!  She said I don’t know why people don’t get vaccinated 😖
1384686756407218176	@PatriotAJGhost @DoraDallas6 How does he know what the levels of infection are when the testing is completely flawed. You cans swab a piece of fruit &amp; get a positive result. How does he know how many people died OF Covid vs WITH Covid. I know if people who died in car crashes who were listed as Covid deaths
1558631211282575360	@ahandvanish I'm both. I had postviral illness for 15years before I got covid in the first waveBut I'm telling you, it's a whole different experience being told, stay home, don't come to the ER and breathe on us. Hope you live.
1446451337332465665	@PhillipsTony21 @SirRudolf714 @bluegrass1111 My data parallels to Franks. I personally know people who got sick with Covid, went into the hospital and never came out. I do not know one anyone that this has happened to who’s been vaccinated. I’m not telling people what to do, but I know what I know.

1481792583789527045	@someraindrop695 @britneyspears I had COVID in 2020.  Tested positive, told to isolate, and come in immediately if symptoms worsened (very high fever, difficulty breathing, etc.).

1474121380534833157	@LomaahhMore @Ghousematt @doingmyownnails @donwinslow @DevonESawa If she asked for the sports bra, then it is acceptable right? The scarf is from a very nice store, and I cannot exchange anything as I have tested positive for covid ! So whats done is done now !
1437456972123680773	How is @HiltonHotels not modifying its cancellation &amp; refund policies given Covid? The representative I just spoke with would much rather have people who have recently tested positive for Covid show up then extend me a refund for my trip…How is that keeping safety in mind?
1461765043821977601	@ArcadeJames7 @MrTwinSister22 @SirajAHashmi Last I checked; 93% of hospitalized COVID cases were unvaxxed. So your risk of hospitalization if unvaxxed is 13x greater than if you are.
1376547132182822920	People forgetting that it takes 2-14 days for a positive covid test makes me really not want to go to work rn
1522684005434462209	@Berettadetta I love and appreciate you but the question “still covid?” when I literally only tested positive like 2 days ago has me in tears
1417572501492748291	@ABC7 Give me a number. Not percentages. 95 people out of 100 that are hospitalized are unvaccinated. Or 47 out of 50. It could be .002 of the population in the OC is an unvaccinated patient of covid in the hospital as of today. Give me numbers.
1464557474724384772	@LBC 61 passengers coming from South Africa tested positive for covid at the airport. I thought people could not get on a plane without a negative test. Or are people travelling with false test results?

1424886107653775364	Desk get a care package to her that included her phone charger so I can keep her up to date with videos and pictures of her dogs. But as someone who has had covid I would sign a liability waiver or whatever other form necessary to get in and spend time with her, in the hospital
1435578750788243458	"@KelioCristiano @zhang_schmidt Sure, then we'd have a whole lot of people dying of ""something else"", bad flu or some shit, but...we don't? I have 1500 or so contacts, if we had US COVID levels, three should be dead and a lot more in the hospital. They aren't?"
1422389513515675664	I am NOT ready for another wave of COVID in the hospital and it’s happening ☹️
1487443506197110785	@NikNak722 She tested covid positive last Monday. I missed it then, but when I noticed I hadn't seen her in a bit, I looked back and saw it. She started feeling a sore throat and stuffy on the 15th, tested pos on the 17th. Not good in her already compromised condition.
1509280189733343238	@talk2oleary @fordnation I wonder if those in the hospital battling covid, the immunocompromised, babies &amp; children under 5, elderly,those battling this illness at home, or fighting long covid, those unable to visit family because of outbreaks, I wonder if they are thinking about the lake?#VoteFordOut
1311927181635989505	@WearingisCaring @DrTedros Let me say this one more time for clarity! The vast majority of the deaths were from OTHER CAUSES! they were then tested for covid after death using a defective test method that shows everyone as a positive! You are being lied to!! All this to push an unproven RNA vaccine!
1374843201903861760	@tahoerimriders The pastor &amp; wife, of my church are immune compromised, bigly. He asked the congregation at the beginning of Pandemic to follow CDC guidelines &amp; wear masks. Cooperation = 0. Not one mask. 8 months later, the pastor is in the ICU w COVID symptoms, Afib, &amp; kidney failure.
1485683660997070849	@ChottoDragon Gib one plz 🥺 I also tested positive for Covid so we are covid buddies
1485601480170258434	Yesterday I tested positive for Covid. Yet, I had felt my first symptoms — a scratchy throat and a mild dry cough — three days earlier. (2/13)
1447493448852860929	was diagnosed btw with illness anxiety disorder which has been bad prior to the start of the pandemic but has escalated things and has made it very stressfulby this account i thought i had covid, thought i was having a heart attack TWICE, thought i had heart issues for months
1392468347103506438	@jackowills22 @Christi75298275 @neiltyson Take the hospital where I’m working at. 80% of ICU beds taken up by covid patients. People are still falling ill. Heart attacks, massive stroke, bacterial pneumonia, car accidents. Strain in capacity limits access of others into ICU. They receive suboptimal care and end up dying.
1379555077938163712	@ApplauseSv @POTUS I got diagnosed with covid today
1555830247865606144	@DrJenGunter I tested positive for the first time since Covid started a day after returning from California. I got infected a few days before, apparently. I flew with KLM. Which airline were you flying with?
1384220301890711552	My weed dealer--who I JUST SAW--just let me know that he and his gf both tested positive for COVID. Trying to remember if there's anything left I need to do before I shuffle off this mortal coil.Anybody know where I can score an Ordelan?😂🤣
1519171274039255040	@TheLeoTerrell Let me guess: “but thankful for the vaccine 🤮blah blah blah. Be sure to get yourselves the shots and boosters, blah blah blah”. NOPE!! Never had one shot. The only way I know I had Covid was I gave blood and they tested it and found I was positive. No symptoms at all though.
1384170818154815498	Just got information about Dr.Manmohan Singh having tested COVID positive. Prayers of every Indian are with you sir, I wish you a speedy recovery.#GetWellSoon #DrManMohanSingh @PManmohansingh
1482849835015602178	All set to do a COVID safe visit to my family near Ballina in northern NSW this coming weekend - we were taking extra time and making it a 5 day event since we hadn't seen them since Oct '20 - and now my nephew's childcare has a positive case and everyone has to test and isolate
1386450943802236936	@aliciaben @Amy_Siskind See, I want to get the shots. However, I had Covid last month, and have been advised to wait 90 days from my positive test. I’m worried about supply when I can get it.
1443344758865338368	"@GBNEWS ""Hello. Could I see your vaccine status?""""Certainly. As you can see I am double vaxxed, despite currently testing positive for COVID. Did you also want to see my HIV, TB, Hep B &amp; flu status?""""No, in you come. We aren't bothered about any of these or your positive COVID test"""
1562844647642107904	@MrsPitbull I was diagnosed with Covid 19 a couple days ago.  Was very sick, but am getting over it  I am very thankful I never got the shot nor boosters.  I am certain it would have been much worse with them.
1557849269247348736	@shannonmichele_ Man…hopefully it’s some random ass bug that goes away. I just had COVID a few weeks ago and I had the BAD one that almost had me in the ER. Only reason I didn’t go was because I was stubborn.
1586448440392749056	Tested positive for COVID 😩😩 Unlucky timing just prayge I’m negative by the finals. But gonna try not to stress about it because I will spiral. Hope I have some banger series to watch!
1489168565043281926	@MJ_Leaver Very hard. I'm trying to give up too. But on the stop day mum (who lives with us) broke her hip and is in hospital having surgery. No visitors due to Covid. I'm a bit of a wreck. But I'm committed to giving up for good. We. Can. Do. This.
1470833127237074946	@DotcomRussell @JohnTyndall1934 @darrengrimes_ That is your opinion, I prefer to check facts myself. He has a very valid point, as the methodology to count COVID deaths in England has been utterly shocking. To start with, literary anyone that tested positive with COVID and died at some point, was counted as COVID death. https://t.co/CSWNVZETOF
1481190714264412161	@bezzzles @BBCNews That's the number who died within 28 data of a positive test, not the number that died because of COVID. That actual figure is being hidden from us as far as I can tell.
1419708685681635338	@jacobslavin @GrandKidBlessed @DrRobDavidson @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Yes, genius, because not everyone is going to get it - it’s not 100% transmissible - and she has a positive Covid test and I’m sure is keeping her family safe by sequestering. Duh.
1482723480596529152	@christufton My understanding is  an  individual who  is diagnosed with  covid19 is  given  5 days  sick leave, how was that  number  arrived at given different varieties of the  virus out there with  varying impacts ?
1353121239481470981	not someone working in the ER casually telling me while ringing her up that she got her covid vaccine but also that another wave of covid is coming...GO HOME PLS🥴
1370549343586037762	@Scott89ttocS @SkyNews So if I test positive by fraudulent 45 cycle PCR test and then get hit by a bus 27 days later the cause of death is definitely Covid 19. But if I have an anaphylactic shock after taking a brand new untested vaccine it's no way the vaccine at fault. Yeah? #DoubleStandardsMuch?
1418569942614650883	@Hemmels @jengleruk Anything I've read suggests the at home deaths were people having strokes and heart attacks &amp; delaying going to hospital out of fear of Covid.
1421406064298364928	@CoinyThommy @spinte8 I know a few who died. Many of my staff are coming down with Covid (in their 20s), one ended up in hospital a week ago. Im still living my life, but pretending there’s no risk is dumb in my eyes.
1405526529879154691	Ok, I am on glue…right?School has a Yr 2 pupil test positive for Covid so all Yr 2 pupils have to go home and self isolate. I get that! However…If a Yr 2 pupil has siblings, they don’t need to go home early or stay home. Can someone please tell me what sense this makes?
1443258946303627265	@IPL Btw....T Natarajan was tested positive for covid19 few days before i guess.What's his status now???Haven't heard anything about him since he tested positive.
1382061208262574090	@SaleyhaAhsan @GMB last week I was diagnosed with COPD,I now can't take my health for granted,and covid has made everyone think our health like a planet needs looking after and care.I'll look out for you 🌙🌍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿

1479431502802866179	@mscouten @MCPS My 7yr old tested positive for COVID outside of school on 12/17/2021 and even though I’m fully vaccinated and boosted I also had it. We both didn’t leave home for 10 days. He felt better after 3 days fully recovered in 5 took me 7 days to feel better. We should have both options

1614107938125119489	@Annabel_Jones_ @JamesMelville Let’s not get into it. People were not dying of Covid, they were dying of the treatment protocols and being shoved onto ventilators. I’ve also followed hospital numbers in my area &amp; there are never more than a few Covid patients in ICU at any time so that’s being totally…
1395963352497545216	If i was a doctor and if i could, I would gladly welcome someone like this  into the hospital but when they get covid, refuse treatment because hey u said covid was not real!

1427590890290302983	@TomPJacobs @Erdayastronaut @matthewchauvin7 I wouldn't worry TOO much about it, take all precautions necessary in order for you to feel safe if you feel like that may be right. If you somehow catch COVID, you probably won't end up in the hospital

1381429270661193735	@reddusfoximus @ruggierocpa Yeah, my wife was Covid positive. A month and a half later she har antibody test was negative. Avoid the vaccine at your own risk...
1522546451599044608	@MayorKateRogers @chiefallanjr For the love of Christ, how hard is it to wear a mask?

1477533611851190274	@calvinrobinson So if they arrive they get tested, and if they are tested they are automatically counted as hospitalized with Covid. Jesus-it’s a failsafe way to push the numbers. I can not get my brain around how obvious the BS is!
1377836387785875463	@KITV4 I had covid last March - at the time testing was only available for those being hospitalized.  I tested positive for antibodies in June, finally confirming the diagnosis.   First Pfizer shot resulted in only mild discomfort at injection site.
1386998793388888070	@SagittaVeritat1 @AnnJTerry @NickFerrariLBC Exactly that! I know 3 family members who went into hospital for various reasons other than Covid, plus members who have regular treatments in outpatients which all carried on during the pandemic #IstandwithNHSstaff plus all different areas of the country
1510667384054435842	@MalwareJake I was amazed at how many people denied COVID even while they were in the hospital with it.I’ve learned a lot since 2016.
1437813017199185928	@NEAToday Quercetin quickly cured COVID symptoms in about 100 consecutive high-risk patients. Of the 2 who were hospitalized and died, neither increased his dose of quercetin as requested. My 1st patient's response was dramatic:https://t.co/4gMkLP1R41It's safe enough for kids.
1584277140664881152	@nmcdonell1 @PearlUSAfreedom @JoeTalkShow It filled because the corporations started playing God. The last prescription he write was for a 27 year old who prior to Covid had been extremely healthy. This was the only patient of his who landed in the hospital. So, I’d definitely take it if needed.
1381833566745583616	@sandra_gr I was hospitalized for two weeks with COVID last August
1476209963492167681	@murdo_fraser  just asked the FM the question I most want to know, how many  people in hospital with Covid had NOT been vaccinated. She didn't have those figures at hand more's the pity , as I'm sure the answer wouldn't help the call for everyone to get the jab!
1464992529418436611	Misinformation after misinformation. The one thing I will say is the vaccine has shown to prevent u going to the hospital if you get covid. Other than that the lies upon lies the Americans have been spoon fed is unreal and these people need to be held accountable.
1582908633553448960	Close contact testing positive for covid immediately made me panic for hours today that I got it.Tested negative, and almost immediately my congestion cleared.Our minds are funny places.

1438574134498316288	@FiorediNotte33 @NationalFile It’s not Deceiving, but I’ll admit she worded it poorly. She’s talking about reporting the number of non-Covid patients in the hospital alongside Covid patients. She’s trying to convey to the community how full the hospital is so they understand the gravity of the situation.

1385708334204993538	@RealCarlVernon @RotoRooter36 Screw Biden and fauci! I have been mask free for over a year and not once have I ever tested positive for covid. And not one person has ever said a word to me about not wearing a stupid mask. People that wear masks are idiots that cater to stupider people. Masks are subzero IQ's.
1568264531792773121	The day before @DragonCon started I tested positive for covid. So we didn't go. Now they won't rollover our badges. They'd literally rather have someone spread covid at the con than be the least bit accommodating. #dragoncon #DragonCon2022 #DCon #DCon2022 #conventions #cosplay
1344310132277211137	@WDRBNews I hope this headline wasn't structured intentionally to suggest that the vaccine caused his positive covid test...I could certainly see some readers taking it that way.
1362838092953042949	@RedisBlunt I don't feel a need to as COVID went through my wife's work &amp; she tested positive (with not much more than a bad cold &amp; some tiredness).While I never got tested I'm sure I was exposed (since I don't socially distance from my wife).Accordingly it seems dumb to get the vaccine.
1332816508322537475	@corney_comey @LdicassioLorri @3days3nights I received my flu shot from my VA Home Health Care Nurses, and my Shingles vaccine. I am not worried. Two of my Grandkids, one from each of my 2 kids. I hugged and kissed on them, didn’t catch it. Out of 8 people, only 2 kids got COVID19, symptoms and positive COVID19 test result

1454140765173542914	I still don’t know anyone who has had covid.  Who are all these people testing positive? Are the same people continuously getting tested? I just don’t get it.

1483700430450597891	I've tested positive for COVID with mild symptoms. I have quarantined myself at home and taking all the necessary precautions. I would request those who came in contact with me to get themselves tested at the earliest. Please be safe and take care.🙏
1556169944382980096	@siphophiri It's possible, just that I think we have mild cases not needing hospitalisation, so it's not getting as much attention and people are treating themselves from home, assuming it's flu. If they tested, they would most likely be positive for Covid.
1415158819273854978	@kanak_news @IPR_Odisha @HFWOdisha Only covid positive number are showing. No body is ready to give covid-19 positive testing report. Specially in Balasore district. I tested positive but unable to get report. Please help me.

1416855832147464194	@mayoroflasvegas a mask mandate? Really? Politicians are clueless! This kind of nonsense will only make people realize that the vaccines are useless. We do know that many people that got the vax have tested positive for covid. I’m canceling my trip ✅ #notfun
1479994061360611331	My family has been relatively lucky throughout the pandemic. But two tested positive for COVID today and we're sure at least two more have it, just waiting on the results. We're sure the exposures happened at school. Everyone's quarantined and I'm fine. It's just tearing through.

1619451289947222017	@TomHowellhuman Fair on the health system capacity. Although I'm always confused by the idea that lockdowns would make capacity problems worse. During first UK lockdown, R went down to like 0.6, that meant a lot fewer people in hospital with COVID, which meant more capacity for other stuff.
1388126928939388932	@globalnews Good for you Judge . I’ve Been saying that for a long time . Also if they get Covid to hospital treatment . Leave room for those who care .

1476685237971214337	@ImaginaryDreads Yeah he good! He’s negative now. I was sick for 23 days but I never tested positive. He got COVID from work.
1437065533669588995	@JohanSW89277634 @Jon_Slater @NightShiftMD I think the evidence is clear in the daily numbers of who is getting COVID and ends up in the ICU. I don’t doubt that vaccinated people can still spread the virus, but the case numbers show they the unvaccinated are 40 times more likely to end up in the ICU should be convincing.
1377494400016637955	@drharshvardhan I was diagnosed covid postive this Tuesday but still waiting for call from madical support. We are trapped at our house can someone look forward to us.
1388152684537057281	@LegendaryEnergy I had 3 elderly patients test positive with Covid this week all were previously vaccinated. Asymptomatic
1507148870161432576	@milehawk819 @XiMeNaKa I can get a covid test now but in March 2020 I went to the hospital twice for crushing chest pain and difficulty breathing post a week of flu like symptoms Both times the physicians refused covid tests claiming I only had the flu and with no proof my chest pain was from anxiety
1418550913959174153	As someone who had 2 family members contract covid in hospital in the early days this just gets me so angry. These are probably not just people who happened to be there for minor reasons, but folk who really had to be there. Aside from Sarah McInerney nobody has looked into this
1484619201243402245	so i saw my ex over the weekend and i thought i gave him covid and ruined his trip to vegas (#sorry) but he just tested negative today??!? and i still tested positive?!?! ITS NOT FAIR
1531144755530256384	covid rules are so dumb.  Flying to america and have a covid test they require taken maximum of 24 hours before flight.  Test positive it ruins all plans and have 0 time to change anything, test negative then i get to fly to america
1417726852735590400	So my 18yr year old has worked in a shop all through #Covid since last Aug leaving Navy &amp; before that 1 Fckin Day #NoMasks &amp; he is poorly in the night &amp; tested #positive this morning
1438924375437324290	@MrAhmednurAli I was told a Afghani Refuge flight just landed had bunch of #COVID19 and a person who hospitalized complained about how bad is the Canadian Meat in the Hospital!! And he never had such bad meat in his Life!!!
1476672331925925888	@Quea_Ali @rexglacer They are Ali, they admitted that the actual numbers in hospital are actually about half what is reported, in hospital because of Covid and in hospital for other stuff but happened to test positive are 2 different things now.  I know it’s not what you meant exactly but a start.
1378358561017896963	@thebl0w fuck yeah. I will check it out! I lived in NYC for a year right when I got diagnosed with ALS. And this is something no one ever talked about, I am really loving your posts and learning about it. Especially since everyone seemed to love Cuomo during the beginning of covid
1482349037697314816	"FIRST of all, I would never TAKE a COVID test unless forced to because I had to have elective surgery or something like that.  SECOND, if I had to take the test and had a ""positive"" showing, I sure wouldn't take any medication at all if I had no symptoms of COVID."
1376173994034929665	@rexglacer But how many people who tested positive are actually sick? And although I hate to ever defend the Liberal Party, the vaccine doesn’t prevent transmission of Covid so 🤷‍♀️
1375281099996344322	@MaddowBlog I live in rural Ohio.  I was called by my GP and county hospital after my test was positive for Covid.   They were encouraging me to get the Antibodies treatment at our hospital.  Couldn’t have been easier.  Our local medical experts rock.  Politicians on the other hand suck!
1352699624193187842	can somebody explain to me how @NFL  players getting #COVID19  on a weekly basis all season are diagnosed one week and fine the next without this vaccine available?
1474440480238628868	@EdaMagician @J0YKillah @MeghanMcCain Shall I show you how the CDC and the government is counting covid deaths? They literally are counting people who came in the ER with Covid then left and got into a car accident then counted as a covid related death. Deny that happens and I'll prove you wrong with a video!
1478776113199403008	@pulte Was in hospital on Christmas,my birthday and New Years, needing surgery and had Covid… I could use good luck. But who doesn’t right?
1440563995883159563	@DLeonhardt Rapid testing is not accurate at all. I know at least 5 people that have tested negative with the rapid test that were positive with PCR. And one went back to work and spread covid accidentally, due to inaccurate results. Rapid testing is spreading covid.
1394734360314531844	@priyankac19 Am Arun from INDIA,My wife (27yrs)is critically ill and admitted in hospital ICU (PAST 36 DAYS)due to serious infection,brain damage which not related to Covid. On this situation,any contribution will help us fight the situation. https://t.co/yXJMnRLQ62 https://t.co/nJpWlen7yf
1470378237075329024	A fully mobile patient, walk into casualty by himself, tested positive for COVID (RAPID). Me telling him to get on a stretcher so I push him to a COVID isolation ward for admission angers them. All of the sudden he can’t move, he is too sick
1484684387795062788	@Italiananger @CountyExecBello @MonroeHealth And obviously I know that some of our community members hospitalized with COVID are vaccinated, but the numbers of unvaccinated requiring care is far greater with far worse outcomes.
1532776471223230465	@HealthAllegheny If you test positive go get a Olympus Infusion. It works within 2 days you feel better. I had side effects from the vaccine for 13 months that made me have level of stress. Made me wish I would die.I tested pos.for covid. Got the Infusion 3 days ago. I feel my old self.Stressgone
1474048444079775751	everybody testing positive for Covid &amp; I’m scared to take that test now
1487138792469196804	@hardlyparty @SneakyCat411 @chicagosmayor @TimJDillon I have had covid, I have recovered, my immune system took care of it, I have natural immunity, I am not going to the hospital with this. So now what?
1387433930672934918	@lucymcaldwell I have not been sick one day of the past year. No congestion, no upset stomach. No doubt it is a result of following mitigation protocols generally. Yet, on the COVID-denier side of things, they use this information to suggest that flu is being diagnosed as COVID.
1484170328829947904	@AllisonPearson It’s because so many staff have to self isolate if a member of their family tests positive.  So far a colleague of my wife who is triply vac and has covid has had to take three weeks off of work because her children have tested positive at various times. This should be stopped.
1381106830584123393	Man I worked in the icu overnight this entire weekend and all I can say is appreciate everyday your health! Hug your loved ones.  life is sooo short especially with this virus honestly fuck covid.
1426371935806570496	I leave work for 4 days with 6 Covid patients in the entire hospital and none in the ICU… come back 4 DAYS later with 43 covid patients and 8 in the ICU intubated???????????? I literally can not mentally go through a round Fucking 3 with this virus…
1461088694270676994	In Colorado there are what over 1200 people in hospital with Covid &amp; I believe it was reported about 300 are vaccinated. Vaccines work but immunity weakens &amp; I Believe though fully vaccinated you still must use extreme caution. When masks mandates are erased &amp; social distancing
1480710926206529539	@CNN And?  The 12 of us in my immediate family all had COVID (ages 4-51) and not one of us went to the hospital.  Nor are any of us vaccinated.  Stop trying to push your hysteria on others, your fear does not trump my life.  Period.
1525133857011519494	quite a few positive covid tests I’ve seen from FWA so far…please test twice if you went!!
1356671090815336449	@chipcoffey I just take some Tylenol with my vaccine and it helped. That’s what we used to with our flu shots as well in the post acute rehab where I worked. After having COvid and 10 days in the hospital, no comparison.
1367124227959238656	Y’all. The irony of getting a positive Covid test back the same day I could have made my appointment for the vaccine. I am SCREAMING.  But only internally because my throat hurts. #blessit
1374699719721635846	@HatchedMatched @MichaelYeadon3 @ScottPe40495762 @Turboshunt Are you incapable of a nuanced debate? It is rife, that doesn't stop me from getting you to admit that it's happened at least once (which I guess you now have). If you go into hospital for a broken leg, catch covid there, die of a blood clot, you clearly didn't die of covid
1478260901501444096	If one person test positive for COVID/ OMICRON .. I’m not living my house ever again.. 2022 bel manmi ou fenk komanse poze non 😩😩🥴🥴
1367139141285257227	@yhsparksfire Thanks I understand what you’re saying. I want society to open up not just for myself but for everyone. I might not be affected by Covid but if there’s a chance I could pass it on unknowingly and someone else down the line is hospitalized or worse, I’ll take the vaccine
1473562701817339905	I got sick, called doc, he wouldn't see me because I'm unvaxed.  After neg rapid test result doctor still wanted a tele-visit because I'm unvaxed. No flu test, no stethoscope, no other test, ONLY COVIDWound up in the hospital with a pneumonia in 2 days.Time for a new Doc

1461053040484659205	@Ticketmaster thanks for considering the health of all your attendees at Jeff Dunham at Wright State Nutter Center. My whole family tested positive for Covid and you refuse to refund us. Guess we will still go and pray for the thousands of people that will be exposed.
1454555899234635776	I thought Covid was supposed to be far more dangerous and kill the unvaccinated.  Not proving to be the case in NZ, how many unvaccinated in ICU have died of covid.  should be lots from all the accounts of the doomsayers.
1373258797607751692	Unfortunately everyone in my home tested positive for Covid say a prayer for us we are all experiencing symptoms.
1509970232945016832	@LivnUndaATyrant We've all had covid in our house, the two youngest tested positive but you couldn't tell they even had it, I was the worst but then it was very mild couple of panadol and back to normal.
1527393666498760706	@kylenabecker @CDCgov This is why I've chosen not to vaccinate my 12-year-old who had COVID in February 2020 and tested positive for antibodies.
1432978183352111104	@andrewflood @Rorymon @mgordon84 @gavreilly They’re not that complicated. If I go into hospital with a broken leg and have Covid I shouldn’t be a Covid admission but I am. If I am in ICU with lung cancer and catch Covid in there I shouldn’t be a Covid ICU number yet I am.
1559592838093885440	I'm supposed to fly to the East Coast Thursday morning for 10 days with the kiddos on the lake. So, of course, I test positive for Covid last night. Yeah, I'm feeling kind of salty (and achy and cough-y).
1394452610996912128	Fully vaccinated in February, diligent mask wearer. Tested positive for covid-19 today. Surprised. Thought I had seasonal allergies. Continue to be self aware. Vax is not a guarantee. TG I can distance outdoors! #vaccinated #PfizerVaccine https://t.co/xw0wHTRDxD
1391274716338561024	@SheilaW04587482 @TheoFleury14 Unfortunately I was in the ICU unit for nine days and then covid Recovery Unit in the hospital for 27 so yes I'm a covid survivor lived experience. So I received my information from the horse's mouth not the horse's ass. God bless the doctors and the nurses.
1478463348681449476	So I tested positive on the covid take home test and my job wants me to come in lol
1460039095493828613	mark my words if my covid test is positive I'm killing myself before it kills me or ruins my health even morenot letting that shit eat me alive. fuck that.
1483187740489523206	professor tested positive for covid the day before classes started and is too sick to do an online lecture i love good news! sorry to him tho hope he gets better ❤️
1386540197320433668	I wonder if it's worse to get COVID, go to the hospital, end up on a ventilator, and have permanent organ damage...orGet the 2nd shot, take a couple Tylenol, and have a nap? https://t.co/EJM58iFdSX
1483541967921467394	My gripe with the mail order covid tests is that they're only giving four per household!?! Like how often can I request them, what if my family has more than four members, does this number take into account how QUICKLY someone can test positive after countless negatives?
1425120980909891587	@therecount Lindsey Graham announced he had tested positive for covid 8 days ago. Today, he's back in the Senate. Vaccinated or not, I would not be standing this close to him. https://t.co/6tUDhxtSL9
1482896938853093376	@Fiona_M_Russell @GarthGodsman I hope no one is surprised by this. We’ve had two years of politicians and CHOs telling us a covid diagnosis is a one way ticket to ICU, a ventilator and death.
1541081234100879360	@bt21cipher SAMEEEE I haven't been active on twitter cause I was so busy with uni and finding internships shdjdj but i tested positive for covid a few days ago so I have nothing to do now AND SEOKJIN ATTACKS ME LIKE THIS
1511682614310191109	14,000 men should’ve been diagnosed with #prostatecancer during covid, but they weren’t. So where are they? Look at the @ProstateUK risk checker and don’t end up being diagnosed too late. My husband was lucky and only had to have surgery aged 51. And that’s a good outcome…
1441517573032407046	@DexterTempest @FibonacciNature @talkRADIO @JuliaHB1 @carlheneghan Genuine question : Did they? Or did they die of a different illness but tested positive for covid within 28days. Honestly the government figures are so twisted I have no idea what's what. And how many young people died today because they were not diagnosed sooner 😔
1536851946514137089	And I have to go to orientation for my new job but i tested for covid within the past 36 hours and im negative and im not sick at all and ill bring my mask with me but if i tested positive i would miss it even tho it would be a pain in the ass but thankfully im not
1461724039827886092	@RWMaloneMD According to the Government of Spain, 40% of those hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit today are vaccinated.In my opinion, these covid vaccines are a failurehttps://t.co/GCkk9HCGJ2
1458007553925947393	Nearly a week since I tested positive for covid and I still just as bad as I did on day 1. Can someone reassure me it gets better soon please? Really struggling with it now.
1424409054550528003	@8645inAZ @EvilTwin2point0 @SamWeb13 @openpdxschools @CRBerginMD I was actually 1 of the two patients in recently. Wasn't even asked to take a covid test. I was paralyzed by my dentist with novicane and rushed in to the ICU. I was told I was the most exciting case they had that week. So not buying any of this what if crap.
1460748745289699332	@LisaMarieBoothe It just hit me = the reason they shut her down as if their lives depended on it is @JedediahBila was going to get back to the false (?) statistics that Joy Behar quoted RE the Covid-flu-shot making people less likely to be hospitalized and less likely to die from Covid...
1380358316489117698	@rationalexpect1 @JoeHansenAZ @mkibbe Sure..when a guy runs into a brick wall going 65 and test positive for covid, it's listed as a covid death instead of a car accident.  I really belive those numbers.
1373642134553833472	Won’t be shooting games for two weeks because of covid (I’ve had zero contact with anyone who tested positive btw) fuck 😤🖕🏻 (I’m negative for covid btw)
1429441470679945216	@ScottBr87569690 @BarbaraMain07 @dremilyportermd I personally know two people fully vaccinated who ended up in the ICU with Covid. Vaccinations aren't 100%! They survived probably because they were vaccinated but without proper care might not have.

I managed those visits while being on my covid duty in hospital. Really wanted to witness parade but!
1606019119668596736	I would test positive for COVID right before Christmas 😅
1376577377975812098	The doctor at my jobs Covid Vaccine Open Hour is answering a question about pregnant women &amp; he’s clarifying that pregnant women are SIGNIFICANTLY more likely to end up in ICU bc of Covid but the vaccine will also cover the fetus &amp; also allow you to pass antibodies in breastmilk
1474161685044813825	For those of ya saying stfu it’s too early to have caught COVID at vibra… I just tested positive and my symptoms started Tuesday. So go get checked 🤦🏻‍♀️
1377706249576280065	@SamiosGregory @Buster_ESPN I wish they could, but if COVID is going through the Nats, there could be some other team members who are infected but their viral load isn’t high enough to register on a test. They could still be contagious, and test positive in another few days.
1451590431091957796	"""Never in my wildest imagination did I think that there would be Coloradans that didn't want to protect themselves, didn't love themselves enough to almost eliminate their risk of being hospitalized,"" Gov. @jaredpolis told reporters.#Covid19 #pandemichttps://t.co/f78gk65ixl"
1446943067970416645	@illCryptmatic @Trumptr65333676 @AmyAThatcher Yes, they were. The vaccine isn’t a 100% guestsntee that you won’t contract COVID, but your chances of becoming extremely sick or hospitalized are very low if you do. I’m fully vax’d and living my life. And if an establishment still requires a mask I will comply.
1456637043509956621	@drfyne @cspan @New_Narrative @RandPaul Thank you for confirming I was correct. We need to get healthy as a nation and stop the misinformation. Do you know that if you contract Covid you have a less than 1% chance of being hospitalized? If you ask Democrats over 50% think that you have a 50% chance of being hospitalize
1468590431558533120	This is the 4th or 5th time I have been in isolation because someone I met subsequently diagnosed with covid.Don't know whether two days of isolation and tweeting wholeday helps ? :)-But it's worrisome for people around
1486903138674098183	@funkybot @elonmusk Many people I know who are vaccinated still got COVID. Didn't end up in hospital at least.
1440206296997761036	@suntuner @chrisrock I had both the AZ and Pfizer vaccines before getting sick with SARS-COVID-19 virus. It felt like a BAD flu... BUT even with being vaccinated I still have long term respiratory damage even though I spent ZERO time in the hospital.Don't play with fire... please get vaccinated.
1465016137733734402	@LSmaagard @mit_your_faults @evamckend You definitely can be hospitalized without an ID, for any reason COVID or not, and many people are. (I work in the healthcare sector.) 1/2

1426933018065653765	@waitwhat2829 @Bizzle00666230 @GovRonDeSantis If you know 5 people that have died in the last two weeks due to covid, that means you surround yourself with extremely unhealthy people. Take better care of your body. I know over 20 people who tested positive, none died and all 100% back to normal.
1374572767882981376	Might have the heart based COVID infection, possibly blood clots in my legs, going to the ER AGAIN. Hopefully this time I’ll have some answers.

1479696766195085315	With everything happening in the hospital right now and the number of HCWs getting sick, I could not believe there are still COVID shamers.

1511800519253274627	I know that hundreds of thousands of people experienced same, but instead their loved one died in the hospital alone with COVID. I empathize. But this is my experience. I’ve not lost one person (even an acquaintance) to COVID.

He had to quarantine and she had to go to the hospital for her lungs. She then soon died. The aides often work for various places. They must all be vaccinated!
1472502467636178946	You are joking millions of people did not get covid. I was shocked to find out recently that 1 person I know had covid in April 2020. He has Epstein-Barr was hospitalized for 1 day, told he would be fine and they kicked him out of the hospital in Toronto. He is in his mid-50's.

1549038891747115008	After a week of living with my husband who tested positive for Covid. I'm...still negative. Both PCR and rapid tests repeatedly every 2 days in the last week shows negative. Should I submit myself for research now?
1519013982161543170	@LifeNewsHQ I had Kamala would test positive for something contagious on my 2022 Bingo Card, but it wasn't for Covid.
1471648586484039685	@raniabolton WHEW!!!! The way I had to go to the ER earlier with chest pains. Didn’t know if it was COVID or a heart attack 🥴
1380205613079261191	Strangely believe that smoking Mj kept me safe from this “corona” Every single test (7th time now) has came out negative, even being close to others that were positive. 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
1449569300281544706	@Shem_Infinite I just looked up..CDC…whether you test positive or not for Covid_19 you should still get vaccinated! They don’t recommend antibody testing for natural immunity. Unbelievable. #suspicious https://t.co/yMrePR5pYA https://t.co/vGcc1uZf8G
1467892099106365442	@steveflatman @RickyHolden41 @Nigel_Farage Seriously, if I had asthma I would be more worried &amp; affraid of catching Covid-19 versus having an asthma related issue, for a few minutes when entering a shop! It's night &amp; day 4 me! U could die with Covid even in a hospital but r much more likely to survive asthma in hospital!
1384426089561399298	@JamesMelville @jones_celia I believe this, too. I haven't seen my beloved Mum-in-Law for 15 months. Nursing home, has had covid outbreak- Hard work 💔 Mum recovered -she is 93, but there seems to be a positive test result in the home every time we make arrangements to see her. She's missing gt grandbabies
1449866068613386242	@RuthieR @TheAlexHughes I had no symptoms. I took my first ever test 2 months ago . Positive ! 2 weeks isolation followed . Don’t wait for symptoms , just test at least once a week or you could be killing people ! There is no limit to Covid symptoms !
1461817179297431554	A lot of people have been sick the last 2-3 weeks but not 1 person I know has actually tested positive for COVID. Please keep in mind it is FLU SEASON. Stop blaming people for making u sick. This shit happens every year around this time. Sick doesn’t automatically mean COVID.
1425101370642903048	@MarcusRashford Great to hear you doing well Marcus. My 11 year old luke just tested positive for Covid &amp; will miss first game in his new seat at old trafford Saturday. Heart broken. You won’t see this in a sea of messages but if you do give him a shout he’s a massive fan &amp; has read ya book ❤️
1474044939285766144	@JoshBradley117 @MAJTOURE Well I was vaxxed and was diagnosed with Covid Saturday. My wife, vaxxed, was diagnosed on Friday. Took monoclonal antibodies, feeling better. Now hopefully we’re good. If this new one is more contagious, less deadly, and beating the vax, it will hopefully not mutate more.
1464320465732833283	@Dabills73 @DominicInsinna @WGRZ I asked if the percentage is of COVID PATIENTS or of ALL PATIENTS in the hospital.
1425179178471723013	@jondiazphoto @LGMSAM21 @ochocinco I’m a mathematician/scientist who works with A.I. I understand probability pretty well, and every study of real world vaccine efficacy shows that they reduce your chances of 1. Catching, 2. Spreading, 3. Being hospitalized with, 4. Dying from COVID-19. That’s an undeniable fact!
1360792261609594881	I KNEW IT ISN'T REALLY A VACCINE!!!! JUST LIKE A FLU SHOT!!!!!Four people in Oregon who received both doses of vaccine test positive for coronavirus https://t.co/3Gh7KiC48h via @nbcnews
1544402154928078849	Apologies for missing #AncestryHour tonight; another long day at work, plus feeling poorly. (Mr H tested positive for Covid yesterday.) I’m not keeping up with everything on Twitter at the moment but feel free to tag me with anything you think I should see.
1474384500071227401	@SajalTanna The hospitalization and ICU net admission rate is astounding. I have no idea where we will find enough staff especially as there non Covid numbers of patients hospitalized are much higher than before and we’re on holiday staffing
1381348910082457600	steve felt rlly naughty and ate an entire family size bag of skittles. my covid test is going to be positive for hyperglycaemia and bleeding gums

1489775813285203969	Day 15ish I think of covid. Tested positive again/still yesterday. Follow up with my family dr tomorrow after speaking w her today .
1478405064670732295	Yesterday over 1 million people in the US tested positive for COVID. My black ass will be in the house until the summer.
1379851049557762049	@sazzygram3 I'm sorry you are still struggling; I suppose I can also say I'm glad your not in the hospital.  How long have you been sick with Covid?  So many people struggle for weeks or months.  I hate steroids...hope they don't hit you as badly as they hit me.
1468812204929605632	@GBfanforevah The go-fund me states that he is “hospitalized due to an illness” in the headline.  But it’s covid
1483125462792642571	Getting Covid tested. Took one at home it was positive. Now got to get an official head me for work
1377433424990855181	@NorthshoreChris @Byronsam91 @ronaldwardjr @LouisianaGov Are hospitalized from covid, I bet THAT will hurt businesses more.
1616770519683981312	@AngusMemes4 @RogerJStoneJr He’s a businessman, needs financing. I can’t forget how much I admired when he ordered 2 medical vessels to hold the Covid infected American tourists. Oh! the world politicians played the same drama, they were hospitalized 3-4 days then discharged in full recovery. Boris twice.
1421561771085557763	@SongBird3411 @Garrett_Archer I trust ASU more than I do QC and Gilbert Schools. Look up higleylinkcrew on Instagram and watch the story. @HigleyHS Supposedly a letter went about about a positive Covid test, then they host a school dance. #higleyhighschool
1439149552137875456	@PerezHilton My #COVID19 artThis is so wrong #PerezHilton the vaccine has broken the link between being in hospital the vile #antivaxxers is putting this already ill mans life in danger by taking him from hospital when he clearly needs vaccine so sad he may die when he could live bad choice https://t.co/zD6lHFf1Pf
1387855276687101958	Bruh I tested positive for covid 30 minutes before I was scheduled for my second vaccine
1421186107148955648	@DomenicoScotto6 @HrmsaBchBrent @manpreetkailon The data is easy to find. In May - 1.1% of the total covid cases that ended up in the hospital were vaccinated.  And .8% of the total covid deaths were in vaccinated individuals. I can link you so you can call my source bogus - or you can google it yourself.
1538104098150563840	@GeelongCats73 @KGHohenstauffen @Nigel_Farage Dont know anyone who as ended up in hospital with covid apart from my triple jabbed mate. He didn't survive so that's your theory fucked mate.
1602049366205800451	@Saramac7 I repeat GPs, not doctors working in hospitals, hid behind Covid and made it near impossible to get appointments. One, actually diagnosed an ankle injury over a phone call. Not video. Now, that is BOLLICKS.
1559544511927164928	@CortesSteve Agree…Same here (In Denver area). I don’t know one person who has tested positive for COVID that is unvaccinated. Many that are vaccinated have tested positive some with pretty significant symptoms.
1541676842461134848	@parkeg1 @kallmemeg 🤦🏾‍♂️ No, I’m not mistaken. I’m saying that the way we have recorded COVID deaths is those who died for any reason with 28 days of a positive test. Therefore, I would like to know the number of people who died for any reason with 28 days of a COVID vaccine.
1478899626015088640	I've had a cold, body aches, a fever, and a sore throat before. I bet if I would've taken a covid test back then it would come back positive. Those are also common cold and flu symptoms too 😐 unless you can't breathe, don't take a covid test because the body heals itself
1388494708293390337	At what point is it ok to have a lack of empathy for people who refuse to get vaccinated, catch Covid and end up in the hospital? Cause in my small circle of the world over the past few months I’ve known 3 people in this situation 😠 #GetVaccinated #Stoptaxingourhealthcareworkers
1511440513672622085	I tested positive yesterday for covid.I am both sick and emotionally taxed right now.I’ll not promise any streams this week but I do want to stream when I can and feel comfy to.Love ya guys https://t.co/CEVkFuGe6Q
1483102716696186889	I'm raising money for Help, out of work due to covid positive test. Click to Donate:  https://t.co/DOOHoM3bMw #GoFundMe
1417566516422324225	I'm back into the ward tomorrow after 10 days and doing training offsite last week. In that time nearly half the patients have tested positive for covid.If you need me I'll be in a corner giving myself an ulcer from anxiety. https://t.co/GW3FB2hJzB
1585970129631936512	@Kazzy2412 Like I said, there could have been a bio weapon released. But the majority never died of covid and tested positive on a fake test. I know people who said they had covid when they had a runny nose.
1391557070391058436	@eikcamko @barbout @CTVKitchener Sarcasm. If Covid doesn’t exist (like many at the rally would like to believe) then the people in the ICU’s must have something else. I would think seeing first hand would change a few minds (I hope, but probably wouldn’t)
1543696339879579649	@madlings01 @mividaloca100 Oh yes I bet it did! It was difficult for people without diagnosed issues but for a dementia sufferer and family it must have been so hard, how do you explain COVID to someone with severe memory issues?
1388370377278115841	@jnicolemorgan I had covid last July (positive test to prove it) and the first shot did not phase me. We will see about #2. 😬 But I think it’s purely anecdotal and doesn’t tell you anything to see your reaction or lack thereof to the vaccine.
1486861926080520199	@ksorbs So to get what would clear me up faster and cheaper I have to go to the emergency room. Which puts me at risk of catching covid but for her safety she can't see me.
1521230267121164288	@Long_Live_Cel if you ever need a positive or negative covid test within time frame 15-45min msg me! I can do it for ya 😁
1482609532446851075	@MunchPhd @hillsnumerology Thanks for the link but that's not data that's an article. I'm more interested in deaths per day from vaxxed/unvaxxed. Now let's put things into perspective, at the moment we only have around 185 in ICU. Cancer kills 125 a day in Australia yet here we are hysterical about covid.
1543382679219052544	@Generally_Kris i had a brief scare regarding covid; a family member i went to stay with for the weekend last ended up testing positive for it the day after i left. I tested negative the next day, but still sort of anxiously awaiting a dry cough to surface to see if it’s just catching on.
1382296585372045313	@kb_rebellion No I tested positive for covid after having my first shot.
1375940932009394184	I spent 12 hours in the ER (where I heard at least 5 other patients tested positive for covid) and 4 days in a psych ward where patients weren't given masks and staff wore theirs incorrectlySuddenly I have a fever and I'm wheezy :)))))
1368933576344010758	My doctors were unaware of this so if you know anyone who is diagnosed with severe mental health illness or are a carer then you are now eligible for the covid-19 vaccine. @MindCharity https://t.co/JuM20cNJPm
1532414709512687618	i dont think ill actually need to go to the er for my covid symptoms but maybe i should order a pulse oximeter to monitor oxygen lvls at home ;-;
1448632933649162246	@newhandlehun That's not true 100% of the time. I do care about ending up in an ICU bed and would take the vaccine to avoid that. But I already had Covid before vaccines were offered so I know a bed in hospital/ICU isn't needed in my case. I'm not the only one like this.
1374115804569030665	"oh jersey pushed bak openings again?!! im convinced half the ppl who tested ""positive"" for COVID nvr fkn had it. they want the numbers to go up so they can push opening everything bak so they can control us. COVID is a scare tactic and guess what.. it workin 🤦🏼‍♀️"
1437380276846481409	I don't think production faked a positive covid test. She was probably just exposed, so they couldn't bring her into the house. The best way to avoid that would've been to stay at home until sequester started! #BB23
1478594499949608960	@Brasilmagic @h3h3productions Never said healthy people are not ending up in the hospital. It’s a virus it spreads even if you are vaccinated or not. It’s not one size fits all. I know people that have been jab 3 times and have died or in the hospital because of covid…
1386926791546130434	I need to try and use my covid positive test from last year as much as possible before teachers and admin stop giving a fuck
1483307058715717633	@SSSmith3421 @MdBreathe @PonderPeeples I’m more proud of the fact he’s both ICU and ER certified, and that he’s been nursing Covid in ICU’S from the beginning than his bachelor in SCIENCE
1480577821642735619	@Trisha_F_2579 @JohnJGaltrules @CarlZha @SecFudge Im an ER nurse, and am in the heart of it.  The pandemic is not destroying our health care system. We see both vax and unvaxxed covid patients in ER, and a lot of others who are there for things unrelated to covid, but if they come and test, positive, I’m required to list covid.
1479573911423574022	@DKThomp Because correct me if I’m wrong, but most of the risk metrics were calculated based on the assumption that hospitalization statistics assumed being hospitalized FROM Covid?
1380568274782552065	Last week this girl told me she couldn’t get covid because she was prophesied to......she just tested positive 🤦🏾‍♂️
1332272367557619712	I really did not want to share this, but with many people concerned over Christmas celebrations, my mum fell at home and acquired covid in hospital, a doctor phoned me this morning and told me she will not make it, she nearly did as the vaccine is so close, keep safe everyone.
1452795320715268103	My sibling has tested positive for Covid. Prayers please, they were already disabled and in poor health.
1507097284080717840	@claregrogan2 @ReadingSub89 @AlteredImages5 @TheMetatronsvox I’m gutted waited nearly two years for this and tested positive for Covid this morning.
1386292198501715968	@bacon6966 @jayguay @DavidSteadson The news has been like this the entire pandemic. I work in the local county govt. I know not one single person whose been hospitalized or died from covid. I know a ton of people who have been infected. No major problems.
1408811131448201217	My point is, play ball. It’s time to return to normal. I realize four fully vaccinated players tested positive but there’s been no word on if they have symptoms. The vaccine’s selling point has never been “No COVID,” it’s always been “no serious symptoms.” Play ball.
1390302647610130432	@DiGiovanniPT @mattyglesias My wife got hit hard by COVID and was hospitalized for a week. She also had bad side effects to both moderna injections, fever, headaches. She’s seems to be very susceptible to this virus so we are very concerned about the 617 variant and vaxs effectiveness against it
1473319652235354112	@KellyScaletta We’re 1-2 weeks out on knowing his many will be hospitalized, and 3-4 weeks out on death toll. Covid hasn’t changed. We’re in for a bumpy ride, I’m afraid.
1438388008420585473	@Rsalasor @deuce5seven @AStanlsBored @milkmaraj I mean the data from highly vaccinated areas like Israel and Massachusetts alone kinda are not backing up your claim. The vaxed have no problem ending up in the hospital and do still spread COVID. Sorry but no sense in me taking an experimental vax for a virus I've had.
1486937041640251394	I tested positive for Covid and will not be attending the $ILUS shareholders meeting.  @Nick will be on hand to answer any questions on $DRCR and the Swifty ecosystem. Team at Swifty are also available for any questions @SwiftyGlobal
1420374235814535169	@flgirl2156 @teprutledge @Bethorama33 They will tell you if you have Covid. My wife and I had it and the test was positive. I'm not a huge fan of all this testing. I also think Covid was blown way out of proportion for political reasons. I have asthma &amp; diabetic and I had no issues while having covid. Except.....
1463947811955773443	@NSWHealth Ha ha I believe Israel is the leading the world already up to the 3rd and 4th booster!!! But have the highest spike in covid!! 98% in hospital are triple vaxxed. 🤔
1431647418655838209	@donwinslow Could have been prevented. I am fighting negative 3 breast cancer. It is in my lymph nodes. Both vaccinated. Husband got Covid from going through er to visit me. He kissed me on the lips 3 times the night before he was diagnosed! Isolated 2 weeks. I didn’t get it. Vax saved us!
1422081704727035908	Can we bring the mask mandate back please? Someone I know just tested positive for COVID— and she received the full series of the vaccine.
1479041546641149958	I can't be the only one who feels a little disappointed when getting a negative covid test can I? It's not like I want covid, but at least if it came back positive I wouldn't feel like I gagged on a swab for nothing.
1435229938102280192	Manager tested positive for covid and been walking around without a mask. Watch me make a scene.
1376919259746557956	Took a second Covid test today to validate the first positive result and it turns out I don’t have Covid. Next up - getting my procedure rescheduled https://t.co/b6SiqhyPcB
1531058606413578240	Same here for husband &amp; me. Vaxxed &amp; boosted. Got covid; 5 days on paxlovid. Improvement, then continued symptoms. 19 days from  positive test on 5/6 to negative test on 5/25. Fatigue is disheartening (tho obviously not dire). But worrisome.
1398643885618966533	@wesley2405 Hilarious that you say that when I've been working in full classrooms with students who have tested positive for COVID and yet I've never gotten sick myself.
1371729532974100482	@RealHousewifeMi I tested positive for Covid on 2/28 symptoms started 2/25. Symptoms consisted of achy joints, fever, chills and intense fatigue. I was released from quarantine 3/8z The worse of it lasted for a week. I was so close to getting a vaccine then this happened...
1530956741915312128	Just wanted to let everyone know that Micah tested positive for covid yesterday. I know what it's like to be sick but there is no worse feeling than watching your child be sick.💖 💗 💘 ❤️
1471363261534777348	@GMB Yep that's it gmb show video of people in hospital with covid what haven't had there jab but I thought 90% of the country as had there jabs shouldn't we have heard immunity by now
1378202980676079618	@DianaDee16 @Nybaciox @sunnysweetsFM @DevilishChild29 @girlboss_nation @nytimes I have chronic diseases. My husband and I had covid and almost had to be hospitalized for difficulty breathing. We have leftover issues and we're bedridden for over a month. I took my chance at the vaccine IMMEDIATELY. Got my final dose yesterday and hubby got first dose, today👍
1397224451511656450	I’ve had two people in my family “die from covid.” One died of a stroke while having covid &amp; one was going through kemo for cancer &amp; just died in the hospital. Both were old folks. Both classified as a covid death even though at least one was irrefutably not a “covid” death.
1483690908948512770	I tested covid Positive through mylab self test. Is mylab self test for covid is reliable?
1452381560817258504	"Here's another story from @hhsgov..""I survived covid..spent 76 days in the hospital..get vaxxed."" Y'all just keep pushing the fear propaganda (evident by the ""scared to live"" people in the comments)."
1512742994507866114	dreamt I tested positive for covid last night, thank goodness I still tested negative first thing in the morning zzzz
1537132207461912577	@ekuber My wife had COVID, tested positive for 10 days. I didn't take any precaution and didn't catch it.Then I flew a couple months later and caught it in flight. :-|
1432295466025328641	I had to pick which patient to send to the ICU for better care. I sent the younger one by 2 years with a slightly better chance of surviving. Both had COVID.
1384988528837267456	i tested positive for covid y’all 😭😭😭😭😭 omg that’s crazy
1379390290692354051	@YorkshireTeach @fbtoast @MaxMigliorato My mam is 67 with underlying health conditions and she says enough is enough, she has had her first jab.I'm 50 and only 366 people without underlying health conditions died with a positive covid test last year, so  your husband must be at even less risk than me at his age.
1511868309800886276	My bestie has just tested positive for Covid &amp; she sounds like shit! Good job, I haven’t seen her since Sunday. (I mean that in the nicest possible way 👎🏻
1586405468393869313	@1AwkwardFish @Thenexus1972 @FloraConley12 @MsHummingWay @PoliticsVerse It's incorrect that you can't spread covid if you've been vaccinated, but I don't think it was a lie, but rather simplistic, wishful thinking. It's accurate to say you're less likely to get covid, and be hospitalized and die, and less likely to spread it, if you're vaccinated.
1465147538734927874	@thatchicknana01 September 2021. When I got tested positive with covid
1538896386816630784	Me thinking I was immune from Covid then I attended my graduation in UCD on Friday and sure enough, 3/5 of us have all tested positive on an antigen within 2 mins 😐 #COVID19 #COVID19ireland
1471281074177290241	@EricThompsonTCM @Johnathan_Wood1 If it’s just a positive test with no symptoms yes….2 negative, but if he actually has Covid then we see Simmons.  I’m sure our genius HC will have JF and lazor ready for quick passes and running the ball more than 10 times 🙄
1442224264598286346	@ThePerezHilton My husband got a false positive once. Got a covid test before traveling..negative. got a covid test at the border it was positive. Got a 2nd opinion at a clinic the day after his results, it was negative. I always suggest second opinions if you have no symptoms
1578146407839506434	@kar_nels @EricTopol I went to the hospital with Covid pre-vaccines so there’s always a chance your booster did reduce the severity of your infection. I think I got Covid twice this year, both times I was sick maybe 36-48 hours, and nothing serious.
1429135711593107459	Woke up this morning to a text that someone close to me is in the ICU w/ covid
1546582480471240704	@HaSeongsRim Should I go? I just got diagnosed with Covid… but it’s L.A, everyone has it right?
1562297927028117504	This is not a vaccine. It's an mNRA. It provides no protection from catching covid. Or transmitting covid. Hospitalized with covid. Dying with covid. Changing the definition of vaccine don't make this a vaccine. Ain't passing on my back and telling me it's raining.
1488997497854963730	I was just hospitalized with Covid, I didn't receive any vivid medications, just steroids.
1572729659787452416	The bad news is I tested positive for covid. The good news is I technically have a little more time to edit videos.
1391352908231315461	After experiencing mild symptoms, I’ve just tested positive for COVID.
1341354416314736641	My wife who is a nurse practitioner in an outpatient adult practice was diagnosed with #COVID19 last week. Since then, we have adopted very strict isolation practices. She was awaiting her vaccine as this happened. She followed all the rules and was extra careful, but even that https://t.co/rkl4wgxXbc
1354781344623165440	@Emmett_Hanger I’ll bet since Richmond Mayor Stoney (a Democrat) has tested positive for Covid, Governor Northam will hustle to get more vaccine to Virginia. Let’s hope. I’m still on the waitlist.
1387616364760903682	"Logic is not strong with people who are proud 2 say ""I never wore a mask outdoors"" &amp; ""The vaccine is too experimental!"" A lovely family member caught covid, gave it to his wife, who then had 2 go to the ER 2x &amp; whose life was saved by an experimental drug by Eli Lilly. Hugs! https://t.co/cTsEfoD0Ss"
1376353307132719107	@Manchu__ @Thatone_blonde_ @jeffcrouth @MonicaGandhi9 I am not hesitant! If I do get sick with covid my risk of being hospitalized (or dying) has gone way down. That was the point. Most teachers should be vaxxed and not have to worry about being hospitalized. No reason for school not to be open.
1420456582282846211	@Ken_bbFan @SLOTribune Actually I've heard of many more people getting a cold or other respiratory illness since so few are wearing masks. No, they're not chalking it up to Covid. Only those with a Covid positive test are counted.
1405208987037995008	💭 When and who were the last notable players that tested positive? I can’t recall anyone missing time due to covid this year.
1483787366833786881	Calling all #prayerwarriorsPlease pray with my for Tim. He's in the hospital for complications from Covid. 💜🙏Cc: @Evie_B2 share please, love 🙏
1484568439272398852	I’ve successfully avoided Covid for almost 2 years, then I test positive when I’m 19 weeks pregnant. 🆘
1465800623190855685	Folks I tested positive to Covid on Monday morning. I am in isolation for next ten days  this is my second time I suffer same fate. Luckily not as bad as last time. Could be the fact that I am vaccinated.  Good night.
1452338828463640576	@TheCoronaCure_ Not until after the vaccine was deployed. Otherwise it was vague medical terminology that I had heard a few times. Now I know what it is and here about young people being diagnosed with it weekly.
1567768172215812097	@philipjonathn I would gladly take them. I weighed 180 when I got Covid Sept 2, 2020. Lost down to 146 while I was sick and in the hospital. Now I can't get past 165 no matter what I do.😕
1344442323837607942	At least I will start the New Year great as having my Covid vaccine Monday 😊We were all tested in work last weekend as a couple were positive but most of us tested negative which was nice to know.
1428040120930906126	@ComradeEevee My inlaws are both in the hospital for the second time in a month (with persistent covid pneumonia) and they will assure you that covid is a hoax and the vaccine is poison.
1377490119947526145	dude 11 other colleagues are on quarantine rn bc 1 of us was tested positive of covid n there was some close contacts meanwhile im still waiting for my results lowkey anxious tbh
1510281797031981058	@sunlorrie It doesn't make a difference vaxxed or unvaxxed. People experience covid differently for some reason. I have not had a single covid vaxx. When I had covid (my 5 family members the same) it was a mild cold for approx 5 days. The vast majority of people in hospital are vaxxed.
1436338824947412995	@POTUS I'm in more danger of ending up in the hospital,or worse yet killed,from people driving like assholes on the highway! I drive trucks for a living and I've had COVID not worried about getting it again. Very unlikely.
1520248307670405121	If I test positive for Covid ima get paid by my job to stay home and make beats for ten days😤
1388491608484552712	I am worried about this, our Chief Minister does not come out of the farm house (Is me koi shak nai) Now he will update us news related to health department every day. No patients have been met in the hospital yet since #COVID19 started in our state, He tooks charge.
1466810035892363266	Day 166Guess who's walking to get a COVID test because someone I hung out with yesterday got a positive result this morning?(They didn't know at the time and was vaxxed. Also, my result was negative.) https://t.co/L9IQ2mz8LS
1489639432626085896	@Mo0gster @MdRational …here before. The Covid hospitalizations have at best been a handful in most of the hospitals around me, and cases in icu even less. It doesn’t justify all the wailing about overwhelmed hospitals. What they should be concerned about is people missing out on important screening..
1399405470415265799	@NBWannaBs We’ve both had Covid; I caught it in hospital after my heart scare and both fully vaccinated now but I (Margaret) am still really nervous around people. Everyone just seemed so blasé about everything as if the last 18 months hadn’t happened
1470106056470806533	#SouthAfrica's health authority confirms the #Covid19 numbers, and the positive test rate is over 60%So as I warned yesterday, not to read much into the low positive test rate, so today don't be too alarmed by this number.
1548963632913981441	@Crip2DaX @polleyovski Hey man, I tested positive for Covid and the arts I see make me happy.  You can check my work.https://t.co/y9RAHMzhCz https://t.co/r11hURx4qF
1374102844488437768	@EasyPease69 You sad sad “man” -stay w/UR Seditious tribe where U belong. I bet u know ppl in the hospital literally DYING from Covid, who swear 2 the Nurses, who lovingly care 4 them, yes -it is a Covid but they think it is a hoax &amp; til their dying breath-they believe it is a conspiracy
1484923421452611594	My husband tested positive at work Fri. I ordered Covid rapid tests from Walmart curbside pickup today.  Walmart responded I would have to come into the store to pick them up (??), then sent an update they were not available.  Tests should have been priority #1 Mar 2020.
1425158242041274373	@ginavergel7 He should stay on top and get tested one more time, especially 7-10 days after. If it was me, I would literally snitch the name of the unvaxxed regional manager. The nerve of that person to go to work while testing positive for covid.
1470115869556723713	I just did a home test &amp;I'm positive for covid.
1556473951701835776	@rep_williams9 And Covid has decimated that trust…The schools were unsafe last year and I have no idea how they will have enough teachers this fall. Covid czar says 100 million new infections hitting this fall.After just being in the hospital, staffing shortages were insane &amp; beds full.
1435982551491874816	I’m fed up with anti-vaxxers and politicians too afraid to get tough with them - The Star #antivaxxers , &amp;#covidiots coddling them,not only recklessly spike hospital admissions into ICU,but also  Spike variants mutations that may evade #vaccine protection! https://t.co/TDJP6dZYZN
1473774936682545161	the other receptionist at my job tested positive for covid and i did nasal swab on my own and it came out negative but my paranoid ass thinking i didn’t stick it up my nose fat enough 😵‍💫😵‍💫
1576061871307661312	@snapthennap @katiegibbs Looks almost identical to the positive test I got when I first had covid in January. Was a clear, solid positive by the next morning’s test… and for the following 13 days.
1442212687031808006	My girlfriend tested  positive covid 🙁Waiting on my results 10 days quarantine now
1604866304153985025	My boss texted me that someone I worked closely with has COVID and to get tested Who has a positive test picture so I can get out of work this week? 😭😭😭
1442919578930089987	@catturd2 @jemmm85517813 I just  believe what I can see now I know at least 30 people with Covid all vaccinated 3 in intensive care 1 in hospital but ok 26 just poorly with flu like symptoms , I don’t really know anyone my age that’s not vaccinated who might get poorly .Only young children and teenagers
1480737076085772291	@KattyB70 @pearlmanswag @thehill It doesn't even matter. My wife was hospitalized for an issue completely unrelated to Covid. They tested everyone admitted every day. If she had tested positive it would have made no difference with regard to what she was being treated for but they would label her an unvax case
1611350694069473282	@AlexBerenson I’ve gotten the flu shot every year since 1992, until last year. I’ve also been hospitalized twice with Influenza. I think I’ve done enough. That is what Covid has done. I doubt I’ll ever take one again.
1382287821986234379	At this point I know more people who have been sick from the vaccine, than those who were sick from covid, one of which who is in the hospital for the vaccine.
1343224595927756801	@dicey631 @jbarro @ChuckRossDC I do worry about myself &amp; family. That’s why you should be the last for a vaccine or denied a ventilator if hospitalized with Covid. Also check out Johns Hopkins website. Facts matter.
1479237218225070082	@HarrietClugston Tell me the actual data before just putting scaremongering statements out there. Also, are they in hospital because of Covid, or with something else and happened to have also tested positive? Once you confirm this I’ll listen 😡
1479231568996618240	// i just tested positive for covid. i’m gonna fucking scream.
1597632124281946112	I am vaccinated. Fully boosted. I have all of the Covid19 co-morbidities.  I tested positive for Covid. My symptoms are extremely mild, other than irregular waves of fatiguesSome will claim vaccines don't work because I got Covid. I think they work well, because I'm not dying
1614829086999822341	@Val_of_decision @jammingem @truthwarrior324 @NatleePaul My husband had leukemia as a child in the early ‘70s. Almost died several times. Got Hep C then from transfusions. Cured two years ago, but diagnosed with stage 3 sorosis. His ID doc threatened to not treat him saying he was a dead man if got Covid.
1440925288167247872	@greysriver @sarahbeth345 I think you’ll find that in the West (Europe, UK, USA etc) we are OVER REPORTING. Especially if a covid death is one where the deceased has tested positive via a dodgy test within the last 28 days!!
1463460141198569473	Pls lilies don't let akgae getting attention from us. This is serious situations. Whoever bring covid 19 as fanwar y'all really need go to hospital check ur mental. I hope lisa gets well soon, and the other members are fine.
1548103401010999296	@VinomanD Testing negative and still feeling terrible = long Covid ?  Tbh I haven’t even tested again yet because  I assumed I’d still test positive
1376765008600821762	@EnragedHancock @yeahrightgirlhg What does me taking the vaccine protect you from? The vaccine is “supposed” to “protect” you from getting bad symptoms and getting hospitalized. Lol you actually believe they took it, that’s all for show. I’m not even anti vaccine, I’m only suspicious of the covid vaccine.
1387610908243816500	@MarcDClair M/F: Did you finish your herpes medication?Obese M/F: Are you pregnant?LGBTQ: How's the AIDS treatment going?Deflect: Did you get plastic surgery?I'm good, why?  Did you test positive for Covid?
1537545814045753345	@BallouxFrancois When the child vaccines were approved last fall, I thought “this is like a really good flu shot” would have been a better message than “get this vaccine or your kid will definitely be hospitalized with covid”
1377026941077876736	@RolloMcFloogle @AlexBerenson My FIL had a stroke the same day as the 2nd dose. At the hospital he tested positive for covid. He's doing okay right now.
1376868085962047493	Advice for #LongCovid patients (PT4). I went from struggling to walk for ten minutes to walking up to 30/45 minutes because of Karen from @AirPhysioLondon 🙌🏽 Dr Man recommended that I book in with them. I was diagnosed with a dysfunctional breathing pattern- breathed too deeply.
1602332238506516481	he just told me he tested positive for covid… is this loona karma orrrr?? i’m sorry i’m never using their name in vain again 😭😭😭
1376304851425107970	@staysafe0325 @drmwarner @Billius27 I have had a pain in my side for a year and am terrified to go to the ER to have it investigated. My doc has not seen patients since last March.  I just want a vaccination so I can safely go to the ER.  I have COPD and Covid will surely kill me.  I am 63.
1470523763384979461	@mpark111 @bradwouters @DFisman Hi Matt- higher transmissibility equals larger denominator infected equals more ppl in hospital relatively speaking. In for hip, +ve for covid? 2 years into this and if you still think that’s significant, I’d say you aren’t paying attention.
1424226734010994690	@MattWalshBlog @JennaEllisEsq I give up.  Over 620 thousand Americans have died from Covid with 1000s currently hospitalized, significant percentage of people refusing to get vaccinated and a stronger strain of the virus.  Nothing to see here.
1510847946392506369	@hicksyalex I had covid pre vax, thought I was going to be in trouble, couldn't breath.I had it post 2 vax, no where near as bad.People who are vaccinated are far less likely to end up in hospital that the unvaxed.That is a recognised fact shown by statistics.Antivaxers deny reality.
1470902460495638537	tested positive for covid and also started my period today https://t.co/CeHcXciyl2
1389718414034305024	@janewells I have compromised immune system due to bone marrow transplant (leukemia). I had absolutely NO side effects to both shots. Subsequently, i got COVID last November, all I had was mild headache and raspy throat. If it weren't for the positive test, i wouldn't have know I had it.
1375928705307062272	One of the grosser stories I’ve read lately. @BarbaraCorcoran and @AROD are really taking care of their tenants — or booting them out while hospitalized, disposing of their belongings, and preparing for new ones. #COVID19
1475969001595494401	@GBNEWS Surely they all were admitted for something else and caught Covid in hospital.  I’m not believing it.
1542170067919441924	@fecak @FormerAntivax @Saikmedi @sarahbeth345 @sdharv19 But you were implying that I claimed kids hospitalized for Covid don’t exist. That wasn’t what I was saying at all. I was talking about typical/average response.
1387395383341424641	@dnurenberg18 That was me last week! Jeff tested positive and I was having covid symptoms to the point where I took the whole week off because I couldn’t stay awake, but my test came back negative 🤷🏼‍♀️
1550588106352447488	Guess who just tested positive for covid… I’m really scared…
1459461065603911682	90% of those in hospital caused by covid are unvaccinated Don't believe the propaganda I know things are tough for many at the moment We will get through it
1476675151207018496	I'm definitely having covid symptoms but no positive test yet. I'm still isolating at home because I don't want to risk getting others sick. Drop movie/TV show recs? Or switch games?
1478959524404858880	I have been tested covid positive... @AKTU_Lucknow @AktuStudents
1475816153775759364	@SeamusORegan In July i tested positive for Covid, got pneumonia, was able to handle it at home with meds provided by my doctor (including ivermectin), and managed to not go to the hospital because I’m not hysterical. Enjoy your actual immunity bestowed by your functional immune system.
1290530218449543168	@sandibachom I wonder if he has received a vaccine for #Covid_19. Seems strange that so many around him have tested positive and he hasn’t. Maybe it’s part of one of the final trial before it gets approved. Hmm...

1529525239507746816	@EricTopol FDA not pushing out variant-specific boosters (i.e. omicron) is a disaster.  Clear dose-response curve for long Covid based on the severity of sequellae.  Further, reduce the severity of the non hospitalized cases should reduce long covid risk substantially.

1475231793309790213	@COYSRach @DanielFooksArt Not true. People go in for other reasons and then get tested with the useless PCR test. Just because the test comes out positive doesn’t mean that they have covid. Also, a rise in admissions since people have been jabbed. It’s not a vaccine. I’m
1437882667618422794	@kbowpt @mmpadellan No vaccine is 100% effective. Just under 1% of Covid deaths now are vaccinated people at high risk. My husband is high risk. Mega stress. With our 3rd booster shots, life has gotten safer. There's another problem caused by the unvaxxed. Hubs had to go to the ER a few wks ago.
1479755711278198786	Questions I have found hard to get answers to:1. How long after contracting Covid will you still test positive on Antigen &amp; PCR tests? i.e. Positive but no longer Infectious Hence what's the point in doing antigen tests when you've recovered?
1612188264638844928	I took last week off from the strip club, I hung out with  2 people unmasked, I took three covid tests throughout the week, and this morning I tested positive for covid again. Please send money and subscribe to my site I am bummed and stressed. Stay safe out there homies
1311901285927448578	For someone who’s been lying and hiding behind many truths, why is it so easy to admit you tested positive for COVID? I’m not sure I believe Trump. Sounds like a ploy to later say he took the vaccine and encourage millions to do the same. Who knows...
1416862205606174721	@yunamusic I have one that I use several times a day. I was having a breathing spasm and it dropped to 85. When the ambulance arrived I was intubated in the driveway. No Covid, Praise God. Fluid around my lungs. In ICU for 2 days last month. I'm praising God to be home.
1451899723925819394	@USMCVETERAN3 @S10Blade Remdesivir is poison. I'm sorry you went through that, but I'm glad HCQ helped, and you pulled through.

1576236818785107968	@DrEliDavid I have never understood the urge people get to post photos of their covid tests onto social media. I know someone who kept all his daily positive tests and those of his kids to take a final photo of about 50 disgusting nose swab tests. Where did he keep them in the meantime?
1382345296689106946	@toryboypierce I think we all knew this anyway.  I think it’s probably more if the truth was told.  Whoever decided on counting all deaths regardless of how they’ve died within 28 days of a positive test as Covid was just following the SAGE narrative on scaring people to death for lockdown.
1373644376971358211	@ScottGottliebMD Nobody on Team Pandemia has been able to explain to me why positive test rate is a key stat. Hospitalizations &amp; deaths, properly caused by COVID (of, not with) r the only indicative stats. In any event, this disease does not justify nonsensical lockdowns. But u do ur narrative.
1359581677274746882	The Bell Co Health Dept called me to tell me I’d tested positive for being a good guy!  They even gave me a shot to give me a 95% chance I would remain that way!  #COVID19 #vaccine #THM #weareallinthistogether https://t.co/14k9yrqf6T

1423310487782100993	Yesterday I went to the hospital to follow up on a passenger of a car that was in a minor accident.ER Nurse: she’s positive for cocaine, heroin, amphetamines, THC, alcohol and ecstasy…and covid.You just test people who aren’t even sick? Weird. &amp; I wish I was at that party.
1386720415058386945	Here’s a question if I was highly exposed to Covid and was tested several times these past few months which never came back positive why do I need the vaccine?!
1376580745892917250	I’m apparently at the level of parenting where I think I can survive 3 dental cleanings, 2 filling appointments, one tooth removal, a Covid test, two Covid vaccines, an EEG, and an MRI — spread across seven people — in one week, on top of normal life. Please send positive vibes.

1298756414157000704	@EATTHER01271082 @DispatchAlerts I know your hope is people will comply to ignorance but we know the actual dangers and covid is far less of a threat than a vaccine that's not properly tried.We have had many staff test positive. Test results lag we are made to work until results come in
1487885648174452740	@char_lawyer I believe he’s in isolation after a positive Covid test. But honestly, can’t he at least do a virtual message addressing all of this?
1476240016812695564	@SkyeZedA I seriously think that returning a positive Covid test is no longer news. The fact is 99% of ppl recover from. Very tiny number die. Sooner or later, everyone in the world will catch COVID. The virus will become part of us just like flu &amp; HIV. No big deal.
1431415831922106368	@MaryLTrump EXACTLY! I recently told a MAGAt family member to not go to the hospital if she gets covid (unvaccinated of course 🙄) It didn't go well cuz no MAGAt likes facts. Bottom line is don't take up the beds if you're too stupid to get a safe vaccine.
1385418605647601669	@SolNataMD @MrTAchilles Factor v is rampant in my family. 3 with F5 who went through covid had 7 months of shortness of breath and two had blood clots to deal with despite being on thinners. None were bad enough w/covid to need to be hospitalized. Is there an F5 link?
1477123301205889025	went on a date with this guy, he was very cautious abt being covid conscious, made sure we both got tested recently etc, mf called me the next day while i was at WORK and said he tested positive, but i didnt catch it 🙏
1611918615472926726	@CKellyUAP Obviously I’m only 1 example but the 1st time I caught Covid i was sick for about 4 days. The 2nd time I caught Covid I tested positive and went straight out the backyard and started mowing. Naturally Immunity works very well against Covid.
1464252241729232898	I really tested positive for Covid two days before my scheduled booster shot 🙄
1459185724713013270	@JudithWood5 I am covid recovered. I was totally asymptomatic but tested positive for antibodies. My immune system prevented my death just fine. I don’t need your experiments.
1432347133881901058	Welp, my pt (52, unvaxxed) with covid had a heart attack &amp; died this weekend d/t complications from covid-19 … the weirdest thing she said to me over a week ago was “being in the ICU is a death sentence. I just have the worst feeling I’m not going to make it out of here” 😓
1480212737082941450	@andremuller01 @zinakw @lazongs Nhs occupational health diagnosed me and the nhs covid exemption pass requires your gp to ok it but he wants me to have jabs at allergy clinic incase of anaphylaxsis yet cannot say if long term damage like my protein disorder.
1440978376576090112	@toadmeister @RWMaloneMD Olympic gold medalist Madison Wilson, age 27, was in the prime of her life. Then she was fully vaccinated, still caught COVID-19, and is hospitalized.I thought the vaccine works?
1387026971557875714	@PissOffTrumpz I won't get mad if they get covid and end up in the hospital.
1456900798823243778	@natsrambles @SandraWeeden But you were in hospital for quite a long time if I remember rightly having seen your posts on here - most people who get covid are not hospitalised. Any long illness where you're unable to move results in muscle wastage, muscle fatigue, general fatigue etc..
1614103013076910080	"@1966Zodiac @JoJoFromJerz I work in the medical field. Hospitals got an ""extra"" 40k for covid deaths. Covid positive test was not required. Everyone died of covid."
1338608503703953409	@Mark62982364 Glad to hear it, Mark! And thank you for your service as a fireman. COVID put me in the ICU earlier this year and I don't have any underlying conditions. Hope you get the vaccine and back to duty swiftly. Stay safe in the meantime.
1426244295896584193	@Gatwick_Airport hi positive COVID test here. Need to cancel booking but due to fly tomorrow morning so can’t amend booking online. How do I do this?
1475517442013241352	@iPoof Genuinely wouldn’t worry to much about people panicking and going to hospital with a bad cold, that majority will be fine with. I’d be more concerning with flu and pneumonia, which like last year will kill far more than covid 👌🏼👌🏼 but can’t scare public with flu can you 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
1522231999062233090	Getting tested for covid, if it comes back positive I get to not eat Bc I “feel too sick” 😋😋
1542271349158199297	Well folks, I tested positive for covid. No wonder I've felt like ass the last few days :')
1486529507293028353	@gemsays The down ward move matches these kids behaviors. The first back to school after being sick for a week an guess what. Suspended. Seeing a trend. I get sick I still go to work. Even work with workers that test positive for Covid. Hope all stay that way for you!
1429955946948747267	I was diagnosed w/COVID the day the vaccine was given EUA. Today my sis was diagnosed w/COVID, the day the vaccine received full FDA approval. So glad she’s fully vaccinated and will benefit from the amazing science of this vaccine. #GetVaccinated
1379101780517224452	Sooo... I'm not eligible for the shot for 90 days, because I had Covid. But is it 90 days from when I tested positive, or 90 days from when I got better? 🤔
1441262717717733544	@mansukhmandviya Sir, two weeks back my family got together just to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi inside our house only. Just simple pooja. 15-16 of us all vaccinated twice. Except Children below 12. But all - close to about 15 are affected by Covid. Most were admitted in hospital.
1437801572969242626	I don't agree with the idea that booster shots aren't necessary.   These scientists saying that think it's ok to get covid as long as you don't end up severely sick or hospitalized.   F that.  I don't want to be sick with covid period.  Make more vaccine!
1315406010429984768	@Calder197 @PutTheShpudsOn @1pnt21gigawatts @Channel4News @freddiehobart No they did not and there are medications that mitigate the infection, COVID-19 is new and as far as I am aware there is no cure, no vaccine, I have discounted the Trump episode, frankly the whole thing makes very little sense, probably the test was a false positive.
1474736685372035079	Namjin have also been diagnosed w covid :( get well my babies https://t.co/gH69D0kRTW
1428055638656131079	"""I’ve got COVID. I’ve already been in the hospital for ten days and doesn’t look like I’m going to get out anytime soon,"" said Griffin.  He shudders to think what might have happened had he not been vaccinated. https://t.co/bF14bYl3B6"
1454871416172695555	@NinaStump @SenatorBraun I so disagree . I'm totally vaxxed and broke my leg, had surgery and had to go to rehab for just under 2 weeks. Came home ,within 24 hours I was diagnosed with covid and  being older and having a couple compromising conditions could have made it go either way Vax up folks!
1476579801548869634	Now that I finally got my 2nd COVID-19 shot, now I feel more confident being out there. I've already been tested positive for COVID-19 back in mid September 2021 (with mild symptoms, no hospital visit).Not sure if I plan to get the booster anytime soon but who knows...
1490736237099065344	@Bariiiiiq @Syngrafeas__ i took a lot of pictures of the same positive covid test while wearing different shirts just for this
1374386077880885250	@GovRonDeSantis Ron you're an idiot!! Allowing a super spreader such as spring break &amp; bragging what a great job you've done?? Moron!! Let's see in a couple weeks how many die or get hospitalized because of Covid transmission from spring breakers. I hope if anyone gets it it's YOU  w/ symptoms!
1473033229607350272	Hi Whitehouse,I am one of the Unvaccinated Americans. I caught #COVID19 in Dec 2020 I was better in a couple days, did not get hospitalized and am clearly not dead so stop with the fear mongering already Signed,Unvaccinated American  #DoNotComplyEVER #VaccineSideEffects https://t.co/emsdNvXY7G
1376590073370718209	@afbranco Ivermectin C&amp;D Vitamins would help him back on his feet.I thank you Jesus that your name and faith in your name heals. In the name of Jesus, I rebuke Covid and I command the person in hospital to be healed. Covid, witter and die in the name of Jesus. I pray health into him. Amen
1444560842414964742	@DrKarlynB @RubinReport Then they get sick w/Covid, bcs unvaccinated +no mask = infection, n they rush to the hospital to get treated. Been in ICU for 15 yr and am done. I worked hard the last 2 yr in a Covid unit, w/no break, unsafe situations. I am done. 1 less nurse to care for the irresponsibles.
1464791287236902912	Soo multiple people I’ve spoken to have had people treat positive or become sick after gathering this week for Thanksgiving If you are feeling sick please get tested and isolate from others. We really need to minimize spreading COVID over the next few weeks. Please be vigilant
1478863188376576003	@DiamondCRanch5 @Leerose1985 Hospitalized with COVID doesn't mean the hospitalization wasn't caused by COVID. I'm not sure how you think that's a gotcha unless you just have really poor English language skills.
1418041534923124740	My boy them on lock down he said somebody tested positive for COVID 😩😢🙏🏽
1375774549820719106	I strongly believe it helped me with not getting severe effects of covid nor transmission as household's back in Pakistan have started to get symptoms. One couple unable to come back as they tested positive 5 days after I arrived! And I hugged and kissed them bye. God's grace
1519044672697556993	@ReicherStephen It’s so utterly ridiculous to compare a deadly terror attack with deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test, it beggars belief anyone would try, and then expect to be taken seriously.I mean, if you’d spent a decade prior to 2020 doing the same for influenza maybe.But..
1460176036432334848	@Pete_Allison I had Covid in August then visited Reykjavik for a holiday when I came back I tested positive again, for a country that's so clean and fresh air I was surprised, get well soon
1525340707032268800	@sarahvmac I was supposed to be in Bali. Turned back at melb airport as one of my party tested positive for covid. Rescheduled to July now. So will watch the coverage at home, not in a bar in Kuta sadly.
1386749897190297600	@VividRicky @JeremyVineOn5 Covid loony alert!28000 people die every day in India, 2000 had a positive covid test before they died and yet somehow you think that the shortfalls in Indian medical care equates to the UK!An odd person wore a yellow star, stupid but after a year of stupidity Im not surprised!
1352624489843011585	So, after nearly a year of being a terribly bored and anxious hermit, I tested positive for Covid yesterday. Ironically, my timeline suggests I was exposed while standing in line for two hours waiting for my first dose of the vaccine. Symptoms are mild, thankfully. Sigh.
1429915645714571272	The first thing he asked for when they admitted him into the hospital was the #CovidVaccine.  The doctors had to tell him it was already too late.  He has three kids.  He's in his mid 30s.  Far too young to die.  My heart hurts for him and his family.
1500994041680482312	@McpeakRichie Awesome thank you. I just got diagnosed with long covid and MCAS and looking for supplements so I would appreciate trying anything!
1379812564352311310	@BretBaier @DrMarcSiegel I’m lucky then. 1 week in the hospital with Covid and I recovered 100%. Hydroxychloroquine worked wonders for me.
1385303622297264131	@Claire_G_ @dodgegrl411 I talked to her a little last night. She had been in the hospital a week ago. She was really sick, not covid. It just hit her really hard. She was better, it just didn't last and now is in icu. I'll stop there as I don't want her to yell at me for sharing tmi 😂!!
1480572262419947525	In the end, she opted not to do so and in late August, after taking a patient who had COVID to a local upstate NY hospital, she herself was hospitalized. I remember seeing a few posts on Facebook as she detailed her declining health but I was busy in my first medical school class
1488560039417765890	Btw i tested positive for covid 2 days ago
1466484756170907655	@MAW1212 @ZielaskowskiM @Mike_Pence I would also like you to keep in mind, in 2020, if your were in a car accident and died and tested positive for Covid, the cause of death was Covid. As long as you had Covid at the time of death, it was used as the cause of death. If your in NY, you know this. That stopped 2021.
1519526354492043264	literally have two days left of the semester, i was so close to finally NOT having a traumatic event happen and then BAM i test positive for covid 😭😭😭
1465017646022160385	Confession: I heard that the govco artist tested positive for COVID
1432867218467995649	@WolfwoodGaming @Hope4TTRPGS @PrintInkling @penguin_uncle @arielleishere I donated what I could and shared. Thank you for tagging me. With my work in the hospital and our surge in COVID cases, I'm not as present and miss so much. 💚
1381427935710748673	@ggreenwald @mehdirhasan It's stated on the box that these medical masks are in, that they do not prevent us from contracting Covid. In the hospital facility that I'm employed by, I overheard a physician state the same. And the cloth ones so many are wearing? Lmao 🤣
1392914217460699139	So, I tested negative for COVID, but positive for everything else. Thank God the VA is single payor. I don’t have to worry about filing bankruptcy along with the rest of it. The VA’s the best!!!
1462685168469254148	My Covid test was positive plz I don’t wanna have Covid
1460278455455690759	@kokeshimum @Paulathon1 @talkRADIO My point was more pneumonia is a massive killer, and affects children far worse than Covid. And in 2017/18 where thousands of children were being rushed to hospital we were expected just to get on with it, no masks, no lockdown etc. There’s even a vaccine but wasn’t pushed.
1379060478824046593	@jshsndfrdBB @zed5152 @WeWillBeFree82 @BorisJohnson I said she was severely ill you idiot, can’t you read? Yes, she was lucky where others aren’t. But let’s not forget 150k who had a positive test in past 28 days. If I tested positive today &amp; got ran over 27 days from now, I’d be a covid death!
1506677329380229126	"This talking point of ""incidental"" covid infections in hospital is a little fucking evil though isn't it? If I'm in hospital because I'm already pretty fucking sick and I catch covid, that's not fucking incidental, hun, that's potentially fatal."

1477990055054651396	@PhilJenkins_ Posting as I would like to follow this thread. In the meantime, 2 years in, UK office of national statistics says of over 13 million children 19 or younger, a total of 14 healthy children have died within 28 days of a positive covid test https://t.co/YmPdKKkhvp
1397787775852679168	My partner has to stay overnight in the ER (we don’t think it’s covid) so that’s where I’ll be, if I can’t deliver the rest of my commissions a week from now I’ll make arrangements for refunds. Thanks.
1504470035795828742	I’ve had a right week tested positive for Covid ( for the second time In 3 weeks) and I’ve broken my finger now
1389003225370697732	"Person- lives with person who tested positive for covid and just found out. Person- doesn't wear a mask in a drive thru because ""I'm in my car"". Bitch if someone doesn't put some sense into you....🙃 Sorry. I didn't know covid knew it wasn't allowed to leave your car. My bad."
1478492849746300930	I’ve had to get tested twice in the last 4 days after being around people that tested positive for covid . Where a fucking mask and stay home if you aren’t feeling well . Not everyone can afford to miss work if they get sick . Stop going out if you have yet to receive results.
1440312676077371405	I got Covid, which developed into double pneumonia, which caused me to be hospitalized for two and a half weeks. Sitting in that room alone with very little to occupy my time gave me the longest opportunity to be alone with my thoughts.
1476242259104317442	@hobzzz For work I had to test 2X/week. I got COVID. Told to quarantine for 10 days. I was still sick and was told it was OK to go out anyway. Then I was told not to test anymore for work until after 90 days because I was still likely to test positive. ????? 😜🤡
1429054154798993409	One night his fever intensified, and his voice was injured by coughs . Then suddenly he was dragged from his home to the hospital, She told me maybe he took the wrong covid vaccine . Maybe he was poisoned!A week went.. she was terrified. When is he gonna die?
1388520393552515075	Postural Tachycardia has been found in people recovering from Covid19, it happens after viral infections. I was diagnosed with #pots and if you may have symptoms, talk to your Doctor l. It’s rare, but needs more awareness ❤️ https://t.co/CGbQ7zPlkF

1419135197971353603	@SenTedCruz I’m imagining just a small sample of people-- perhaps 5000 --marching in unison into a hospital, saying, “We tested positive for COVID on an antibody test…and then we had to isolate, and some of us were treated with toxic drugs…and NOW we learn that the antibody test is useless
1384257888739229697	@Pehtrica @MJGerson @MaxBoot Most people who can't breathe I assume would seek medical intervention.  I'm not saying everyone who gets CoVid gets that bad.  But those that do would go to hospital.  what do you say?
1379932967951212549	@jnpdx Right, like if a person is admitted to the hospital w COVID is there a formal process in place to query about vaccination status? I hope so but I’d be surprised.
1427697794123456518	@amethystarlight @IowaGOP @KimReynoldsIA @IAGovernor It would be great if we could have leaders with intellectual curiosity. I do not see how having your voters die in a pandemic is helpful, but here we are. Rep Holt telling me yesterday that HIS WIFE was in hospital 6 days w Covid was staggering for me.
1388248290857267202	@TheEconomist There are already ~2.5 million Americans with ME/CFS, a post-viral illness closely related to long covid. About 1/3 of people with long covid are getting diagnosed with it. We’ve LONG needed accommodations for chronically ill people in the work place, glad a dialogue is happening
1388589964301066240	@DrGodseRavi1 Hello Doctor, नमस्कारI had tested positive in RT-PCr on 12th April. In 10 days my all symptoms gone. But since last three days, from 29 April, I have sour throat infection. Do I have Covid again? Pls suggest do I need go for PCR? Thank you
1387115956464504833	@davenewworld_2 I know someone who listens to his podcast and actually began believing Covid wasn’t a big deal, got lax about masks and caught it. Almost ended up in the hospital and now has heart issues. Said he regrets ever listening to that bs and now it’s too late. Smh it’s dangerous.
1380650581790875649	@Hoping4change56 @matthewdurkee21 @seanspicer Chance of vaccine injury - .000002%. Infection fatality rate from covid 1.8%. For the original strain at least, we’ll see about the new ones. Now 30/40 year olds are being admitted to the hospital at a much higher rate with the mutations. I’m 42, I feel lucky to be protected.

1446255983236419584	@RT_com I know why it is, it's because they are likely to catch covid while spending a lot of time in hospital recovering and them sorts of operation and covid infection has a high death rate,,, going to have to wait until the pandemic is over or get the jabs
1542888488747556865	@Sachinettiyil Please pray for me. I came to Lourdes to serve the sick as I do every year and I tested positive for Covid and have to isolate in my hotel.  My service this year is Bernadette’s : prayer
1481274361881546754	@lastdanceszn I think the serial number discrepancy of the tests is a big red flag as to the validity of the test. It’s not automatic to get Covid from a moment with someone who is positive.
1414607826245279746	My boss on Friday was cornering people to give them the whole “if I was older and in worse shape i’d get the vaccine; but I’m not so I won’t” shtickSomeone in his office tested positive for Covid today, so the whole place is closed and I’m alone deep cleaning the place 🙄🙄🙄

1420908510624329729	@RonFilipkowski He just tested positive for covid if I'm not mistaken. Why is he not isolating instead of trying to go into a facility where a large amt of people reside? Why is he walking to the Senate office in a large group?

1443604934910308352	@appreciatecats @GovGianforte Actually no… it isn’t. The people I work with that are fully Vaccinated have tested positive for Covid.
1482154818081005570	@slbeckett @picsiechick @j_mcelroy That doesn't exactly add up though. Around half of those hospitalized with COVID are incidental cases, admitted for other reasons then tested positive. So I'd have expected this adjustment to have doubled the number.

1545917006305787904	I have two broken ankles, tested positive for Covid (after being vaxed and boosted) and my boss still wants me to work remotely.  Scared not to.  I need my job.  I have bills.
1480182864700313602	@Tazinjcksn44 @MarkGlasstette5 @LakotaMan1 Data shows that unvaccinated are the majority hospitalized and dying. Vaccines help keep you alive even if you get covid. I'd call you stupid for not knowing this, but I'm a mature adult. You sound like a teenager- grow up.
1326980640726659072	@Human85894078 @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump I’d rather call it creative. Van Gough cut if his ear  👂 but everyone knows his name. Creativity lives in Trump.

1426118259850588164	Spot on. I honestly think we have reached a point now where the anti-vaccers are so toxic to this world they Should be Denied Medical Treatment. Most of the world aged over 30 has at least 1 vaccine dose, so anyone coming to hospital with COVID without it should be turned away.

1611164804332519425	I love advances in science, the last time I had Covid I had to go to the hospital and get an infusion…. Now they have antiviral pills for it. If my pharmacy would stop taking 12 years to fill it, this would be much easier!
1478524305503838210	4 days into 2022 and I tested positive for covid!😩😩 this year is not looking good
1383941404527775746	Rare personal update in hopes that folks here know where the research is happening on breakthrough cases. @CDCgovI have tested positive for #COVID -19.Based on what I’ve read, odds of a false positive PCR test are nearly 100x more likely than what I’m experiencing.
1382341993041338371	@ArjunB9591 One of my colleague also tested positive for Covid 19 following which i also got tested as a preventive measure. Report will be available tomorrow. Wish me luck.
1518548757104799744	@BoxedChai UMMMMM ….. totally didn’t show up to my lesson this morning unknowing that my tutor tested positive for covid ………
1427522938992046090	As an ER Physician I’ve DEFINITELY ran into a fair share of people who have been critically ill with COVID and didn’t believe that’s what it was they had. Some of them died shortly after being diagnosed and I’m pretty sure they never accepted that’s what they had
1380929618891378689	I hope I dnt test positive for covid 😩
1586384175837642752	@SimRelic @S55Ann @CBCAlerts @CBCNews I never lost my freedom for 2 plus years and was never sick ,or in the hospital on a ventilator dying from covid oh and I had a job. So don't know what your say by we lost our Freedom..The people who fought in wars who died for OUR country lost there freedom.  🐑 go away
1432078200444751882	Just found out another student in one of my classes tested positive for covid and is super sick. My heart hurts for these kids.
1515930987695247360	I tested positive for COVID-19 today. This is a breakthrough case as I'm fully vaccinated and boosted. I've  geared up &amp; am all set to defeat it!Reminder: The cases are on the rise, &amp; the pandemic is not over. Please continue to take necessary precautions to ensure safety. ❤️
1438526931222155267	@TheFarquaad @KateGallicano @BCGovNews So 134 people are in ICU.  And that’s sad. In a large province   A province that originally promised all Provincial tax would go to health care.   Because of this I can’t go to restaurants pub or go watch hockey etc.  Even though I had Covid.  Have immunity.  Exactly the same.
1476567892976152579	Positive in late October, negative the following week. Testing unnecessary for my blood test and infusion in two weeks. then? #COVID19 #Crohns  (My choice, before entering a hospital setting.)

I know exactly how hard times with loved ones in hospital can be at the best of times but to have covid restrictions impact on these situations must be pushing many families to their limits.

1482804886303563788	@POTUS I’m 0% likely to be hospitalized for Covid. What’s 17 X 0?Also doesn’t matter because that stat is horsepaste
1471214712306249738	@borisstupidhair @jackiefromaccy @owencfcc @piersmorgan What danger? Why are concerned of the chose another person makes about what they put in their body. Who are to to decided that fact. I will give a fact to think about. I am not vaccinated, caught covid twice,8 months,antibody test done,results today tested positive, what danger?
1516874575878963201	@fleshpillow @lou_weed_ Once you’re the second person I know who got diagnosed with covid on 4/20. What is happening?!?!
1481461995236958209	@MoonHowler71 you can tell him this too. My husband is double vaxed and only goes to work,  wears  a mask and gloves at work and he still got Covid literally tested positive today!! Mask are worthless

I'm wondering why you think it's necessary to use the term ""breakthrough COVID"". 🤔"
1473083684425240583	@dvassarjr @CreeksideWood @KatiePavlich What’s your point? I only know 3 professional athletes who were hospitalized with covid, all 3 vaccinated.  If your under 40 you chance of being hospitalized as an unvaccinated person is 0.4%.  Probably 100 times less if your a professional athletes
1386642525671264256	@BenQuin62369463 @mptonyjohnson @JuliaHB1 @devisridhar No it isn't. Data has never been released splitting those admitted due to Covid, those who tested positive in hospital but there for another reason and those who tested positive in hospital that needed treatment for Covid. I wonder why...
1444878367061389315	literally did not sleep last night I think I was way too nervous about my covid test coming back positive for like absolutely no reason
1344264365290237953	@JonathanKBall If one's already had Covid19 is immunity same as having the vaccine?I had C19 in March &amp; tested positive for antibodies using both the Abbotts &amp; BioZek antibody tests.No one taking about natural immunity only vaccinated immunity.What is the current thinking?
1373635881656061955	@islivingston Same here but for shot 1 of Moderna. I am pretty sure I had COVID in December. I never tested positive but all 4 of my family members in the house did and I was sick too. So I'm hoping shot 1 was basically my big reaction shot and shot 2 will be no biggie.
1429569377003782147	@gothgirlkarter @stand4theflag3 @holiday_roads @LMAOILoveIt @GovRonDeSantis So they are still going to the hospital? Hmmm... get a jab or just get a treatment IF I get covid. With a 98-99% survival rate. I'll wait. 2% doesn't scare me.
1375324061547458560	"Sigh. They're putting him back in the hospital.  Covid did something to his prostate and he's in a lot of pain so theyre going to do a scan tomorrow and maybe surgery. And I say ""covid did"" because he had a full physical 2 wks before covid and there were no issues."
1446218041100943384	@Melika__pouyan It is pretty full on, that kind of violence. I don’t condone it.These are testosterone fuelled anti-vaxxers who have been defacing our cities &amp; monuments. A lot of them are in hospital with covid now because they spread it at their violent protests.
1549530942393417730	"So after a week of having covid I have to call to make sure my leave is going alright. Turns out they haven't accepted home tests as ""viable"" since april 1st so I had to get tested again today. Still testing positive I call back to find out what to do with the leave..."
1485169339338797058	so 2 years of dodging covid I’ve finally tested positive and I’m really ill with it 😞😞😞 hopefully I don’t get any worse but today is a sad sunday

1476270156414398468	Negative covid test , I’ve flu but lucky I had my flu jab if I hadn’t I’d likely be in hospital

1523130296874328064	@natratt30 Hi, sorry to hear. I retweeted your article. The HIV test may be a false positive, a lot of covid survivors report false+ HIV tests.Also look at this article, covid may be chronic in the gutLook into it and test and perhaps use IVMhttps://t.co/Rj6NR6MypR
1392505007409221632	@niyaf Today I have met you near ER and thanks for your help to fast track to consult doc for my kid. Unfortunately today @ADKHospital has issued NEGATIVE test and just now received a called and informed me it was false report. Its POSITIVE for covid. Please check this matter
1478773531202752519	@The_Pale_H0rse I’m against the fat shaming but I think we need to have real conversations about obesity prevention/intervention in this country. Imagine if we spent the amount we spent on covid on obesity? I’d have 2/3rd fewer pts in the hospital.
1437853121624121355	@trutherbleuchef The only people I know who had tested positive for Covid and were sick were already unhealthy or obese.
1573494463120359425	Lol I tested positive for COVID 🙃
1376691053126893570	i’m legit scared the dosage of the meds government sends to you if you’re covid positive is insane 💀 8 tablets every morning and night? TF?? i’m praying so hard for my test rn lmfao🧍‍♀️
1423286691066900490	@espiers This past year in NYC if a kid tested positive in the school and the class had to quarantine, the city covid trackers called and offered to send a test in the mail. A bit slow for my comfort but there was some limited effort in this direction.
1335686702736793605	@DebbeeHutchins1 @krisardav5 I thought all those with symptoms tested positive for Covid. These were nearly all in the placebo group. Very few receiving the vaccine developed symptoms but we don't know if they were still infected and could pass it on.
1476140232089034756	So two people at my work tested positive for covid both jabbed!
1421088503874605058	@NancyMace Then please tell me how do you get people to deliberately not go around potentially infecting people with this virus. You had Covid. Maybe you had a mild case of it. But there are many people who get deathly ill from it , end up in the hospital or even worse. How do you stop it?
1431187348696584195	@CiaraMacLaverty @fascinatorfun I have covid. None of my family is required to self-isolate under Gov guidance until they get a positive test result, even though they could be unknowingly contagious. Husband is exempt because he is double jabbed. Children are aged 14 and 12, so could theoretically be in school.
1439225180778205185	@DavidDBottrell @WajahatAli @donwinslow Israel has an 85% vaccination rate yet has one of the highest infection and death rates from Covid. Four out of five people hospitalized in Israel have been vaccinated. So tell me how the vaccine works 👉🏼https://t.co/tHhZY1Yfw1

1374769493768089604	Joy I go back to Dallas on Friday for Covid test then on Monday I go for my Cardio finally. I was supposed to do Cardio back in February but I was in the hospital. Bad thing about driving for the Covid test it takes a second for a hour and a half drive. Ugh 🤦‍♀️

I also know children that have gotten pretty sick and been hospitalized.
1387186902273458176	@BilowJoe @CTVNews Let me guess, you think there ICU are over run again, right? There's 3x FEWER covid people in the hospital right now than the first wave. Wisen up kid
1426921273892999169	This is the kind of crowd I’m driving through at 130 mph in my brand new 2021 vehicle if I test positive for COVID. After beating a few anti maskers to death with my metal baseball bat. This isn’t a joke. No lies. #Promise #Retribution

1429866499037089799	@craft_ang The flu didn't disappear.  It's here right now.  RSV.  Rhino virus.  Tons of kids getting sick.  That is disinfo.  The news focuses on COVID and makes it appear this way.  I do think people are getting diagnosed with COVID who don't have it, but that doesn't make it not real.
1478374363921539079	This is going to sound so strange but I almost hope I test positive Thursday bc I just hate how my boss acted like I was just over reacting to being sick even tho I had almost all the covid symptoms
1383116021985202178	almost everyday someone from my inner circle tell me that one of their peers has test covid positive. I hope there isn't a day when  it breaches this inner circle....

Sooo like your point?”Lol, also IT’S ONE MF DONUT A DAY. you’re fine
1362949992445599744	@TheRealHoarse Exposed to covid at work. Patient tested negative. We coded him for 2 hours. Multiple rounds of CPR. Shocked 12 times. He survived. Two days later he was tested again before a procedure and he was positive. I waited 7 days and got tested. I was negative. Thank you vaccine!!!

1417971379945754624	@TinTop7 @LeonydusJohnson I had COVID in October before they started talking about in the media. Two months ago had a positive on my government test. I get tested every two weeks. Most deaths that occurred from COVID were with people who have pre-existing conditions.
1423011045195476994	@KanionTitus @peterdaou 20 children!!! 20!! In the ENTIRE city of St Louis, there are TWENTY hospitalized children!! Are you trying to tell me there was never a period in time PRIOR to covid that there was twenty children in the ICU because of influenza? The ENTIRE WORLD is supposed to shut down for 20?
1387045754565394436	I haven't seen any stories about this but am thinking about the health care cost burden on those who have been hospitalized with COVID, or with long COVID. Came to mind while writing  $1300 check for well care.
1481233634330030082	@elisethoma5 But surely not if the covid test is a ‘faked’ positive. Either way my theory is it’s fake but it’s better for him to maintain its real and take the Serbian ‘punishment’ on the nose (‘breaching iso rules’) and try for the win / $$ with AO. But also I don’t care that much lol

1453828753122070529	@r8dr4lfe75 Math doesn’t make sense. Also the vaccine doesn’t prevent you from getting COVID. It does raise awareness because you’re more likely to get tested and more likely to see a result. I also the unvaxed shouldn’t go to the hospital if they get it. I mean why? Trust your system. Fair?
1345031002817581061	@Jopo_dr @SARA2001NOOR Joanna, thank you so much for this vivid reality of covid in the hospital.  I hope people listen. Much if our small community refuses to mask. I stay home but mask and social distance when out for essentials, and I’m waiting for my turn to take the vaccine. 💖
1471910256640987144	Seeing as Covid isn’t going away and we have to learn to live with it…I am hoping scientists will figure out a way people who test positive and feel fine can just go about their normal business as with a Cold or Flu with proper hygiene.
1383042400692666368	Cannot imagine real covid hitting me, probably would of sent me to the hospital. Zero regrets on the vaccine just prepare to have a variety of reactions.

1380872964166582280	I heard that people who tested positive for covid react more to the second shot.I skipped the gym this morning, which means I have more time to get work done at the office. I have no idea how I am going to feel over the course of the day. 2/2 #StillHappyToBeFullyVaccinated
1376635059298525187	@Cameron03482305 @mptonyjohnson @mattblake94 @JamesMelville No post mortems are being done on anyone who’s tested positive so how can they confirm it’s a covid death? Ah yes because of their positive pcr test, which may I add are highly flawed anyway.

1326658968765214728	@piersmorgan Has anyone checked those currently in hospital with Covid and whether they have had the flu vaccine. Would be interesting to see if none of them have had the flu vaccine. Could it be possible the flu vaccine also prevents Covid. I don’t know, just asking the question.

1603217937107914753	@clg6000 I had a negative PCR test the same day as my positive antigen test, then lost my sense of smell a day or two later. I realize other things can cause anosmia. I'm pretty sure I had covid, but was traveling so didn't have access to my regular clinic at the time.
1550955642227154948	@joshtpm I haven’t tested positive for covid, but I don’t know how any of us can say for sure we’ve never had it if it can be asymptomatic. I’m quadruple vaxxed, live alone and work from home.
1429398348608544769	@zeppi771 @PatTheBerner @BNeidhardt There is a three week lag, getting diagnosed with covid doesn't mean you die the same day. There's no way you don't know this, so I can only assume you're being disingenuous.
1386820609439588354	My associate got very sick after taking the covid-19 vaccine. He maybe in the hospital. This is your new world order killing off as many people as it can and destroying world economies. Wake up folks. This is why I don't take the vaccine. I keep my immune system strong.
1611209168546893824	@the_jjofficial @PunkyPie23 It sure is.. I don't want it EVER again/Hoping/Praying I'm NEGATIVE by Monday Bec he said if not he'd likely have 2 put me In the hospital/That's just 2 RISKY. Our rural hospitals are FULL OF COVID, FLU/RSV. I'd catch the other 2 my luck/no immune system self! So no Thk Ya! https://t.co/wg45EyFQEp
1479240006464016384	ny mutuals…what is the isolation period if u test positive for covid i cannot find a straightforward answer anywhere
1442661077515395077	@tedcruz I don’t know about you, but if I’m admitted to the hospital, I would expect at least the medical staff would do everything to keep me safe &amp; Covid free.If the medical staff doesn’t want to take precautions to keep their patients, then maybe they should change occupations.
1486931368705552385	@EtihadHelp URGENT! I tested positive for covid. Do you accept a recovery letter
1446867046067810311	@BohemianAtmosp1 @TJ0056 Thats not true the folks who were in icu with covid had elevated blood clotting serum in the their bloods, and the front line icu were chasing clots around, i got this direct of a front line very experienced icu nurse who was anti jab anti lockdown and a  good christian man.
1560293559583924224	@SteveBarclay I caught Covid last year and had to be taken to hospital by ambulance. I live in fear of it happening again. You do know you could cut hospitalisation of immunocompromised by 92% by authorising the use of #evusheld don't you? Wouldn't that help? Oh, and I could get my life back!

1506424128500383744	MY big takeaway from this is that the reduction in pediatric deaths proves quite substantially that children 0-17yo are not at risk for being hospitalized with or dying from Covid. https://t.co/sDaAcXjy6t

1328000271457398786	@Suzanne94743599 @TomSyvret The government haven’t bought enough stock for everyone; their working on a 45% take up for the NHS to then be able to cope with Covid. There will be no forced vaccine. I’ve been sectioned in hospital, even then when they’re legally in control of u, they cannot force drugs!!
1471605352688926721	@sandieshoes West end theatres have only closed, because too many of the cast have now tested positive for Covid. We are certainly in for an interesting month ahead I think.

1430840322196656135	@BrendaGStafford @RealCandaceO I mean… uh I can’t find any unjabbed covid recovered person reinfected and hospitalized. i.e-seems the recovered are doing much better than club jab jab.
1472146128527368192	Looks like a lonely Christmas Day for me - tested positive for COVID today ☹️☹️☹️
1433524778535694338	@RealCandaceO My brief anecdote. 50% of the covid patients I saw in the hospital were vaccinated. 100% were morbidly obese
1429084653357608965	I wonder if whoever actually had Covid 3 times or they just continued to test positive for a while bc it was in their system still
1448209904330854403	I’m sure it did circulate last year, just diagnosed as “Covid”!  Like every other annual virus, it came under’Covid’ diagnosis!
1427625542338105361	A reminder that one year ago today Scotland had a total of 26 covid cases, 5 people in hospital and 0 deaths.Today we have 1815 cases, 338 in hospital and 9 deaths.Yet as Schools return this week all I see around me is folk acting like covid has all but gone.#CovidIsNotOver https://t.co/qRt5IWxnGY

It’s the vax !
1473014206035337219	Today I went and got a COVID-19 test. I encourage you to go get your COVID-19 test, especially before visiting family even, if you’re #vaccinated and #boosted.

1443834981948723200	@Soulgirl1RN @YardleyShooting I'd like to know ALL stats. Tell us about every case pneumonia on a daily update. Why shouldn't we know this?

1348474172092121093	@ighaworth im going to put this out there but they tracked you down and came to your house because a piece of dog poop you stepped in tested positive for corona. They dont need shit to give you a vaccine.
1444888076631818242	"@Progressive_RN @Brian41311970 @elvisthecatlady @Drailxthecircus That's operating under the assumption that everyone who gets sick, even severely sick, actually goes to the hospital. Lots of folks die at home, and I suspect a lot of strokes &amp; heart attacks were brought on by clots from Covid (which can happen even in ""milder"" cases)"
1375895393695850498	@LikeTheMountain I got covid Feb 29th in the hospital 4 dayssince coming home i am constantly tired. Horrible!

1339374284062351360	"“This vaccine means a lot. I know it may seem scary, but it’s for the benefit of everyone,” said Merope Duffin, Emergency Department nurse at @KPSanDiego. “It’s been a very long and challenging year in the ER, and this vaccine means seeing an end to the pandemic."" #COVIDvaccine https://t.co/8lDJJAeUHL"
1422437717816745985	I learned yesterday that while a typical ICU patient stays in ICU for 3 days, a typical Covid ICU patient stays in ICU for 2-4 weeks. This puts incredible strain on ICU resources.
1558839204070793216	I hate Covid!!! Just tested positive for the 3rd time in 2 years...and yes I have had all 3 shots. FML.
1479972107488481280	@philwrite @RichardCityNews Yes except when the vaccine came out they claimed you had a very very little chance to even contract Covid,  and it would keep you out of hospital.  Now we have 1,400 vaxxed in hospital plus 150 more in ICU.  I would say it failed its primary and secondary purposes
1557906782663479297	@CoClarified Wow I was just on the CDC this week bc we got hit with round 2 of covid.  I was quarantining since 8/2 after my husband tested positive.  Theb the boy last Saturday. I tested positive on Monday.  I finally get to go back to my office next week.
1372587271275360262	DUDE IN THE HOSPITAL ROOM NEXT TO ME HAS COVID  L M A O KILL ME
1374752003075756033	Well, yeah... and?The point of the vaccine isn’t so you never test positive for COVID-19. The point, to make a long story short, is so you basically don’t feel the impact of COVID if you do happen to contract it.I’m sure this will have to be repeated time and time again. Sigh
1485690409351147524	@MissRey0826 If you have Covid you test positive for up to 90 days. Lots of liquids Advil and vitamins. I was only down a couple of days. Mind you we had Covid in the beginning Good luck

1473376052621807623	@bowtiedninja @soi6robert @Zeitich @MartinKulldorff This data is probably just the product of our crappy tests and false positives. I highly doubt they took the time to confirm every positive test as a true COVID infection. We need the details.
1587749753273847808	Day 105This evening I finally went to the hospital to see a doctor.He said it was probably gastroenteritis.I am glad it was not coronavirus.
1439598326739976198	@katiephelps_ @wendybastard @CeeRose__ Not in the last 3 years, I work with a big team of people no ones died or even been particularly ill when they've tested positive for covid but this cough/cold that's going around was worse for other young and healthy people
1545122243537260544	@jlkragt @alexmeshkin FYI - when I had COVID in December, the CDC told us not to attest as we would test positive for three months and tbat I would most likely be a false positive.
1420164425147768832	Sorry I didn't include in original, but also feel bad for ppl who wanted to get vax but couldn't bc of accessibility or other reasons out of their control and ended up hospitalized/with covid. And ppl who did everything right and still got fucked over by ppl who didn't care
1448328953912045569	Just got the Covid result...I have tested positive 😭😭😭Quarantine for 7 days now...and postponing a trip to see my girlfriend. I AM going to beat this. Thank you to all who are standing behind me. To anyone dealing with Covid or anything else, I stand with you too.

1419289795994476547	I am legit interested in this denial so many antivaxxers suffer from, even dying from COVID in the ICU. Is there any layman-accessible psychological analysis somewhere? I imagine something similar happened in the past with other epidemics/pandemics
1386016664966283268	@MNHockeymama @Christy56074523 @GardenSage @greta The first part of that: There was this lady where I work who wouldn't leave her apartment for almost a year, until she got vaccinated.  Had her second shot and within a couple days was hospitalized w/ covid... She spent a few days in the hospital I believe she is back now...
1475993347206623238	My daytime nurse's aide has tested positive for Covid and I'm sure I have it.  I will not survive this due to several underlying conditions.  At 78, I feel mostly immense agony at what young people and children shall encounter in the future.  I am sad.
1420130140881891328	@plarp_his_bees I also had it twice different varients. I did work in a covid wars for one, but I tested positive after being fired for medical reasons. Cant actually prove where I got it.

1387582931603009537	@uvagurl Thank you so much.  We meet with the doctors at 10:30 to discuss options.  Damn nurses upset me, they said 80% of Covid patients die.  He has only been in ICU about 36 hours.
1378041912414904325	@onlygracie I _guess_ that’s the sign of a healthy immune system? Good luck, though.I’ve likely been exposed to COVID, so might have antibodies. Wife treats patients all day and her assistant came up positive a while back. Neither of us got sick, though neither tested either.
1481285328149401604	@checkingmates @Independent_ie Let me help you out there. It’s the law in Serbia and is punishable by up to 3 years in prison. So the pcr positive test from dec 16 is fake or he knowingly exposed people to Covid. One of these things is true. Novak couldn’t lie straight in bed,

1377124212863721477	I know someone who got the vaccine[s] a long time ago and tested positive for COVID recently. That is all.
1379203378987814914	I’m indebted to @CBoyForeman for figures on NHS cancer treatment during Covid. Yes, waiting lists have grown horribly. Covid has been a disaster for both patients being diagnosed and starting treatment, but it’s wrong to say they’ve been abandoned.https://t.co/y2q26bHJAD
1506792941079179272	@RealMacReport When COVID firsts came out, this was hypothesized. I saw it when Tom Hanks tested positive. I wonder if there’s any truth to this seeing as how NBC reported that Hillary used her SECSTATE position to sweep pedophilia under the rug. https://t.co/wZc9THvzbX

1382868587707129857	@ScifiCommons I have never tested positive for covid. Was sick after first. But react to ALL shots. Had slight reaction to second, as expected for me but not like 1st
1452630769587871746	@Mildenpk @CP24 lol... No, I never said that either. Being vaccinated ( in Covid-19 ) case is more about getting enough immunity not to end up in ICU. No one can guarantee you 100% protection from Covid-19... Covid-19 vaccine is not a magic potion... It is the best remedy under the circumstances

1449445025679646725	@VolumeRose @chrischirp This is because the test would have detected the dead fragments of the virus in my system. Surely you can see how that alone proves my point? I'd have tested positive, but wouldn't have had covid or been infectious because the test is too sensitive.

I described on the weekend an 11 year old testing positive for Covid when all he ended up having was constipation.
1341013345248403459	Woot woot!! @moderna_tx #vaccine is getting shipped right now!This gives me such joyThinking of all the frontline providers in ICU, ER and COVID floors today ❤️😷https://t.co/ruSYooAv3I
1483175138698932225	@Katyloveslabs Within 28 days of a positive test... car crash and had a positive day before counted as positive figures. 17000 of covid that's it. Illegal treatment will be stopped soon. I'm very confident on that.Once the emergency act runs out in a few weeks no one needs to isolate, why?
1412379278474424322	"@oro7777777 @StickyDrawer @DMinghella The sentence after that one refers to people who haven't tested positive for covid 19: ""This was eight times higher than in a control group of participants who are unlikely to have had COVID-19"". I don't what your problem is tbh"
1443914451430912004	@ShittySuze They most certainly do. I fractured my ankle back in April &amp; had to go to hospital. Even though there were covid restrictions in place, they still dealt with me efficiently &amp; I was in &amp; out quicker than I was expecting. Waiting time was 4hrs, I was out in less than 3
1439958102447636481	@BigThingzzz @ClayTravis How about I don’t care? Just don’t take up a hospital bed unnecessarily! Again. You chose willfully to be ignorant! Many like you have gotten Covid and been hospitalized and there in lies the problem!
1485627012630855681	@cash_converters I'm writing to let u know I've tested positive for covid and visited your shipley Bradford  branch friday so your staff may want to get tested immediately Danny served me thanks
1486026830985367552	@AxelSavage4 @dontatmebru No they said that they tainted the adr*nochr*me with covid so the ppl who took it would test positive. I don't know about that and I've never claimed that.But that's still a hell of a lot more believable than you tards who think nothing is happening. Blinds ass twats
1545611499791650816	@NateJ3_2 @EricTopol @JSahly My 4 year old had to go to the children’s hospital. We had 3 positive at home tests, they didn’t give him a PCR test, and he never counted as a Covid positive yet alone a Covid hospitalization.
1428189913665576964	@keithbaldrey do you think you can get us the number or percentage of fully vaccinated BC residents who have been hospitalized due to Covid? I'm not seeing this reported anywhere.
1480103984320978945	Bruh my high school sucks two kids tested positive for covid in my art class before winter break and we didn’t even know until THREE DAYS later when our art teacher had let it slip that the school didn’t want anyone to know
1513502934893535242	I have not felt this sick in a while. I know something is wrong and I take an at home Covid test just in case! As soon as the liquid pours into the tray I see 2 lines of a positive test almost immediately. I know I’m screwed so I book a CVS test to confirm and alert work (6/?)
1384008235473014785	It's due to nobody wanting to go to the hospital! Covid lock downs ..like me I don't want to see my heart Dr because of the covid hoax...
1508307678791180295	@Jensenvalerie54 My hubs had the vax, diabetic, caught covid in Jan, 4 days of treatment in the hospital, double pneumonia, it didn't work very well, he's still recovering.
1355248771416944640	@txwhodatchic That’s great. Don’t hesitate at all. I’ve been waiting for the vaccine but instead tested positive for Covid on Monday along with pneumonia. The struggle is real.
1505069780541358084	@alanmills405 @sajidjavid Immune Compromised to. O days in hospital in November with pneumonia,  diagnosed with covid 24th Dec.  Flew through it tho,  wouldn't have known apart from my rheumatology consultant ringing me
1502672127929073671	@jasonleitch You can’t get covid if you don’t test. Bin them. Someone I know 6 positive LFT 1 negative PCR test.
1482210213092540418	I started having symptoms of COVID 10 days ago. Tested positive for flu and COVID. I've had my shots. I feel like crap. I can not imagine how bad this would be if I had not had the jabs.
1431304328678158338	@kiswanson I have been ventilated and conscious in ICU 30 years before COVID.
1381301854555021313	@TakethatCt @pocketrocket210 @AP_Loosh @snpout2021 For a PCR test not to be a false positive for Covid or not just be reflecting previous infection in a non infectious person. I thought that’s what we were talking about?
1529756746964672512	@SoniaPoulton @TheFreds @seanjward @brandnewtube Fred ended up in hospital with covid and couldn't breathe, not a good advert for nor having the vaccine, I've had all 3, not been in hospital with covid, strange that
1427892806018912259	@MrXRP6 Take it steady bud, I tested positive for covid on Sunday. Knocked me off my feet for couple days but back at it today. 💪👊
1294818445519855616	@riseupmelbourne I heard if you got the flu vaccine last year you will test positive for covid... More fake numbers to freak out about 🤦🏼‍♀️ I refuse to be tested unless I feel like I'm dying.
1465336871853117448	Just spent the last day and a half feeling awful post covid booster shot...don't think I would do well with actual covid judging from the fever, chills and asthma symptoms that the shot gave me! Still worth it instead of potentially ending up in the hospital/dead
1454031376047509508	@YouAreLobbyLud A 5% admission rate for kids to hospital from COVID.In my local primary that’s close to one child from every single classroom.

1425394743081529345	What i have seen none of these people in ICU but they can save lives by improving nurses role adopt same like before covid. Our A.P.nurses have forgotten the basic role of hospitality @ysjagan #YSJaganCares #CMYSJagan #YSJaganMarkGovernance#APFightsCorona #APInSafeHands

1478612565169213440	The news no one wants to hear to start the New Year…I’m double vaccinated,but tested positive for COVID today. 😔💔 I have sinus congestion and a cough with phlegm. (Sorry TMI) No other symptoms. Isolating. Stay healthy everyone!! https://t.co/gtaKEa1xdK
1481161057007775751	@susannareid100 This happened to me Susanna, I never got to say goodbye to my mum, and hold her hand as she passed. She in hospital, alone of covid. This will haunt me for ever. The pain of her loss is brutal! Boris needs to apologise and go!
1487942865217064964	@__runningmumma @UKRunChat I tested positive for Covid November 13. I had a bad cough, night sweats, fever, and I was very lethargic. I took a lot of naps. I did continue running a bit through the whole sickness. Minimum of 1 mile after which I did a lot of coughing but I think it cleared my lungs.
1484897790643912707	@BBCPoIitics I'm in isolation right now. I've worked at a large workplace during all the pandemic, with regular testing for over a year. Hundreds of colleagues have had covid.I've never had a positive test until last week. Maybe this is because Omicron is more infectious. /1
1531086813997289472	@QTWIQ1 @GrippyToes One of the effects of being hospitalized with covid is rapid ageing, unfortunately. I’ve seen it on a few people already, they look 10-15 years older. Hopefully it can be reversed somewhat with good diet and exercise.
1373853861849534466	In the first part of the pandemic, I always worried I had COVID. Lately I feel physically OK, but I’ve diagnosed myself with 2 new personality disorders and 1 OCD-adjacent issue that’s not yet in the DSM. Thanks, The Internet!👍
1417442415343030272	@CFCGARYG You can still catch it and still pass it on even being double jabbed. 60% of people in hospital with covid have been double jabbed. Imo i don’t see the point in me having it.
1454227395402207242	I need confirmation because maybe I missed it. Question: if someone you live with tested positive for Covid19; you get tested 1 week later; it comes back negative. Do you have to quarantine still?
1387403953453867013	Booked my first haircut since September, which I had just before I tested positive for COVID. Hopefully none of this is an omen.
1428112162816499713	@BottomleyFiona @NeilDance @StarkeyMichelle And I just told you your figures are wrong! I can assure you deaths caused by other illnesses or even suicides ARE still being classed as Covid deaths if the person tested positive to Coronavirus’s within 28 days of death… and with the testing producing 85% false +’s what 💩 !!
1512368583048790018	Idiot idiot idiot! After 2 years of hearing these stupid ass ignorant comments I’m just over it. Do you know how vaccines work? You can still get COVID. The vaccine will make sure you don’t end up in the hospital or worse
1376979184606658560	@SavedChances And the COVID test is fake. When I had Corona and gave it to my husband, he was clearly sick and contagious yet tested negative twice. Asymptomatic people are getting positive tests and being prevented from flying.
1375208553204572169	@kirstiealley Today I found out I have covid I went to the hospital because I was feeling so bad I can tell you this it totally sucks 😞
1422236733014302720	@CartoonsBen She’s a peach…She went after the Covington Catholic boys and tweeted THIS when President Trump was in the hospital with Covid…I pray she gets right with God 🙏🏻
1418612197601816585	"""I don't want the government to shove the vaccine down my throat"" says a man recently intubated in the ICU after catching COVID"
1620102180597534721	@chefswammie @catturd2 I was listening to the lies from Biden, Fauchi and the CDC.  in the last 6 months everyone I know that has got covid got jabbed, and has had covid more than once. I had it over a year ago (got it from all the masked / jabbed in the hospital)  , got over it and never got it again. https://t.co/Knoa4OqSp4
1441599050298511362	"@NotaliaMateo I know a girl. She tested positive. But it was a flu. None of the ""covid"" symptoms just a flu."
1379785925446746116	@AndiNeglia The only person I know who was diagnosed with Covid said it was far less severe than the flu she’d had years ago. Symptoms were the same though.
1548771626082357248	I’ve Been Sick For Months But Never Tested Positive For COVID. Here’s What Doctors Tell Me. https://t.co/ffmsjOwq2f
1405249023053897730	someone I know who's had both vaccines has just been diagnosed with Covid. it sounds like it's the Delta variant. they wore a mask, and have been isolating since day 1 due to serious health conditions, has caught something that could kill them! the culprit didn't wear a mask 🤬
1582652005574508544	waking up at 3am with Covid that refuses to test positive in home tests, checking my stan Twitter, freaking out because the man said ‘y’all’ https://t.co/zSkZPKxOg3
1370854716599529472	@rhiannonford2 Incorrect. It's a vaccine so that if I get covid, it will keep me from getting so sick that I won't have to go to the hospital and take valuable bed space from someone else. I'm doing my part to help get our country over this virus.💉😷 What are you doing?
1546195358778363904	@rorycooper @girlscouts There’s a guy on the job site I’m working on that acquired Covid In Vegas.  He flew home, in masked, and is now in the hospital with it. Pretty sure most of the other passengers have it now.
1374266338022191104	1. Probably why cases were initially higher 2. To those who got tested who were positive thanks for keeping me safe3. Personal choice but if you get Covid don’t moan4. I comply because I’ve got some common sense5. I find antilockdown campaigners more vile than the government
1453041828752723977	Biden needs to be held accountable for this. There’s no way to end this pandemic without workplace covid protections. I see too many cases where bosses tell employees to continue working after exposure and even after a positive test!
1550895288507703296	@Andrewemcameron Ok. I am safe and well. We had some COVID patients in the hospital, but the virus doesn’t like me. 😉Next week I’m going back to school which is nice, I like school. Kid’s mad at me, that’s less nice.What about you and can I do anything to help with that social anxiety? ❤️
1454546932173459458	@CDCgov So the people who tested negative, or never tested at all, were in the hospital for some reason… Covid like symptoms, despite being “fully vaccinated“.Am I parroting this correctly?
1505628182757748741	@Kirsty98270370 That’s good . I’m just Unwell and tested positive for covid but I’m getting there 💜💜💜
1451183063816282119	@robertcp @corkeysghost1 @savschippy91 @PaulEmbery You can’t disagree with the method of recording that statistic. I could go into hospital, test positive, die during surgery and on record I’d of died from Covid. It’s ridiculous to include that as an official Covid death. I’m not denying Covid isn’t killing people.
1473372189663666185	I agree. I don't give a shit about fake cards. I endorse them and would print them if I could. This is all fake fear from a WOKE NFL. Covid is Bullshit. Not one NFL player hospitalized from Covid. It's the flu! Wake up!
1381599713221304323	@FLS_Rodrigues @EssexPR @allisonpearson I'm not likely to go to hospital, in fact I'm highly unlikely to go anywhere near a hospital if I catch Covid. Those that are have been vaccinated. do you not understand how a vaccine works? I've a 1 in 240 chance of being killed in my car within my lifetime. life isn't risk free
1387066048894152708	There are many MPs that believe restrictions should be lifted, but are scared to say.I would say that most in their heart of hearts, know current levels are ridiculous and out of sync with the threat of Covid.Our hospitals are almost empty of people that have tested positive.
1399307580481191936	@HSELive I received the Johnson vaccine on 28.05, if I do the covid test in 5 days it can turn out positive ????
1468498383799214082	@Moelikhyd @AthiNkala99 @JordieBoy71 @BrendenNel I have some free time. So let’s substantiate it for him. 1) With a vaccine you are between 96% (Pfizer - BioNTech) less likely to have severe COVID and end up in the hospital. https://t.co/0HcidsPaL2
1452917574614888453	Well, 7 days ago I tested positive for Covid. I'm virtually back to normal now, and - bar a couple of weird little effects - for me it's been mostly like a bad, energy-sucking cold. I'm double vaccinated so I've been lucky. Plenty of others I know have really suffered. Take care!
1436173209875910660	@1917baybee @CifJamestown @KellyB1270 @philipaklein I agree with you. Millions have been vaccinated and there are less hospitalizations. The majority of people currently hospitalized with COVID or one of the variants are unvaccinated. Yes, the vaccine doesn’t protect you from getting the illness, but lessens it’s affects.
1467964853780422673	can we manifest the covid test i have to take is positive so i can stay off work and continue working through the marvel movies please
1465614660611325957	@tim94802536 @KathyConWom I'm so against masks but n95 grade or above for hospitals I'm not against. They have been super spreaders of multiple virus for decades hospitals how many people pre covid did we know picked up bugs in hospital but again only masks with any actual effect
1474491376087834631	I didn’t get covid this whole pandemic and im double vaxxed who did I piss off to test positive on Christmas Eve with no symptoms 🙄
1426555893575991304	2 years ago today, sicker than I've ever been in my whole life. Was even in the er the day before, ( I swear it was covid back then, couldn't breathe, felt like I was dying) I was on my way to Vegas. My @Judi0314 picked us up and I was to sick to even go out that night. https://t.co/RI00FBYNyJ
1466087258965032961	@gigsandtours Hi. Me and my wife have tested positive for covid and cannot go to @libertines this Saturday in Liverpool. We wondered if you could swap them for another venue on the tour when we've finished isolating? Thanks Simon

1468609862779166724	one of my housemates hooked up with someone who had someone in their pod test positive for covid. we share a bathroom and i'm like.......how long after they used the bathroom should i wait to shower bc i'm trying to be very cautious
1389130544202530822	@Johnrashton47 Jenny Hartis told GPs at a parliament committee that they needed no PPE as they would never see Covid19 patients because they would go straight to hospital  . In my opinion unfit for duty.
1386105110837678080	@JMF0927 @DrTomFrieden Reason why I retweeted, debate. What I know is you can still get Covid but symptoms will not be severe. Main reason why we need to get vaccinated, so we don't end up in the ICU.
1519324589637124097	@fuckyouiquit Monday I went into work sick because I had called off a day already this month, and I knew I'd get written up. Told managers I felt awful- they made me work my shift. Next day went to urgent care and tested positive for covid.
1447682305472880642	It wasn't Covid that brought me to the hospital. JSYK
1604318151604256769	i didnt leave my house for a month cause ive been sick ... i finally leave to see my gf and while we hangout her bandmate texts saying she got covid. Gf tested positive today ... why does god hate me, im so bored and lonely and want to cry
1473689583644778497	COVID update! PCR test confirmed positive 🙃👌 Currently on day 3 of feeling like hot garbage and still salty about having to spend Christmas away from my family but I know it's the right thing to do!Gonna try and organise a Christmas v2.0 for when I'm better 😂
1382401127992414211	@realDoc_Strange @TheHershAZ My guess is he has heard some of the more conservative media outlets make the claim that doctors are lying about how many patients have died from Covid. They say most of the cases were people who actually died of something else but tested positive for Covid. No proof, though.
1473454936444874758	@kburcroff @DlSunyata @SalSports Over 70% of the people in the hospital with Covid are overweight. I’m pretty sure that’s not from having a healthy eating and exercise lifestyle https://t.co/Grpqn08ZAv
1489621601897250817	@ReverendJhon You post but you don't know why. This show you are more fool than I am. My government save me and my family life for covid. Vaccine prevents us from going to hospital or dying like Israel.
1291586518864343042	I modestly propose that all people who test COVID-positive, when in public, must wear a purple marker with the date of their positive test clearly described in yellow letters at least 2 inch high.Until we develop a vaccine.The health of the public is at stake.  #ksleg
1486937597381251072	"Tbh I just read about some idols who tested (+) for covid, in my heart I hope that none of my faves are affected by the virus. But once I refresh my tl, then baammm ""Viviz Umji is positive for Covid-19""I suddenly felt powerless. Praying for Umji and other idols' recovery too."

1375226816890335233	#WritingCommunity well my luck ran out. As careful as I have been, I have Covid. And no it's not like the flu. I was one of the lucky one and didn't have to be hospitalized.
1436631709869559808	@greta Yes Greta ,, my wife and I both had the J&amp;J one shot vaccine, few months later we both apparently got exposed to someone with Covid and we both got tested positive for Covid 19 .. we both quarantined but only had mild symptoms more as a bad head cold,, we thank God
1471089990558011401	@MeThomasDuffy It’s ten days from a positive test. I’ve never wished to get COVID before but hope that if I do, it’s soon.
1377669482383077381	@SpeakPermission @mtgreenee My apologies. I'll clarify. The news is not covering it well and the point I was making is Ms. Greene is exercising,  healthy and not obese so chances are COVID should not harm her. Perhaps more coverage and emphasis that obesity is a large factor of those hospitalized.
1476334028559208450	i have heart &amp; lung issues &amp; i’ve tested positive for covid….
1455347939187077125	@_RaiseTheBlack_ @tonibaloney619 @JustAManic2020 @PhishfanW @Kozmik_Pariah @TuckerCarlson @foxnation 49% of the covid patients that see my doctor are vaccinated. 5% had natural immunity. 46% were unvaxed.  .88% of unvaxed need hospitalization versus .22% vaxed. Libs believe there's over a 50% of being hospitalized in either scenario. In reality it's less than 1%. Just sayin.
1522263673535811591	@mielcarz @chopaganda Thanks. Yeah - I have the Paxlovid rebound apparently. Was negative (rapid &amp; PCR) days 6-11 post Covid exposure, and tested positive again today. Trying to figure out what my isolation needs to look like
1387143671716401159	@AP Vaxed and keeping my mask on. Next, we should charge the unvaxed for Covid tests and treatment if hospitalized after a certain date. #yestocovidpassports
1404166582721335296	@48statecrate @financialsanity @EzraKahan It's a treatment, not a vaccine. You can still get covid. You can still spread covid.  I know of more people who have had reactions to the vaccine that I have heard of people that have been hospitalized or died from covid
1379012778665639942	@BBCNews Just heard a so called eminent authority say that because of the unreliability of these test if you test negative still behave as though it’s positive! Am I living in a parallel universe or is this really the future? Put me in a padded cell! #COVID19
1485654486509137922	Heres the loot from 40k hards and 10k elites + some loot breakdown. In hindsight opening was too big and the fun part of opening caskets faded quickly. Also tested positive for Covid after the stream, but im doing well. More fun links in the comments https://t.co/607qv7izat
1362075066406690819	@GoonerBeReal I would say if someone dies that soon after having the vaccine in this case the vaccine probably did cause the death. Remember if you die within 28 days of a Covid positive test you'll be called a Coivd death regardless of what killed you. Surely this has to work the same
1476815007132229634	@Babusch89636815 @DrJBhattacharya What this tells me is that 297 people went to the hospital, got tested at the hospital and tested positive. A better question would be did they go to the hospital with covid symptoms or were they there for something else and tested positive? Did they get covid at the hospital?
1478877294500499458	Soooooooo, streaming might be on a pause at the moment. I’m going to get COVID tested tomorrow 😅 fingers crossed I’m not positive
1465388070153424907	@headi420 @Val86133027 @MLS_Dave Exactly how I am.  After fighting to survive for 31 days in hospital &amp; now 17 weeks long Covid.  I don’t see why anyone would not rather take chance with vaccines than to go through what I did &amp; am. Covid is hell.

1473012094811336705	@kaya_masters I feel that this dynamic plays out on a large scale and explains statistics (specifically with omicron) showing spikes in people showing up in ER’s with Covid when other data shows most reactions are mild.
1431674528179032074	@NavygirlLaura Anti-vaxxers hospitalized for COVID should be a lower priority than those who have been vaccinated. Don’t judge me on that. They’ve been warned but, you know, “freedom”. The only things they’re “pro” about are Trump, Fox News and asinine conspiracy theories. Screw ‘em all.
1459044402140106754	#COVID19 Sth interesting is going on with the fig.  As someone who witnessed both SARS and COVID19, I would say the biggest difference between the two is mortality rate and how the two viruses kill.  I remember the scary clips of SARS patients being sent to hospital, looking 1/n
1473004188837629960	@pulte Hi I need to pay off a hotel room I got last night because my roommate tested positive for COVID and has refused to self-isolate, please help me on Venmo at Bethany-Greenman ❤
1448650169918967808	Hey all.   It’s @hostwththemost just wanted to say that I’ve tested positive for covid. I am fully vaccinated and so far it’s not been bad. Congestion and loss of smell.  That said @jeffwatson25 will have tonight’s show and we will take it day by day after that.  See you soon
1435020437583507460	Not my classes bring remote this week. Not me finding out students tested positive COVID a week after schools opened back up. This is a mess. https://t.co/qyRIVswFIS
1477471897835032577	@CbMelbourne @LesStonehouse I think the test numbers will stay about the same at least on week days.there’s a ceiling on how many tests they can do so they are rationing tests to the people most likely to have covid. that’s why positive rate is going up so fast.
1598466691498901506	@gregkellyusa I know several people who developed blood clots and the same diagnosed condition. Sudden onset with no other medical condition. The finger points to the Covid vaccine, which is what they honestly believe.
1489242523281199105	@fredrich_m My girlfriend was scheduled. Drank the stuff. Then tested positive for COVID. She had to cancel. I thought it was hilarious, she was pissed for days. She’s well now!
1541464180666109952	An actual swiss hospital just justified doing near nothing to protect patients from covid because “we can’t have social life and hide from the virus”. Is this evidence-based medicine? I guess @ksaarau missed the new @doctorfmh memo calling for mask back in hospital. #WhatTheFux
1502141061812178946	@ofsevit Iirc it was pointed out early in the pandemic up over here that a reason deaths with covid looked high compared to ICU was that some of those dying with covid were to frail for intubation. I.e. usually frail from age.So: what age groups are dying with covid now?
1531640484208287744	@sunshine_toes @JuliaHadley15 @robertopaulos85 @StevenWilson777 @spursonfifa @Lindalo78638237 @CartlandDr1982 @InCytometry @sickofcranks @IvorMectin1 @BrentLeeTV @Mctoon27 I've never know anyone to lose their sense of smell for months after an illness before covid. Now I know of at least 10 people it happened to who all just coincidentally tested positive for covid.
1372612851907620866	@TheOnlyGuru Installed but an expected alert didn’t materialise when MIL and Husband tested positive for COVID in December. I don’t think a code was given to them so perhaps a breakdown in the process
1418708950183075840	So I decided to do a home test for #COVID19 just to have a baseline. I am negative. I am not going to worry as much now. I have been maskless in the hospital and local stores. I think the confusion is due to misinformation. You can buy these tests from Walgreens. https://t.co/MxVGPc0Bcc
1521285088490708992	@thezachloeffler How many PCRs? For several people I know who had symptomatic covid in the last few weeks it took 2+ PCRs to test positive.
1342265543240409090	I tested positive for COVID today So have my beliefs changed?Nope.No vaccine for me, protect yourself how YOU see fit  I STILL believe in freedom &amp; liberty. Fear Does Not control me.Don't fear death. Fear God, &amp; nothing else.
1434817770202537986	True story. 2 weeks ago I went to emergency room. Got right in. Thought I was having a heart attack. It wasn't. I was totally dehydrated and malnourished. 2 days in ICUand 3 days of heart tests. Gave me a Covid test. Negative. No log jam at my hospital. Now I'm fit as a fiddle.
1424753100959649796	We get a week of PTO if we test positive for COVID. BUT I just cannot eat no more $1000 copays chile
1384483527350267905	Weird how the only place I saw deaths from covid was the newsI know 2 people who were really sick, 1 hospitalized for dehydration and released same day. I know more than I can count who have “never been sicker” or cannot even exercise weeks after the 💉 #scam
1427717406311469056	The ultimate question now is... What is the most fabulous way I can display my positive covid test.
1419724948160008202	@CarbonMonoxid17 @kutz_cole @GovRonDeSantis I'm not going to die in a hospital or give COVID to kids, they literally separate patients in the hospital soo that doesn't make sense
1512541773867925504	@1872RCK Me never, I’m a good woman. PCR test isolating, day hospital Tuesday for an injection into my hip bone. Do it in theatre so can’t have covid. Probably full of covid in the hospital too 🤣
1510679301967941632	@pmagn @TorranceCoste My question is, if it is known that one can still test positive weeks after first infection, how do we know if it is truly a second infection or symptoms of Long Covid? Unless both tests have identified different variants?
1473140854932049927	@PreetBharara I'm recovering from Covid. Not such a mild case, but not hospitalized. Vaxxed but not boosted. Had the antibody treatment which really helped. Now just waiting for my lungs to recover. Unfortunately my doctor said that could be months. But not hospitialized!! Get boosted!!!!!
1606091071171096577	@JamesLynchGTC @DrAseemMalhotra OK, fair enough. But it’s outdated. That’s my point. The overwhelming majority of the hospitalized with Covid are the vaxxed.
1480041255304192002	@nhendren82 @EricTopol @BrendanNyhan I heard some dr saying most come due to CoVid but not much needing oxygen. Made me question about the “with” CoVid and also wonder what symptoms are sending them to hospital then? Kind of confusing right now.
1386683806611017728	@PJW6466 I understand it very well . . . I can see your confusion. The stats record people of all causes, including Covid, within 28 days of a positive test. How does that suggest deaths from Covid rather than with Covid were excluded? It doesn't.
1356069284170977281	Elon Musk said he tested four times and it came back negative and positive in the same day I won’t get the corona china virus vaccine, 😎https://t.co/Q8EA2Ho6bp https://t.co/rURTrIgC1j
1422290539601448963	@joncoopertweets The world is about to explode. I have to thank…. @LindseyGrahamSC ??? Said he tested positive for COVID but says symptoms are minor thanks to the vaccine…. https://t.co/awG3yR6MPp
1403283266887618562	Pleased to announce that after attending my first social gathering in about a year or so I had a nightmare that I was diagnosed with covid, so that's how that's going
1522534465242771457	no but like why am I awake and feel like i am dying ☹️ about to get tested for COVID cus i might be positive 😭
1383907317238812676	@UKCovid19Stats I wonder how many of those 10 actually died due to covid rather than died with covid (or w/out covid if their test was a false positive).
1529130554137923586	#COVID19 update: I tested positive this morning. Working on getting meds 🤞🏼 #Paxlovid has been great for partner, sore af throat (checks out w the #achalasia) but getting better each day. Prayers, vibes, etc welcome as I’m also #HighRisk w a #RareDisease #vasculitis #PACNS
1459298854130663433	@RubinReport Bravo Sierra! Reports indicate that people contracting Covid who end up hospitalized are by far the unvaccinated.And regret it they do. Trust me.Regrets getting it.? A lot? Again you're full of shaite!
1385596755501273090	@NorthWestCop My little lady was taken very ill at the start of this pandemic, the only kindness shown to her was a notice that @metpoliceuk were trying to terminate her employment, as she was still in her probationary period!Eventually diagnosed with Covid.No wellbeing support shown!
1464456983545892877	@paulaptlb @kylegriffin1 But when I have the vax can’t I still spread covid?And the vax is 95% effective, which means of which 5% you will have symptoms and of that 5% you have a 80% chance to bot be severely sick. And also 98% of people in hospital are not vaxxed elderly. So whats your point?
1485519772926238722	@mattletiss7 I'm guessing you have not been affected by Covid one bit Matt. There were still many who did die as a direct result of getting covid. Many who were really ill in hospital. Many who missed time off work. Many who lost their jobsJust shows you are selfish and care not for others
1477095335650603011	Am I the only person that didn’t upload a pic of a positive test/result when I got COVID? Feel left out 🤣
1601527520058544128	Is anyone who has been diagnosed with MCAS post #Covid able to message me please? I have a few qs regarding this and now suspecting my dizzyness and gastro is all linked. It was also mentioned I am hyper mobile at a gasto app so suspected EDS
1377889305260007424	Recently, my manager pressured me to come in to work when I had a fever and severe shortness of breath, since I’d tested negative for covid so clearly I must have been okay. I quit instead. Two weeks later I went to the er because I wasn’t getting enough O2.
1424601326890192897	@glenda546 @RyanProng @jopsych @conservmillen Considering I personally know two vaccinated people that got sick from Covid about a month ago (1 hospitalized) and spread the virus to loved ones, I'm going with - you're wrong
1407923699580387329	Diagnosed COVID without a CXR or seeing the patient. My new superpower is COVID spidey sense. Fever and lymphopenia? Yup…it’s COVID. Spoiler alert: the CXR showed pneumonia. https://t.co/M9oFpH4sdy
1601587463939837952	@kelsieswrites @ChrisSnowCGY I had Covid, here in the UK,  in August and was admitted to hospital as an emergency as I developed pnemonia.  I can only say I know how scared you must feel and that I will be praying for Chris, for sure, that he will turn the corner and come through this.

1379402166054440970	I'm in a French class with a nurse who is a covid denier. How do you who are in the medical profession deal with that! I can't imagine being a nurse or doc having to work with someone who denied the reality in the hospital! Too much on top.of the stress of Covid!
1379682630770245632	#TitsAnd Morning you sexy lot. What a lovely day it is in Kent.I’m off to the hospital today for a COVID test, if I can getting away with a #TitsAnd covid test I will haha https://t.co/ZK5qjYQ4CG
1352508029120339970	@MikeTheBard It was my third test since COVID started though. And I was shocked I tested positive this time though, as my only major symptom was congestion (I had some GI cramping that I had assumed was side effect from the vaccine).
1450530188505362432	@marysweeney0 @SteveRudland @glenninluton @Beany_1 Yes I agree long term COVID is an issue. Which these supposed daily deaths take away from. I want to know what percentage of people in hospital and ICU are unvaccinated and what is the age and underlying health condition of the.
1482209612635852810	@GreyHighlands @ladymidnightxxx EVERY winter, beds are a precious commodity due to the flu season. Every winter.Add lack of staff due the unjust firing of unvaxxed &amp; sick vaxxed staff, hospitals will have bed shortages. I find it very hard to believe every bed in the hospital is occupied by a unvaxxed Covid pt.
1513223228432465924	@robotronica @C2theNett @Ariodante79 @freedumfghtr @newmarketbarber Every fully vaxxed person I know has contracted Covid. One of them contracted Covid in hospital &amp; died. The true virologists plainly stated their concerns that the mass vaccination would create new variants. They believed that ONLY the vulnerable should have been vaccinated.
1490363673810018304	@nathaliejacoby1 I’m triple vaxed was told I was overdue for next booster but was told by Walgreens they don’t do two boosters. Got Covid 8 days ago. Fever, body aches, cough, would prob be in hospital without the vaccines and booster. Prob would not be as sick had I been allowed to get 4th shot.
1388959368419414019	@MattFinkes Funny thing is I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer while in the hospital for COVID19! I am having surgery tomorrow morning!
1468036795560517643	My youngest lad in primary school testest positive for Covid last week.3 days later my eldest in secondary tested positive.The youngest by coincidence was literally nowhere apart from school and home in the week leading up to infection so we are 99% sure where he picked it up.
1503122000004399105	I'm not vaccinated and had a cold when I tested positive for Covid....So the vaccination helped how?
1505325062294937603	Fun fact i was in the hospital literally a day before all the covid shit happened
1380335706225180672	@BTScoldshower I know the feeling I tested positive for covid 19 back in December its no joke at all my symptoms were bad but I got through it and I hope u make it through get lost of rest drink water or tae and take it easy https://t.co/pjZ4qkxwEj
1579505750539632641	Me and husband tested positive for Covid and are feeling sick. It is very likely we caught it in the Boston concert on Thursday. People who went and are not feeling great should get tested, there may have been an outbreak.
1449049201955024904	@Andy666666 @carolineplayle I was the same. I worked in hospitals throughout both waves of Covid and was in very close proximity to people who had tested positive but have never had it (to my knowledge). That was before we had vaccines although I’m vaccinated now.🙂
1476699174355841029	@hughosmond @sajidjavid @hughosmond ive thought exactly the same thing, if staff have tested positive but OK to work just use them in the in theory isolated covid wards, would make total sense.
1368721638171156481	@demonxbae When receiving the COVID vaccine, the shot itself is a small dose of COVID so that the immune system can recognize it and fight it off. Most people test positive after getting the vaccine. I’m sorry you’re dealing with this!
1425137259058278401	Was watching tv, someone was drowning &amp; had that awful watery death rattle. Had the most almighty flashback of when I sounded like that and of when those around me in hospital sounded like that before they died. One hell of a panic attack. Covid is NOT a nice way to go. #COVID19
1471976403734204420	@babesingoyland @NSWHealth 100% correct. I have no desire to be back in ICU red zone looking after covid deniers and antivax loons refusing treatment (like some of them did) and watching them pass away in a horrific way. Begging to be intubated and vaccinated. #Domicron
1397796855266873346	@jessphillips @MattHancock @BorisJohnson My grandad. Didn't die of covid. But due to dementia had to go into a care home. He was moved from home to home &amp; had long periods in hospital while they figured out where to place him. We couldn't visit him. The last months of his life he spent confused &amp; alone. https://t.co/BcOiQL7JEZ
1371854596298178563	For those concerned about the covid-19 vaccine: I was sleeping next to a covid-positive person for two weeks straight and tested negative two times. I received the vaccine and it works! #science
1470777980846850054	Within the last week, we've had each one of our three children be in close contact with a covid positive case in each of their classrooms. Two of the three have tested negative so far. Waiting until the proper time has passed to get the third tested. I'm fucking tired, y'all.
1448014335784149004	@DanielLeader10 I’m a respiratory therapist on the front line and I don’t understand how nurses can refuse the vaccine due to everything they have seen with Covid patients. At my hospital there is a nurse who works in the ICU and big trump supporter, he got the vaccine
1541161125638717445	@MysteryGrove I told my family that if I was hospitalized with COVID that under no circumstances were they to allow anyone to intubate me.

1543142843472089090	My wife had a follow up 7 days after she tested positive for Covid. At the appoint she asked if they could use another rapid to retest her to see if she could stop quarantining in the home and to save having to go into the store for a rapid test if positive. Idk what to think as
1377624568060317697	QUICK: how can I refuse a COVID test in the hospital????
1377733140760920066	@BajaBlast444 @ElijahSchaffer Covid isn’t a hoax. My kid is in isolation (really not that off from normal for a 14 year old except it’s not self initiated this time) because two teachers tested positive. He was exposed one day but it’s enough.
1432650426055282697	@DeadsyCOD @TenaciousWarden @borgridk @GameSpot Exactly this. I work in a hospital, my Educators are questioning the efficacy of these vaccines, especially since the flu has been around for over 100 years are still has more deaths than when COVID came out. They wont test for the Flu, youll get tested for C19 until positive
1480676491494973440	@barriecassidy I really hope journalists continue to press for an answer on his movements after his Dec 16th positive test. Exposing others to COVID deliberately is really quite unforgivable.

Since 100s of thousand have died in the hospital, has the NIH or CDC recommended changing the guidelines? (PS, my husband was healthy, didn’t have Covid.)

1373568141809360899	@LozzaFox I really want to be there when you’re diagnosed, but refuse any treatment for Covid. When you selflessly give up your NHS bed or ventilator. Because “you’d rather die” than wear a facemask when you pop to Waitrose. You fucking knob.

1351415915934527489	I know someone will say not to politicize a death, but my FIL died from Covid. He was in the right group to get a vaccine this week. It was already too late. And he deserved better. He had a loving wife, kids, grandkids, and he was alone in the hospital instead of with family.
1370089106429112327	One year ago today, I was battling COVID-19. I was one of the first to test positive in Georgia and likely the first in my company. So grateful I fully recovered, able to work from home, (still have a job) and for a vaccine I can’t wait to put in my arm.

1407321044805898243	@cmo0ns @alex_carter93 I understand that but if you don’t test with some positive people in the group you aren’t getting any decent results. You need to be testing to see how it spread with say a “patient zero” who has covid to see how that spreads through 10000 people.

1428527625979498503	@PedroRDiaz @wsvn You could get struck by lightning too. But since 95-99% of hospitalized COVID cases are the unvaccinated - I’d say it’s favorable odds if your vaccinated.  Hey, role the dice. It’s your life. But in the long run the gambler rarely wins. Good luck.

1439698471494332417	@NotATweeter16 @chrisrock @RexChapman Where’s the logic in that when vaxxed people are also going to the hospital? My family are not vaxxed, all got covid, and non were hospitalized. 🤷🏼‍♀️
1417218811837632519	@chrostophmarkos @PN_1984 I don't think that the ct swab values were lessened but they don't sequence sample if detected after 28 cycles.  They don't count covid cases if case is not hospitalized with symptoms or died from covid. We should demand they use that same system for everyone not just vaxxed.

Are there random sample tests that distinguish between vaccinated,  prior infection, or neither?  With dates of events?
1378049582483968004	When Joe Biden was inaugurated, the CDC came out almost immediately and said testing cycles were too high.. Higher cycles= virtually anything can test positive for corona virus. With states opening up, I would not be surprised if they called for a “new” testing formate 👀👀

1483580193184882692	@captainwonkish yes, I had a visit at day 8 IIRC. When I asked, they said they wanted everyone with Covid to come in as long as they'd tested positive in the last 14 days. Perhaps it's different by centre? I'm in Edinburgh.
1457626294859014148	@doctor_oxford But Covid cases are down so who’s in the hospital? Are they patients who have been not treated for 18months? I heard that there’s stroke and heart attack victims, stating vaccine reactions..is this true?

1477751343536242691	Before this wave I didn’t know anyone who had caught covid. In the past 2 days 8 people have tested positive. #omicron is an absolute beast. Stay safe out there, and try and limit interactions where you can. #yeg
1480183668756946949	@katnkevin2001 @catturd2 Guess what I'm unvaccinated I had covid and I didn't need to go to a hospital, but there's people right now in the hospital that were vaccinated and have covid 💁🏻‍♀️ I will trust my own immune system.
1403405568774131722	Not a SINGLE person in ICU in Northern Ireland 'with' covid. ZERO. But mark my words, we won't be opening up this year, because it isn't about a virus is it? The 'Delta Variant' means we're in too much danger!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Then the Mexican, then.... Climate change 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/0HSwo6aEMQ

1468248701441298460	A few months ago, someone was complaining TO ME about how mask mandates are stupid. His has a low blood cell count so he’s immunocompromised. The very next day, he tested positive for Covid and had to be hospitalized. :)
1477438173798191104	This girl tested positive for Covid last week. And she was out for NYE. I asked her abt it she said she got a negative test. In less than 8 days? Somebody lying
1467289176940834820	@Nurse0013 @RealDyl32 @marat_frida @taytay5576 @alpsa @TheAviator1992 That's not how our health system works. Unfortunately if it's overloaded, likelihood of survival takes precedent. Our aged care has already been told the residents with covid will not be taken to hospital, which I think endangers everyone.
1406396254628810753	@aprilsclassics $halfofmysoul - hello! I would be so grateful 😭 I was an essential worker, a substance abuse counselor, but I tested positive for covid. While I was recovering, my position was eliminated and it’s been so hard finding work. Appreciate anything 💝

1507345261529468928	When I was diagnosed earlier for covid I couldn’t sleep for 2 days cos I was coughing badly at night, played and recited some doas and all
1597032231452561409	I’ve tested positive for Covid for the first time ever and holy fuck was it a rough morning
1426774576504008708	@demodilettante @lelia_glass @ajlamesa I did. She feels betrayed because despite sky high vaccination rates in SF, incredibly low covid death rates, no children hospitalized from covid in the entire city, SF continues to lurch towards more draconian mandates. It’s circular, never-ending logic.
1380268875850207232	@LasVegasLocally The number of cases of people that have received the vaccine and have now tested positive for COVID is growing in Clark County. You can still get and transmit COVID after the vaccine so I guess everyone should be tested every week. The Wynn is just playing games.
1506577749871366146	@IsabelOakeshott 200 people died yesterday in England with covid…the new easier to spread version. I wonder if it’s because Boris said the pandemic is over that so many people are infected, in hospital, in ICU and dying? It’s really bad in Scotland too…it’s definitely not away.
1474082577820504064	The fact I have to pay for a covid test in Alberta when I was in contact with a positive case whether it was less than 15 minutes or not is unreal…
1417483812007780355	No word of a lie, I know around 25 people who’ve tested positive for Covid in the last 2 weeks.
1538944290201673728	@NototyrannyNOW @NicoleTenev Never had a single phucking symptom only knew because work made me get tested after family members were positive in 2020 haven’t had it since and been directly exposed 10x’s since. 🖕🏻Covid
1467553999540862983	I wasn’t allowed to travel to the hospital or stay with my Spouse when they had an emergency in June, directly because of Covid precautions enacted by the EMTs and hospital. I had to spend a week alone in our apartment with no transport or company, panicking about how Spouse was
1418021912190410756	Jesus Christ. Look at the ducking statistics. When you get the Covid you won’t get insanely sick or die. All of those getting hospitalized are the ones who have not been vaccinated 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️I swear people just spew shit out of their ass without doing their research.
1454914061028757510	"Nothing quite beats the awkwardness of chatting to neighbours at the door on Halloween only for your mum to shout ""Issy you've tested positive for covid!"" In the middle of the conversation.I've never heard a silence so loud in my life."
1449378691730055172	Didn't get to see @simpleplan this month...and I tested positive for covid. I hate it here.
1479726849471221761	@CConceptCreator @ZONEofTECH As a test,  Lateral flow is less accurate than pcr. Then you have to factor in human error too.  I knew somebody who was covid positive (multiple PCRs) who did LFD every day and NEVER got a positive result.
1432664044591218698	Locked eyes with about 5 people while I spat in my cup getting my covid test...hope they're all doing alright. I'm not. Test: negative. Feelings: Positive.
1561488409109069824	well my mama just tested positive for covid 😀
1482559398283288578	@RonFilipkowski This is 100% true, a teacher i work with was in the hospital with covid and they literally pulled her treatment plugs out of her to use on an african american patient who was priority above whites. I have absolutely nothing against blacks i dated one for a while but this is wrong
1507815748227694596	@saltyreigns That is the narrative as covid is a notifable disease so the dead are tested to determine cause of death. Positive test therefore death with covid even if it was delivered by a piece of lead. Everyone I have discussed this issue with agreed that it is duplicitous to assert this
1479338509483667456	Sounds like sensible advice; and a good heads up for planning purposes. “I've tested positive to COVID. What should I do now?”#covid19vic https://t.co/y18uQp08qS
1380684226496970756	Detroit-area hospital is out of ventilators tonight for Covid patients, a source tells me. Michigan has almost as many people hospitalized now as the peak last April. It's very bad.
1476671242514022422	@k_y_l_e_____ I realize I asked both “am I the asshole” and “is this reasonable” so I’ll take your reply as an answer to the latter 😂I doubt covid would send me to the hospital, but you make a good point, as I did end up there with angioedema after I recovered LY. Thank you immune system 🙄
1552356823847428096	@Bel_B30 I was one of those ‘poor buggers.’ Diagnosed with cancer during Covid. I did seek help and experienced a delayed diagnosis due to restricted medical services. Anyone who calls me ‘selfish’ can go to Hell.
1376577032147017739	@MelodyWalls15 @Bluebir04789230 @laurenboebert I’ve been tested weekly and completed my vaccine in early February. Not one positive Covid result. So you can put that nonsense to bed now.
1376237784432848896	@VP Ma’am covid is still classified as a pandemic and it’s so bad my family is afraid to put me in the hospital and I’ve been having seizures for a month. Ain’t no relief. Also, I’m still drowning in student loans 🥰
1410887808437342208	@SandraWeeden Same article states 24 people in hospital with ‘confirmed’ Covid in Wales. 24. Which is ‘down 1’. I mean, really? Aren’t they worried that even the sheepiest sheep might start noticing that the statistics don’t back up the propaganda?
1469763286119890949	@DrJenGunter Can you request to be seconded there for specific responsibilities, i.e. caring for pregnant women with covid in ICU, for the amount of time you could dedicate away from your regular charge?
1518743215536590848	@CarlosSimancas I refused it when I was hospitalized for what they claimed was COVID. The doctor said he was REQUIRED to offer it.
1427298406444281857	so i tested positive for covid and have been down in the dumps recently. could really use a win. if someone wants to retweet and tell me i have nice hair that would be dope.
1384728853789036547	@caligostoloboto MAYBE if i test positive for covid then for a bit i will but otherwise juggling my job + comms would be too difficult
1487831200437706752	So how long am I going to test positive for covid?
1525790266686427136	i have tested positive for covid, i cannot feel worse, everything hurts, fatigue, muscle pain, sore throat, cough, i cannot feel worse
1455307320821489666	@NoMoreTrump14 @KristySwansonXO Yes. There is a high probability that many Vaccinated are in the hospital with Covid. That was my point.
1532246603515453440	@LibMarianne No, I was diagnosed with Covid and I am in home isolation.
1433970941617266695	@ItsBouquet This was a trend waaaay before Covid. It’s when it gets to ICU at home I’ll get a bit nerverated.
1433920344855773186	Give me a break, the PCR test is 50% false positive for Covid because it test positive for other viruses like the Flu ! Notice no media coverage for Flu deaths since Covid started ! Duh Hello ??

1514742509338996743	@LaTriSarahtops @alexmeshkin 100% Prior to Covid I was already having to avoid a lot &amp; take a ton of precautions as I'm immunocompromised with bonus crappy lungs. A cold can/has given me pneumonia, the flu could put me in the hospital.It'd be nice if people would enhance mitigating behaviors- but unlikely.
1483149236367675401	@BertB61027155 @sailorrooscout My 92 and 93 in-laws both got covid. Both vaccinated 2 weeks apart with Moderna. Got covid week before booster. One had sniffles for 2 days, the other immobile hospitalized and only needed oxygen for 2 days. Both had more than 1 comorbidity. Vaccines saved their lives.
1473786761750794241	@QuodGoogla You think people in ICU on ventilators for covid are leaving with a giant medical bill if they don’t have private health cover? That’s disingenuous.I didn’t say refuse, I said people would be denied healthcare, which is what happens when people can’t afford to pay for it.
1422214723223838725	@FormerlyAYeti Your welcome Keith....This whole Covid virus has been crazy it is all up to the individual person....I have seen the wife or husband test positive but the other spouse doesn't get Covid. People also have their reasons to vaccinate or not....everything is on a individual basis
1446848064593989632	@klm if my covid pcv test comes back positive before my flight, can I get a refund ? Thanks
1429047393807446018	omfg i keep having dreams where i test positive for covid fuck sake
1477023790303531015	@yourflannelcure Then I saw your earlier tweet where you stated that you tested positive for COVID for a third time and then I understood what this tweet really meant
1478759238604398598	"@settolove86 @jamesgraysport @novaxgirl do you know if hospitals really are ""overwhelmed""?I presume they might be no because nurses who aren't va X X ed can't work, and many more tested ""positive"" for Covid and can't work"
1416070892170350593	@JulianHillMP I bought a new bed and duvet covers etc last week. And I am now home isolating for 14 days after getting my tonsils out, just in case I picked anything up in hospital and I also can't afford to get covid whilst I'm recovering. My lovely bed is very much essential now.
1379639677167099908	9) Anyway I didn't have the fight in me to argue with this cardiologist convinced it can't possibly be my heart.So I'm back to square 1. Now that I've gotten my 1st covid vaccine dose &amp; get my 2nd dose in 2 weeks I'm just gonna suck it up &amp; go to ER next time I have chest pain.
1357684576089346048	@fordm My understanding from my campus colleague (nurse in our health center) is you may test positive for antibodies due to your immune response. You would not test positive for a COVID viral test  just from getting the vaccine.
1486856312151588871	@j_pagsy @jpm168 @JustinTrudeau I will and for the rest of you, I sure hope your country will wake up. Reason why hospital admissions is going up, it because everyone going to hospital is screened. Less than half of the admissions is due to Covid. Dont you think we done the math already?
1434500605993750534	Update, I got tested positive for Covid. I’m sorry to those who were waiting for folders, won’t be coming for a while now. I’m extremely weak and tired
1421129188589907972	@catherinerusse2 @toadmeister Im hearing lots of double vaccinated are in hospital with covid some nurses on here posting that ICU is full of vaxed people How does anyone ever prove they would have been more ill without the jab ?
1381465857432375296	@stickermule I tested positive for Covid yesterday morning, so not great
1388051124591243269	I'm interested to know how many of the people in hospital with Covid  were admitted because of Covid symptoms and how many caught it while there? #COVID19
1463889042513276928	@stalkbroker0720 @surerightnever @snappertone @Gillette13Jim @tito_ggg @Cernovich Considering the death rate didnt go up at all id say America's death count was right on par with what it has been in past years. COVID 19 deaths are highly over counted anyways. They count those WITH positive test in last 2 weeks as COVID deaths. I wanna know how many died OF C19
1402709146856796171	@CliveRoper @beverleyturner @BBCNews how many died (with a positive test  and not necessarily of covid) 6! and how many hospital beds in this country - if i remember rightly the 1k covid number is about 0.8% of the beds available
1373094450365358080	@AdamBarnello @aetiology Same. My almost 1 year old’s class was all sent home today at 10 am because his classmate tested positive for COVID. I had him tested today so we’ll see.
1420284085788893185	I think I may have caught the covid virus from my sibling, he’s been tested positive and I have some of symptoms as well. not sure if it’s another symptom but I’m also feeling super exhausted all of yesterday and today.it could be a simple cold tho, we’ll have to wait and see..
1501711721286619139	I want to do the right thing here, but @AmericanAir just charged me an additional $476 to rebook my flight because my partner tested positive for COVID. Making it really hard to keep others safe when you're financially clobbered for it...
1374040062229409792	@constantvigils Hi lovely I know it must be super worrying and idk if it will reassure you but I’ve been in the hospital 4 times during covid and they’re super careful about bringing it onto non covid wards
1578207046738276353	Well, y'all, it's finally happened. It took me 2 years, but today is the day I have tested positive for the coronavirus. I did not think this day would come, but now it has. Ever since I heard the results were positive, it made my day feel like crap.

1438268305144430595	@S_Foreman @LaSass3 @joncoopertweets I would just like to see them man up as if they have a pair. Dont get vaxxed, fine by me. But don’t run to the hospital when covid strikes. Ride it out at home.

1374111488546377737	At very least, those that had contact with covid positive athlete should be tested  and if mask wasn’t worn could have exposed those that were not just close contact. Wearing mask should be stressed but I doubt that will happen

1373255655344254987	@Gary_J_G @sheffieldlamby The symptoms of COVID, except for the fever and loss of smell and taste, match my everyday existence so I’ve just gone about my days as if I was infected and avoided people and wore my mask. I never tested positive for COVID.
1532045737751523328	@K8J444 I just tested positive for COVID on Saturday. I am unvaxxed. I DO NOT regret my decision to remain unvaxxed, in the least. I've had strep throat infections worse than what I'm feeling right now. I knew it was a matter of time that I'd be infected, but I'm just fine!
1374380311899869184	@america_marilyn @GwenDudrow @barnone07441639 @kayleighmcenany @FoxNews @AmericaRpts @SandraSmithFox @johnrobertsFox We have few flu cases because they aren't TESTING for flu. Yes trust science- what % difference do masks make? 2? Let's not be ridiculous. Flu cases were called COVID. I know this for 100% certainty because I 'tested positive for COVID', when I actually just had the flu. ONLY me?
1376996196485451782	@AudioMouseMusic I was vaccine hesitant but I looked at it this way; either I got the vaccine or I ended up with covid (and it WILL kill me...I end up in the hospital every time I catch a damn cold bc it goes right to my lungs). Vaccine 1 is done with zero problems. Celebrating after vax 2.

1436393638699884551	@AllanAgard @oXxRowanxXo I've been wanting to get Covid vaccinated - my doctor won't let me, because of the 23 required childhood vaccinations 18 of them hospitalized me and I nearly died from anaphylactic allergic reaction -my doctor says the base used in the covid vaccine is the same I'm allergic to :(
1438290872261611520	@jakethewakerobr @Cernovich Yeah, I'm not the OP making the racist point. Y'all trying to make it about race. Just don't go to the hospital asking for medical treatment from the same doctors and pharma whom you don't trust to prevent the vaccine. Over 90% unvaxxed covid in hospitals
1430325223430053889	I absolutely despise the ABC and the rest of the Aussie MSM for their deaths in hospitals reporting.People are passing away in hospital from a myriad of illnesses but, may be showing CV-19 symptoms, so it’s a “Covid related death”.Think of their families feelings, you shitheads
1455357174369210370	@Tanfox13 I’ll take the 1% chance of dying from Covid over the 1% chance of a vax reaction any day. I tested positive with zero symptoms. Why would I get a vax now. It’s systematic oppression of the unvaccinated. This is a political power crisis, not a epidemic crisis.
1359147544459153410	I interact with people that’s tested positive for COVID-19 on the daily and I’ve yet to go get my vaccine. Honestly I really be too tired after working 15 hours.

1328614256737193985	@adamgordon1978 @GeriSoc @CQCProf @vicrayner @CareEngland Totally agree - I think Covid+ patients should stay in hospital for the 10/7 OR be discharged to a separate CQC Designated Setting. And NOT into a care home where the other residents are now placed at risk! Crucial while we wait for the vaccine.
1385208146960994308	Thank you @GovTimWalz for the workplace mask mandate. My small office w/ few employees &amp; minimal traffic seemed low-risk but we’ve followed your mask guidelines anyway.

I would consider at home with a flu like illness as 'fine'. And no GPs are screaming that they are 'overwhelmed' with covid patients seeking supervisory care
1537750724326477826	@CKeeves I just want to remind people who are feeling like there was no point to wearing a mask (because they got Covid anyway), that the exposure affects how sick you'll become. An instant of exposure may get you sick, but maybe not hospitalized. Every percent of mitigation matters.

1537061791028629504	@hubick Well it seems that Paxlovid is only helpful for those that have serious comorbidities that will land them in hospital. Even though our politicians have said that this will be one of our saving graces, I think it is wishful thinking for the bulk of the population that gets COVID.
1378872295981260803	"@timatimfitfitb @MZHemingway @MLB @NBA @NASCAR @NFL @NHL I know/deal directly with doctors &amp; admin who have shared the expectations/""rules"" concerning applying Covid to hospital visits, treatment, &amp; deaths. Many are disgusted. Many are taking advantage of the system."
1373398033791033346	@davidmweissman Sadly, this was not a good week. Started out with 6 hours in ER with an Anaphylactic reaction that nearly killed me and ended with shots in my knees yesterday that left me limping and light-headed. But I get my 2nd Covid shot next Thursday, so life is good!
1430120791774015490	@Greytaitai @Known__Unknowns @Cernovich From where I live I know thousands of people. In 20 months 6 got covid with very minor symptoms. 15 people I know who had gotten the vaccine have been rushed to hospital, booked emergency appointments with their doctor because of on going chest pains. I dunno I’m not pro or anti
1379158474693640193	Back in the ER. I wonder which of the following versions of Covid my wife is suffering from:UKSouth African ChineseDouble Mutant Japanese
1382245074285821953	@ChirpsByJames See doctor. My wife does the same and she was diagnosed with long COVID.
1556583873202384896	Speaking of Covid…Last rapid test had the faintest of Positive lines. Still visible, so I’m still in quarantine, but I’m feeling mostly better.Now I just need to dodge the opportunistic infections trying to take advantage of my weakened immune system.
1413763358327779328	@antallen1 @RummazKnowsBest You have to take in consideration the basis of how those deaths are recorded though. Say I'm double vaccinated, catch covid today and confirmed via a positive test...I then die from a stray coconut falling out the sky and smashing my skull open. Guess what it gets recorded as.
1431040382297645059	@goodguysch @Rachel__Bush I know…I had all kinds of issues from the shots (very common) But, Side effects from the first shot will not give a positive Covid test result so no, I never considered that.
1476545505152933894	@chipfranklin I think your right and I am not alone.  After watching all the death all the pleading with new non vaxers, hibernating, vaxed 3 times, I think their getting the message, they don’t like. Their are on their own.  Vaxed ppl  get a cold from covid they get hospitalized.
1516466144449814540	URGENT PANDI ALERT coming in hot from the province… 30 hours after that same province emailed to let me know about my positive test. Feels like the ⁦@TimHoustonNS⁩ “don’t mask, don’t tell” approach at work. #covid #nspoli https://t.co/3vjMxqrnBk
1479788507774472195	My pulmonologist and I have been waiting for my pcr result since yesterday. I hope they can release it tomorrow so she can adjust my medication or if I should already go to the hospital. I also need the pcr test result so I can be admitted properly (covid ward / non-covid ward).
1375702859518341127	@Gianna_DiorXXX I've tested negative for covid but positive for horny
1469318007751127046	@feckitdotcom @celticmoonqueen @Mariabambi2 @docrussjackson That's very common because there were so many covid patients everyone got infected even if they came with other issue. My patients came with gastro issues but Covid was what killed them...because they tested unfortunately positive before they got taken away by Covid. Unvaccinated
1485797665384243200	@txsalth2o Me! I’m vaccinated and boosted. Never had Covid. I’m tested weekly because of my job… where I’ve been surrounded by positive cases! I have worked through the entire pandemic and have gone on vacation 4 times. The vaccine works. Period.
1374125252133982212	Found out that where I work over 50 ppl tested positive for COVID and do you think I was informed by a boss since I was with them all the day before they got tested ... absolutely not 🙄
1541541903795195907	I’ve evaded it but I recommend everyone who was at ac bury this weekend test for covid bc some people have tested positive since https://t.co/Pg77nE1baa
1475453173246668800	@Laiebchbum I tell you what let that person get a bad case of covid go to the icu in they roll that vent in there they will believe it then
1474002644549214211	My colleague is positive to covid 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂 I'll have to do a test after Christmas and i just panicked bc that reminded me of the hospital bc i did 2 before being admitted there. I dont want to do it, i dont want to find out i may have something bc of someone elses fault !!!
1481685158570958849	An upside of getting a positive Covid test today has been the chance to really crack on with this amazing book ready for the @TheGEAcademy 12 month course I start later this month. #WritingCommunity https://t.co/NYqlJBf8Vj
1405642769868021762	@Averyflash @catkins989 @CMOH_NL I agree it is sad that I am unable to be proud of much of the PH response here... Preventing the requirement for masks in hospital between Mar and Nov of 2020 was what disillusioned me initially Than the denial that kids spread COVID... and not permitting masks in school.
1379107557319532544	@udarnik I've had and recovered from covid getting monoclonal antibodies. I got the J &amp; J vaccine. I read that I have a 90% chance of not contracting covid again and a 100% chance of not being hospitalized. Are these numbers true?
1476800993845121027	"""I do think it's important to point out to the unvaccinated that they are holding us back. They are holding hospitals hostages. When you work in the hospital, it's the unvaccinated COVID pts taking up ICU/hospital beds."" https://t.co/h0bWFL4DIJ"
1385361795280429056	@MeidasTouch I just received the results of my COVID Antibody test.  Results are reported as either positive (meaning antibodies are detected in my blood) or negative (meaning no antibodies are detected).  After 6 months from my 2nd shot, I am happy to report that I tested POSITIVE!!!!
1415647075203788805	@Reality42551652 @BenDLieberman @EricTopol Refusing the test should be illegal. How ever I am also of the mind of you refuse to vaccinate you should be ineligible for doctor care for covid like symptoms.  They made thier bed they can die in it. At risk people who are hospitalized should not have to be near them.
1512559980389408770	@agargmd He already had Covid, didn't he? We saw news bytes said he'd tested positive &amp; was either asymptomatic or had such mild symptoms it never even slowed him down. And here's my take: If HE isn't scared, why should WE be? &amp; is it evil if I admit I'd rather Kamala as Pres. anyway?🤣🙏
1480563115271933953	The term breakthrough covid drives me crazy! No vaccine is 100%. Breakthrough makes it sound like the vaccine didn't do it's job. Yes, it did as you probably didn't end up in hospital &amp; die. If you get the flu shot &amp; then the flu, is that a breakthrough flu? #covid19
1481294975870676996	@BillEtheridgeuk Believing that his hospitalisation for Covid was not genuine is a step too far for me. Before the vaccines (and now the more benign Omicron) things were more serious. I know middle aged people who were normally strong ending up in hospital.
1412751473209905152	Me - “Tested positive for covid yeno” Mike- “was good knowin ye, I’ll make sure ye funeral goes out with a bang” He having a laugh? 😭😭
1431579355155599363	I won't hit Like  on this sad news. This is what I've been saying. Non vaccinated people getting Covid are putting a Strain on our Health care system. This is so sad. Get vaccinated!!!! I won't go to the Hospital even if I need Emergency help. I have heart issues.
1475194168771231750	@pulte Truly would change mine and my babies life 😭 really behind on bills and just tested positive for covid eariler today and now out of work $KarlyC2 anything would help 🙏🏼
1552830684728811520	Pluck!!!   Just tested positive for Covid.  Knew something was off.   If I die b4 I wake.   Burn me to ashes, stay away, and be safe.
1449115121192669193	@GarretAhearn @NewstalkFM Medical apartheid. I wouldn't mind, the vaccine passports don't even prevent transmission of covid - vaccinated people are spreading the virus and still ending up in hospital. You and Lawless are disgusting.
1476041241834004480	@g_lizzett i got a slight headache and my arm hurt from the shot but nothing serious (: considering i was around a couple of people who tested positive for covid, definitely works than not getting it!
1530855430628450305	I have COVID 😐I've been isolating all week after close contact, and today was supposed to be freedom Day, but instead I tested positive and have to keep isolating.
1549722152009494528	@sasbeach @jayardot1 @jhoban66 @_TahJah @ABC I said this one's I'll say it again vaccines do not stop you from getting covid-19 they just make the symptoms more bearable and hopefully you don't end up in the hospital
1380212569068216322	Tested positive for Covid, today. My breathing is fine but I have intense headache, body aches, and fever 😖
1476935658782474248	@BadgerNoonan I’m talking about the dangers of football and covid TO football players. So yeah, a small population. But it’s a football podcast and guys are missing games for “heath and safety” protocols. Covid hasn’t killed or hospitalized any players, or really anyone of similar health.
1558245962329440256	welp just contracted covid and had to go to the hospital afterwards to make sure everything was okay with my body
1481459462091132928	I’m sorry your child has cancer &amp; no immune system. Let’s give you some Covid while you are in the hospital getting chemotherapy. Come on California. https://t.co/eXxAXi3XlA
1389525711455604738	What's going on now a days.. Recently one of my family member has been tested positive for covid he is admitted in a private hospital in bhiwani #haryana.. Now the point is what is the hospital is selling remdesivir injection in black for 33,000 shame on it..
1416679851331837954	@CarolineLucas IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU TEST POSITIVE IF YOU'VE HAD TWO JABS!.....yeah but you'll spread it I hear you say, so what? majority of people are vaccinated, millions two jabs, so it's effectively herd immunity by vaccination! 👍#freedomdayUK #coronavirus #Covid19 #covid
1431325865376428035	@samijiries I think what helped is to say I’d only get a vaccine if X happened, and then X happened. So I figured I’d be fine if I got covid and went to the ICU, but I’d get vaccinated if there were another wave and the hospitals filled up again. There was another wave, and I got vaccinated.
1541864967993008138	@DBlack_Mountain They are! So I tested positive for Covid this morning🤢😵‍💫
1452282579571380229	"@Tr0llyTr0llFace I caught covid in February of 2020.I begged to get tested. 6 calls to the GP, 4 to the mental health service in charge, 2 visits to the emergency room. They didn't let me in because ""i hadn't been abroad"".I still suffer from long-covid on the daily because i was never helped."
1366440487142494211	Tell you what mind if they’ve whipped up a vaccine for Corona can they do one for a bad hairline as well because I well and truly test positive
1380690596810088455	@wadestotts I work at a hospital, in a unit that takes care of covid patients. When we had people dying who we couldn't send to ICU because it was too full, we allowed family (and still do) to come stay with them. Tbh, I think sometimes we bent the rules to do it. But it's worth it.
1528073312529747970	@g_kayy Its been 18 days since I tested positive for Covid and I'm still coughing and I become short of breath after talking a lot. I can't even imagine trying to do anything physically intense like running.I hope you feel better soon and don't have any lingering symptoms.
1540635893152845826	My housemate tested positive for covid, thankfully I haven't but it's set off my anxiety really badly and in literally not leaving my room until she's no longer sick.&gt;.&lt;
1595480500260507648	I could have said “wasn’t it one of y’all that ended up in the ICU with covid while I (vaccinated) had no symptoms” but i refrained :) https://t.co/gy0UYGZglj
1480113312574619649	@NoMoreISP @GaryEKo1 @Minnie02705819 @Wolf_3_141_59 @ChelseaAnne_S @fordnation So if I break my leg and am admitted to hospital, but am Asymptomatic and test positive, I am counted as a covid case.  With 80% of the population being vaccinated, that will certainly skew the numbers.  That is between 25-35% of the cases.  Apply that to your pie chart.
1618848372999479301	@AnnieForTruth This is Wonderful!! Of course all the Elderly MAGAts won't get Vaxxed anyway, but Who Cares? I firmly believe being vaxxed and boosted allowed my wife and I to get over our Covid faster, and easier.  Otherwise we'd have ended up in ICU or Dead!!🩼🩼🩼❤️👍🇺🇸🇺🇦❤️👍
1501955132501598211	It's good to see this clarity, unfortunately it doesn't really help explain the rise in hospital numbers.(Usual fine print applies: Covid +ive patients have big impact in terms of infection prevention and control, also being +ive can complicate treatment.)
1528417162393706512	“min. 1/3 of the patients at the ICU where I am had a COVID infection in the 6-8 weeks before admission to the ICU. By the time they are admitted, they are usually “recovered”..”
1426112084723572740	@nypost All staff, look vaccinations don’t prevent you getting COVID19 they stop you getting seriously ill…Covid is here forever now , I bet most of us test positive for strep if there was mass testing, we humans carry germs 🦠…..GET VACCINATED
1485129927158800384	We're already suffering from it's repercussions. It's only 10 steps away from our house. From my child to elders, all are Falling sick very often. We've tested dengue positive, COVID positive after this. @CMCCuttack @AnanyaDasIAS
1476258631284760582	I have direct knowledge of at least one elderly person who was admitted to the hospital for a completely unrelated issue. They tested him and it came back positive for Covid. He had no Covid symptoms. He died from complications of the other medical issue. 1/
1562516287817150465	@dgurdasani1 I contracted covid visiting my Mum in hospital in a FFP3 mask.  They refused to test my Mum when I told them I'd  tested  positive.  She was there for pneumonia.
1545512942480809990	@EmmaKennedy Sorry to hear…my Covid fever lasted 10 days…but still tested positive 2 weeks out…hang in there.
1436562237313851394	I’ll be hopping on stream at 11:30 Pacific. I’ll be playing some NBA Give ’N Go in order to send some good vibes Cedric Ceballos’ way (if you haven’t heard, he’s in the hospital with COVID).
1458603978237915142	@RealCarlVernon Presumably tested positive with the unreliable test. Dog is nothing. I know a lemon that has covid.
1488419479562465281	@newsmax Yeah for about the last year, I tested positive for covid the other day but didn't tell anyone or change my plans cause I had no symptoms.
1484021281850900480	"#vaccinated with #COVID19 and hospitalized.Says he still doesn't feel 100% and he brought in the New Year in the hospital.He goes on to say ""thank god I had those 2 shots"" https://t.co/pJbwawkzu6 https://t.co/jaqBTsudKZ"
1381192881604587526	@har_joel @PaulaBrexiteer Or for him to declare a (false) positive Covid test. That would completely get him off the hook. I’ve been expecting this for days.
1386884873391013891	@Rosa5294020917 @mari0br03 @Breaking911 I don't think many people think it's a hoax and you know that too.  Some believe the numbers are inaccurate.  The CDC said on national television people who didn't die from covid are still labeled covid if they test positive.
1378321646201753603	Genuine question, if some people I know have tested positive for COVID supposedly then had the antibody test and their tests have come back saying negative for antibodies, what is the point in the jab???
1386005050078679041	@3rdangelmessen1 I’ve thought about that. The vaccines for instance. All the hype of Quanon. He had different treatment in hospital for Covid. We hear nothing from him. The voter reform ( Georgia) must happen now, for 2022 in all states. No one is working on anything but Biden’s group to kill us.
1508843949712105478	I know a bunch of people who have tested positive in the last few weeks. All mild cases. None would show up in official case counts because they only did home tests and recovered on their own.Makes me wonder if we could have a Stealth Covid Wave b/c of hidden prevalence.
1430832653566058499	Lord, give my tito's family a strength para gumaling sa covid. All 4 of them tested positive. Thus, I'm asking everyone a favor to include their family's fast recovery sa prayers niyo. Salamat!
1349041742356639747	@RepJayapal I am sure if I took the flu shot on January 4th like you did the Covid vaccine, I would test positive for flu only days later. You gave permission for someone to inject &amp; introduce a small amount of a virus into your body, you now positively carry a small amount of that virus.
1475857290045575174	So it’s been 5 days since I tested positive for covid and still no symptoms… the media told me if I’m unvaccinated I should be dead by now yet here I am tweeting
1479088317228584960	@BBCNews It’s been last month since I tested positive for covid and my smell and taste tends to come and go now
1488959248843345923	@GoJoeMac @jordan03__ @Breaking911 I’m not sure if they ever claimed that the vaccines world prevent infection or transmission. They did claim the vaccine would lessen symptoms and potentially prevent one from having to be hospitalized which would help the hospitals from being overloaded with Covid patients. 🤷🏻‍♂️
1483453939676848140	It really took COVID 2 full years to get me to test positive. Failure of a disease
1377206117466521600	@NicolaDonnan @mlchealth Extremely sad for those families with their lives changed forever. I wouldn’t make assumptions about how long people might have spent in ICU as Covid19 can be very fast acting as I have witnessed myself. I’d like to hear how the public health officials explain the sudden increase
1478123857709973508	I just want to stay home all day and not be around anyone. So many people at work tested positive for COVID and now I’m just anxious all the time
1376585827891953678	My vaccinated roommate tested positive for covid this morning. L
1483651036371996679	Tested positive for covid on Thursday. Coughing, can’t smell, my face and eyes feel so swollen but still have to go to work 😩
1462602239734808577	@LeisaSchaim Great question. I wasn’t able to qualify for the Cedars-Sinai Long COVID program specifically because no positive test! My situation was complicated bc I lost my insurance &amp; became unemployed just a few months before catching COVID, so going further out of pocket was unthinkable
1486065565978533901	@F4bP4m Oh I have had congregations and loved it.  I've moved to chaplaincy to care for those in need in hospitals, such as COVID patients in the ICU.
1383121886477836288	@Live2teachLives @Wolfiesmom Yup, first shot the effects were mild, but after #2 I did opt for sleeping the next day off! I had many of the symptoms with #2 that I had with Covid except the nausea that was so bad it sent me to the ER. Each symptom had its own 15 minutes of fame, but the nausea was a no-show!
1404564257740517376	But I thought the vaccines were developed too quick and they’re not to be trusted! Funny how vaccinated people are rarely among those hospitalized with COVID-19…🤨 https://t.co/8kAFTE8HaB
1417502781003374602	Feels we're heading for 1918 all over again. Honestly, how can you claim to be awake and enlightened, but then you tell people to go and take crazy risks with this virus around.  This isn't a joke.  I've been in ICU and I live with a chronic condition.  You don't want one. #covid
1479878592431599624	Tested positive for covid and felt  like Magic Johnson when they told him he had aids. Now I gotta do a sit down with Katie Couric and reflect on how I got here🤦🏾‍♂️
1480591860540354570	"I wonder if Boris Johnson recognises that a ""Living with the virus"" policy might actually get himself killed. He'll always get the best care, of course, but it's not a 100%. Is he too egotistical to accept he might have a genetic weakness to Covid that put him in hospital?"
1379901624873840640	@gobills_norcal @JoshAllenQB I want to win championships. Having him hospitalized or getting his legs amputated due to COVID because he doesn’t believe in science is probably the dumbest thing ever. If that’s the case, start Trubisky
1354220728342761472	@GoodDog94619152 They spiked the flu vaccine to test positive for Covid, I'm positive!
1537463540013223936	Mick Jagger has Tested Positive for COVID!...I am Shattered! 🥺
1381271822998573059	@LizSzabo I had a very mild first infection, and after the first shot had a wild extended response. Once it was done I've felt better than I have all year, and I think it cleared an un-diagnosed mild long COVID.
1382468187283853313	@chrisvanderveen I know I mentioned this last week, but I really want to know how many of the hospitalized were eligible for the vaccine. As a family who has hard core quarantined and gotten the vaccine, I don't want to keep covid protocols for those who choose not to vaccine
1389870965514018822	@jtylerbrandt @neontaster Well, when you take into consideration, just about all admissions to ER were diagnosed as CoVid even prior to testing available, I see your point.
1581450794272174081	Covid tests:Test 1 was also the day I got a PCR test (PCR was positive)Test 2 (image with stuff on counter) taken the day after my PCR test results after 8 minutes.Test 3 is from today, very positive after 3 minutes. https://t.co/GuRNRZRpsl
1506351333804175360	@EricTopol @JoelAchenbach My kids college used rapids this spring semester for identify Covid cases.first 8 weeks-over 10% of class tested positive.  None have been put into the state count.
1517469422738415618	Many I know have tested positive for Covid recently, some are sure they had it but didn’t bother testing.  Not sure how many bothered to report test results on Govt site.  How will you know what is happening @nadhimzahawi ?  Or does this suit??
1474829782634274817	@0xHustler I can relate to this. Idk if it was covid since I didn't go to the hospital because they have this thing where a slight scrap here in PH will be declared Covid. But man, losing my sense of taste and smell messed me up.
1371912570811088899	Lol @ the dude I work with who never wears his mask right, talks about how he doesn't trust the COVID vaccine, &amp; tested positive for COVID today. Your dumbassery means I get to work from home in my sweats for the next two weeks now.
1448671407869677570	@Jmes_80 I was taken into hospital with suspected Covid. The paramedics said it was, doctor in A+E agreed. Isolated on ward. Consultant said if I  hadn't had my jabs it would have been. Downgraded to severe chest infection. 10 days later was good as new 😅🇸🇬
1372680452432138240	are you KIDDING ME two days into training at my new job they’re putting me into a 2 week isolation because a partner i came into contact with apparently just tested positive for covid 😐
1505041030629900290	and now han tested positive for covid…i hope for his and changbin’s good health to come
1620115935939158016	@rhymeswithvery @CarlFle47251645 @robertbenda @IanCopeland5 @React19org From the OPs original tweet, he states he has had both an adverse vax effect and long COVID, two different things, not related. So, yes, a diagnosed effect of the vax, which def should be researched, and I agree, not easy to determine.
1468271949021392900	@callumjodwyer I'm so sorry you are dealing with this. I was hospitalized with a mystery virus in 2019 that has caused some long term effects on me, namely POTS. It terrifies me to get Covid bc of this. I hope you are able to find some relief, healing and answers.
1383260265349742596	@ocparkbuilder I am doing fine. Still waiting on word from my folks who have both been diagnosed with COVID on Tuesday
1472793619450843137	This is WILD. They contradicted themselves by saying those who are vaccinated could test positive and it would be mild. Then said to protect yourself get vaccinated, get a booster and wear a mask. So I’m going to do all 3 of those things and STILL get “COVID” WTF 😭😒🤦🏽‍♀️
1471238227357061120	Back to this @Chiefs COVID nonsense - ever notice how it’s only “key players” who test positive?  Never the WR5 or backup punter.  I’m calling bullshit.
1483877785114456064	@SolNataMD All I can do is shake my head. I don't understand the disconnect. All these people died from #Covid. The numbers are real. We can't control many things in life, but we can choose to get #Vaccinated. I don't want people to get this virus, be hospitalized &amp; die. Can I help you?
1385285766876631047	@adriandorrian Been scratching my head about that one too! COVID occupied beds may be those in hospital solely because of the virus, the larger inpatient figure including those who got a +ve diagnosis while in hospital with something else, but that's a guess. Can you help @publichealthni?

I guess no testing, no covid???🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
1467907013443297281	Waiting for a COVID test.  I was exposed to someone diagnosed with COVID, have symptoms myself, so waiting 'til the testing team arrives.  If you test positive with or without a vaccine, please don't wait four days to tell those you've had close contact.  Sincerely, please.
1489787832344346625	Doctor called. Covid test came out positive so my surgery was canceled. They told me to call back in 2 weeks to reschedule.😐 fuck my lifeee I’m just tryna get this shit over with already so I can start getting my life back😒

1436102725708750848	@Rockies 5/8One of my greatest fears is having to go to the ER because it will mean #COVID19 is no longer under my control and perhaps too bad to bounce back from. For now, I'm treating it as I do the flu and that's kept it in check.⬇️
1480500701084200962	I'm just a normal person who hasn't had any covid vaccines. Had covid and symptoms were very mild. I'm still here and haven't been to hospital. Jabbed or not you can still catch and spread covid.Apparently #VaccinesWork https://t.co/vZdeiPjiHs
1449041772995305476	@POTUS There is no progress if you are the reason for thousands of Americans losing their jobs.I just thought vaccinations protected those who got the jab.  Why the concern with unvaccinated?No one is discussing the fact that vaccinated Americans are diagnosed everyday with Covid.?????

1438603084289085473	@ATrumpublican @BenWinslow @fox13 Never going happen. I've had a serious adverse reaction to a vaccine that hospitalized me and I had covid (not the worst cold I've ever had) and now I have natural immunity. I'll take that anyday. I'll NEVER allow someone to force inject me. Did Nuremberg trials teach us nothing?

1484521824008679425	My sympathies for the Bangaloreans. I had bad covid and was in the icu in 2020, then had two vaccines and still got high fever for a week a few days back. And our Twitter gyani wants even this Sunday lockdown removed.
1438573597438713861	@DaMockracy @MagicalBovine @NikkiFried @HHSGov Exactly, I agree with you.  But it still leaves some unknowns, hence my suggesting that we need more granular level of data to be collected.  Was Covid the primary or secondary reason for being admitted.  What was oxygen level, how many days were they hospitalized for, etc…

I expected lots of people being diagnosed with Chronic Bronchiectasis, caused by the virus, but I haven't heard any reports.
1467576006735282183	@krnlg It's a theory. Not sure how there could be fewer illnesses due to isolation? Maybe they are jammed with covid patients. I just find it odd that as an older person in a little community where everyone knows everyone else's business I don't know anyone who has been in hospital..

1478788269743779851	"@SrikanthTalagad @atrupar I agree, i also think the ""hospitalized with covid"" vs ""hospitalized due to covid"" has some validity, which makes it hard to discuss , ""unplanned hospital intake"" would be a better stat - basically comparing overall unexpected hospitalization rates to a pre-pandemic year."

1385284056372424706	Just a thought ... daily covid cases in UK fairly static around 2,500 - but with a false positive rate in any test how much can be explained by that? 1,375,409 tests, 2,729 new cases on 21st April, if all cases were false positive would still be an impressive 0.2% rate. Help me!
1472237132274151428	@FootyAccums When is this gonna end regarding covid, if players are having to miss 2 games with a positive test regardless of symptoms then I don’t know how they can even bother playing the season out. Either let them play or cancel it all I don’t see another option
1523392814825959426	@VickySy59746904 Hi, Vicky.  Thanks for messaging with Delta! My name is Jan. I am sorry that you tested positive for COVID. Please DM us for assistance.
1451205194994184197	@EzraKahan I'm unvaccinated as well as my family,  and we had covid last month, no issues, minor symptoms.The only person I know who ended up in hospital and then in ICU, was 2x vaxxed
1482404728348688386	@MFparkhurst I am sorry for disturbing you, I need your help by simply retweet Im a Non Binary Black Trans and I just tested positive for COVID and I unable to work. I need food and medical supplies. I hope you will understand me. Thank you.https://t.co/Tc1AeEd4CV
1378143978277720067	@mckenzie_ann827 See my covid test came back positive but like I ain’t coughing I feel like I have flu x10 I’ve had a fever of 103 for 5 days now that won’t go away
1475961999729254402	I have tested positive for Covid. I am a responsible young man so I will stay home, but you’re a fucking pussy if you let this god damn cold hither your days. I’ve already got my NBA2k22 MyPlayer from a 94 to a 96 overall. I feel like I could average at least 4 YPC for the Lions.
1374390353713786880	Now I understand why we can't keep people at my job.After having covid you could test positive for up to 3 months, yet we have to have a negative test to go back.
1480412019119460352	@AnnastaciaMP I am just gobsmacked by the blatant lies being pushed by our Premier. We all know that there are hardly any kids in hospital sick FROM covid. They tested positive but are in there because of a broken leg and normal kids injuries. #Criminal
1475221567688818692	Someone I know (triple-vaccinated) cancelled their Christmas dinner because they did a rapid test yesterday &amp; thought it was positive. It was only today that they texted a picture to their family &amp; found out that the “C” means control &amp; not COVID. They’re mortified 😞
1438158859642757120	@RobertKennedyJr Haha I love watching our Covid patients die: they refuse to vaccinate and are causing nationwide hospital overcapacity crisis. Congrats on finding that 1 adverse reaction event btw. Please don't vaccinate: Ill enjoy watching you die from Covid, in the ER, unable to get a room.
1453791064398045189	@stuartpstevens @RonDeSantisFL It is Florida so I’ve assumed that Covid cases are extremely underreported since reported as a with Covid means the “Libs won” - so many just suck it up and suffer - eventually some will go to the hospital.
1553511203695108097	@DineshDSouza 👀 if my numbers was that bad and Americans are outraged of this recession I would say that I got leprosy😭😭😭😭😭😭NOBODY Catches COVID AGAIN THAT FAST AND HIS DOCTOR IS A QUACK  NOBODY HIS AGE 91 yrs old gets Covid and is not in the hospital COME ON MAN STOP PLAYING SICK 😭
1419267787353071616	"Imo, people who don't get the covid-19 vaccine are stupid, ignorant, and selfish. They have no right going around infecting other people and costing us a fortune in hospital bills when all that could be avoided. Their ""rights"" are infringing on my RIGHTS to be safe and healthy!"
1488282582940729344	@NewsOu812 @PeaceLion5 @ColorMEInsane @Desiree73122637 @MessyBessy11 @annieomiss @RobertMuller @sarob54 And the hospitals are strained.Ten hour wait times in ER for broken ribs, only to be sent home strainedDoctors not able to take apps.My work employees 163 people, a third are out due to covid or close contact
1474923973137735685	@Disgustington69 I'm feeling more Grinch like than usual😂 our xmas plans got cancelled thanks to covid! So annoying as we're all as 'careful' as poss but que sera, my wee nephew tested positive. Least it was before we all arrived &amp; he's feeling OK. Will give a listen when not in Grinch mode😂 https://t.co/GkIiQSznNQ
1596243954936184833	In the first few weeks of a real rise in covid locally, working in the ER was the most difficult thing I'd done in my life. We knew nothing. China had barred people in their homes. I was walking directly into rooms to clean them of the virus, with so. Many. Questions... 1/2.
1503463448453201933	@Sean_Shinil_Kim 2, an older couple who were told they were reinfected with COVID within a week of being vaccinated and the symptoms were worse than the first time they caught it.  No deaths, but they were both hospitalized while I know no one else hospitalized after the vax or COVID.
1484180449878544384	Can’t prove it by me! My in-law was vaxxed and caught COVID. Had 30% oxygen level. Almost frigging DIED. In hospital for 2 WEEKS. Has a heart ailment now and is on heart meds…and is ONLY 33! So, STFU.
1376993720864813063	@MoldingDrLesane Dhhs of NC. I tested positive for Covid last Friday. They informed me that I didn’t have to go and get tested again after quarantine b/c the antibodies are active for 90 days.
1425262868786606081	@LizMathiasen Since I had 3 negative PCR tests yeah that is the consensus. And I'm not being heard when I point out that infected immunosuppressed folks tend to test positive less.My PCP was... upset... that I keep saying I think I have COVID.
1538955147505721345	Today I submitted an important piece of public scholarship and got notice that both of my co-authored proposals for a workshop this fall were accepted!Let’s hope this positive streak continues into the COVID* test results I’m waiting on… 😬
1489997479642902528	@374Trishamc @pluincee You just said none were hospitalized. I know around 400 children in my local school have had covid and none were hospitalized. I have sat at a xmas dinner table pre-covid and 75% of people have had cold symptoms. We have short memories
1373406179745992708	@MarkLazerus Wow, live in Tinley Park and is an essential worker and she can't get the shot, even though she was hospitalized for Covid and had pneumoniain November.  You couldn't be considered an essential worker since you do everything via zoom, so I can't understand how you got one?
1376962429175881733	Just got this email from a survey place I’ve gotten paid to do stuff at. Wanna get some money for getting covid? Gimme a little kickback off what they give you and I’ll forward the email 😉. Had to have tested positive in the last 9 days apparently. https://t.co/D6TaSAMUoS
1416380540765286400	@easyJet Hi if I have tested positive for covid and therefore have to isolate am I entitled to a refund on my flight Monday?
1490497772067647494	@BruceHoult @chrishipkins Let me know when there's three more zeros.The only important figure is 14 people 'with' or 'of' Covid in hospital. That's it.And that needs breaking down. With or of ... how many in each category. Age?Then for those 'of' is it Delta or Omicron.We work from that data.
1471342289549205505	@jetta713 @MdBreathe @emilymiller Might not be Covid then.  My symptoms were very mild.  About 4 to 5 days then recovered fully around day 7/8.  However full loss of taste and smell was key and those of us that had it, ALL tested positive..But you have to do the test at the right time.  Teammates didn't have it.
1473398751217737735	@dad195B @DavidLe66212627 @BorisJohnson Unless they tested positive cause they can go on covid death list which helps Stoke more fear so more boosters I.e. vaccines which came out before omicron can be administered the bloke should stick to his illegal raves he has backing of @metpoliceuk historic cases unit 🙊🙉🙈
1457866125828624385	Great.A classmate of mine tested positive for COVID and bc I have such severe allergies, I sounded symptomatic over the phone so now I'm locked out of Columbia buildings. https://t.co/62SCWRoMQF
1484394501984571392	Have to miss an indie wrestling show and more importantly a celebration of life for someone because a roommate tested positive for Covid. I'm so fucking tired of this shit.
1436436471402033155	@Andie00471 I work with a bunch of anti vaxxers, in a hospital no less. The hospital recently mandated vaccines. They were all big talk about refusal until they realized they would lose their jobs. Now one of those same people is in the ICU with Covid. The ignorance is ridiculous.
1486460827276386305	@christin3_t @nagle_william @OccupyDemocrats Dude are you seriously slow I never said hospitals are murdering people I said that hospitals test everybody for Covid regardless of what they’re therefore and if you die regardless of why if you tested positive you’re getting Covid as you’re death cause
1471623000386846720	everytime i have to attend a business meeting outside, i have to test myself if im covid positive or not good lord. my nose cant take this anymore
1568921199291293697	@findbread It gave me COVID, not worth it (I tested positive like 6 days after I saw it in theaters)
1474098211866349573	Roommate tested positive for covid so I'm spending xmas alone fml 😔
1464714854606929920	Unfortunately they are not letting me in to see him bc I am no the immediate next of kin and he's in the COVID wing. So I'm here to support my family members who are here and I'll be spending my time in the hospital chapel praying This is rough y'all
1452725455606452231	STOP! This’s pathetic. I’m sorry for his loss but please they can’t even tell you how ppl are being diagnosed without lying! To all who will absolutely love this tweet, ask how is #DELTA diagnosed? #DoNotComply #CovidLies #Covid19
1374829259714363399	@PonziniG Definitely. I'm a little jaded after watching psych and other prevention services at our hospital get furloughed during covid. Its so backwards. Having $ data helped save our tobacco program, so something similar could be done to promote pysch in the ER
1479093693982420993	@HealWithKasey I’m knocking on wood multiple times throughout this tweet. I am fully vaccinated, I work with the public (see 1,000+ people daily, 90%+ of them wear masks), and I was around my partner for two weeks when he unknowingly had COVID last March. Have not tested positive once.
1450550226134179846	@VarolianBrandon @Breaking911 I had same symptoms when I had Covid. I am unvaccinated never went to Dr never went to hospital and I am older than him and have diabetes. Good immune system.
1480314746532360192	@mikehdt @CarmelaParkin @CaseyBriggs Good because a lot of them are incidental findings for people presenting/admitted to hospital for other reasons not COVID - they need start reporting the true + cases from COVID in hospital. Everyone in hospital is tested for COVID - I had shoulder surgery and was tested
1428080483397681154	@Redpainter1 @maddow Masks and vaccines are only for them liberals...I'd rather be holed up in hospital somewhere (if I'm lucky enough to get a bed), suffering through all the COVID symptoms, receiving a very expensive antibody treatment that I probably don't have coverage for. - Alabamans (probably)
1476763279968063498	@catturd2 I would go to the ER immediately you most likely have covid and have a 1% chance of death, get your particulars in order.
1442411307223986177	This sucks on my way to hospital cause my kid is sick hopefully he doesn’t have covid
1474100806219710469	@Mi_Astronauta @covert_raccoon @Antonio_Caramia @DrEricDing @TigressEllie @HoppySaul @DocVatsa @AlisonGeorge10 @DRTomlinsonEP @lisa_iannattone @Zubhaque @SurajitStat @drppalazzolo @jneill But not in the hospital man, and not covid for sure, i know from childs which grow slower now that they had covid.

1357076468312981506	@NHSuk I will have it no questions asked we all take risks everyday in life so why not have a vaccine that could save your life personally I see it better than getting covid and in hospital etc roll on group 6
1544498815994036225	@Mary_0584 Take care Mary. I hate to say it but take a Covid test. I know people in Tennessee Oklahoma &amp; Hawaii who are positive right now.
1355499723143204867	@Paul1971EFC @UKCovid19Stats I know 3 people in fact the only 3 people I know who have had a vaccine have suffered terrible side affects 1 is now in hospital “unrelated” off course. Wonder how many deaths are down to the wonder vaccine 🤔
1512644841653817344	Morning got up n saw this . I m happy enough to see this ♥️. Even Though i was tested negative but i was suffering like positive but alhamdulilah  . Thanks u all who was with me during this hard days . Love you guys ♥️. Covid is really a killer. Stay safe everyone ♥️ https://t.co/bzSRxbvxxb
1561223749088825349	@yummysdaydream I went to that concert, and tested positive for Covid on the 15th 🥲 I wasn’t even sick when I went to the concert!! I started having symptoms Saturday night and soon as I got back home to Orlando at 3am Monday, I went to the ER bc I felt like shit. Ended up being positive 🥹
1440532500959297537	BREAKING—Brazil's health minister just tested positive for #COVID19 in NYC for #UNGA . He is part of 🇧🇷’s delegation to the UN with @jairbolsonaro, who refuses to vaccinate, and violating NYC Mayor @BilldeBlasio’s indoor vaccine mandate! ➡️ I warned this!!https://t.co/kgbU3NbG91
1476289192086970371	@katiesaurusrex Just tested positive on the 26th too. Hopefully yours is mild like mine seems to be. Got double jabbed in the summer but I likely caught covid when I went to go get my booster jab on the 23rd from someone else at the vac centre.
1559706094552981505	@shortridge_matt @megan_bank @Venusjade @atrupar I got covid, no vax, sniffles, and i got to catch up on my sleep… I’ve been traveling like crazy. Oddly, never got covid again.  Can’t say that about my vax’ed, 4x boosted mask wearing acquaintances who have tested positive multiple times…
1503229266628014080	@TheRealDogPoun1 So how do these stats work? EVERYTIME 50 people get Covid I get hospitalized?
1452862809071575040	a patient tested positive :( im soooooo done with covid
1502266101140492297	@allypetersnews @News_8 Confirmed yes.  But a group of us was sick in February 2020 after FL trip, but didn’t know it was in US yet. Took antibody test in May and I had .96 when positive was 1.0. Dr. told me I probably had COVID.
1379168748125495297	@JuliaHB1 I agree but they should still be worn in hospitals and hygiene standard kept the same as the level during Covid. After all how many caugh it in hospital?
1483372367393206276	@DsekhonD @Christie_Whelan BruhI’ve been called an idiot for literally calling out the people you describe. I was insulted and blocked by someone who said they’d call 000 if they tested positive to covid.Don’t deflect
1444059979804123137	@Ezekiel_Speaks @Stinkyb95685021 @LargeWalex Well this is getting...repetitive, so I'm out. All I'm gonna say is, and I genuinely mean this without trying to sound like an ass, but I'm sure I sound like one anyways, I really hope COVID doesn't force you to the ICU, or kills you due to your own ignorance. Cheers.
1595735002129453056	@Suv2015 @HW26651 Many are. I know people who died &amp;or lost family. I bet many people you know lost a loved one due to a battle with COVID, or had a loved one very ill or hospitalized. Your sarcasm won’t magically return those who’ve passed away to their chair at this year’s Thanksgiving table.
1479114944620625921	How is it that I dont go out or anything but I test positive for Covid ????
1372719764888375297	So I came home and learned that1) Kurls has tested positive for COVID2) Freddy is hurt3) A younster took Quaider's number4) Jack has added to his hockey vocabularybut Bruins are leading so I'm still happy
1379067437988122638	So I was sent home early Friday after one positive &amp; one negative Covid test. After all weekend long of me not leaving the house, I get a call about an hour ago from the state lab saying it was a false positive!! ( figured b/c I had my vaccine less than 48hrs before) #COVERED https://t.co/dKThPKyNSz
1462881246766325764	One of my besties tested positive for Covid today and I hate this feeling. 😔 they’re feeling decent at the moment. Hoping for a fast recovery.
1429840308355821568	What's it like to get COVID after vaccination?  “I don’t think I would have even known I had COVID unless I tested positive,” @fabflutist2716 says. https://t.co/OLocLHHP3x
1431727176324423688	@CBSNews Hundreds of thousands went and how many actually got covid and how many got hospitalized? I’m betting almost none!
1483617443012558850	@AsaHutchinson @ADHPIO How many people are in the hospital because of COVID?   I can only think of one reason this info is never made available.
1373698461028204549	@GovMurphy @NJDeptofHealth So 10% of my States residents have tested positive. I find that hard to believe. Only about 5 people out of everyone I know in NJ has had Covid.
1441107765246586895	@FinFan63 @KeithFu08737671 @Cap_WSalmon @IngrahamAngle I'm on my second year working in the ER during this virus.  The vaxxed ARE coming in COVID+.  Some of them are also getting admitted.  Which also means they are CARRIERS.  Stop with the bullshit.  The vaccinated are infecting people just as much as non vaxxed.
1474527836484653057	I wish the temp would plummet.Then the outdoor maskers will be able to view their breath swirling about and covering each others heads.Will they then realise masks are an exercise in futility.Like being in hospital and catching NHS issue Covid from NHS maskers.Works well??
1478644055714451456	I think… I maybe got a positive covid test. Just maybe.
1385390358167687170	@jacktwoonefive @SoBronxSchool @MelanatedSamus @CommonS38855867 @ChristieNold My agenda is what I see. My school’s dashboard says we’ve had 1 positive Covid test from school testing all year. We’ve been closed twice for ten days and once again for one. I’ve gotten like fifteen emails about positive tests. And it’s not from outside tests.
1435194350342914050	I just tested positive for Covid (I’m dead 😂) damn you Wuhan scientist!
1441184283419308040	@YardleyShooting 84 is the average age I've read recently for those being in ICU with Covid...However, like earlier on the pandemic,,many of these people never tested positive when admitted in to hospital. Then there this https://t.co/syw5Dc3Uky
1473078529139036160	Tested positive today. I have had covid before plus I am fully vaccinated. And still got it. Please get tested AGUers.
1396874692011692032	@DanielSeal20 Because you don’t want to be that unlucky 24 year old?Covid doesn’t always pray on the vulnerable. I know of an older couple. She was well not on any meds but died - her internal organs shut down, her husband with heart disease and diabetes tested positive had no symptoms.
1458180093084307468	I wonder if any of the staff are unjabbed , that cared for @BorisJohnson when he was in hospital with ‘Covid.’He will happily sack these people in a few months after they saved his life.
1437557092840316929	@OpalAunt @HeroicWill @Cernovich Fact check me on this. I think if death occurs within 28 days of a positive COVID test, COVID is listed as the cause of death, regardless of OD status, gunshot, accident or other contributing factors.
1379826547037773825	@katebefree1996 @dougmastriano @russdiamond @RepScottPerry If you are speaking state records, I am staking that they are counting all deaths that test positive vs. died OF COVID.  Read CDC revisions. Staggering drop in deaths.  This was always about control and election.
1344270471764783106	@Johnny_Dice_ @catturd2 Well, in a normal vaccine, an antibody test will absolutely pop positive, but this is not a normal vaccine, it is an RNA ...somethingorother... so it should produce COVID specific T-cells, which we do not (so far as I know) know how to test for.
1476309407721996294	i vented about it on priv a bit, but someone at my office tested positive for covid w/o telling ppl, and i’m kinda panicking bc i came in contact w/ him -_- just wondering now where the hell i’m going to get tested
1447728771876933637	I note that yesterday almost as many people tested positive for covid with PCR tests as were vaccinated with shots 1&amp;2 combined. #GenocideJohnson must be cracking the bubbly in his borrowed holiday mansion well away from the covid and Brexit crises. His plans.
1421685462855393283	I’d like to propose a simple concept:If you refuse vaccination and then are hospitalized for COVID, health insurance covers nothing…zilch…nada…all expenses related to treatment will be 100% out-of-pocket AND and they’ll either be dead or broke.#MAGA
1488034674416881665	@DrHarryThomas I'm so sorry. I was just diagnosed with covid for a second time on Friday. That is TWICE in one month. I'm vaccinated and take major precautions due to being a CNA and having a child with Hereditary Chronic Pancreatitis.  I'm so very sorry you are battling this awful plague.
1523953537658535936	@LeeC2030 @ActuaryByDay @TRyanGregory @COVID19actuary @WHO If that was the case I'd agree with you. But a positive test is neither necessary nor sufficient for COVID to be added to a death certificate.
1557569991855185921	First day of college is in five days and I just tested positive for covid 🧍
1540905000854888448	I caught Covid at a single #bced indoor event.It is not mild for me. I’m triple vaccinated but was in the ER today due to asthma. This is not sustainable or safe. Call me anxious, but I will do anything to avoid this “new normal” in the future @JM_Whiteside @adriandix https://t.co/6wpjqwP47I
1577082321131671560	@BrugMomemt @texas22aj @boboeskotten @business LOL -- dude, he's incredibly mentally ill.  He's hospitalized about suicide.To the point, that unless I see a signed coroners report, I won't believe that he died of 'COVID' and that the loon didn't just kill himself and the family is running cover for him to milk sympathy.
1417961169864757249	@NHSEngland @BBCHughPym I have a family member who is going into hospital on Friday for a major operation, no visitors no one their to support/help recovery. But this person, apparently so ill from covid is allowed a random reporter and a camera crew in a room with him! Thank you @NHSEngland
1380157442978373639	unfortunately haven't felt well since yesterday and this morning had to go for a covid test the first time, not a pleasant experience but needed to be done. Now bed ridden until I get the results, hopefully be positive! stay safe everyone.UTV! ⚽️👊🦁
1443378641023508492	@chipfranklin Yes I do. For the next so many months until more people r vaxed &amp; the spread of the deadly Covid19/Delta variant viruses have pretty much stopped spreading! So many children ending up in the hospital. Masks can help reduce spread!
1515357599247618048	@fortycankissit @DawnsMission Twitter was not allowing many of these stories to be communicated. I went into anaphylactic shock from the vaccine, hospitalized for 4 day, then got Covid-19, given antiviral &amp; now in Respiratory Failure.
1483592819570794496	Just tested positive for Covid. Thank god that I l only have the cough and stuffy/ runny nose. If it wasn’t for the vaccine and booster it could have been much worse.
1466577911951945730	@Jim_Jordan If only Covid 19 were done with real America. Last person I did a Covid-19 test on was a 24 hr old infant. Result Positive.
1476916573747257374	@Jim_Jordan Explain why the highest percentage of people in the hospital ICU’s are the unvaccinated!!  You say it doesn’t work!  I am vaccinated and boosted and I got covid BUT it was no worse than a bad cold!!  Explain that oh negative one!!  You are truly ignorant!!
1450563250215661572	@cSEXI4 I just had covid, I spent a week in the hospital, as I got better my doctor said that out of his 23 beds with covid? About 40% were vaccinated
1377084948100878347	@breeds50 @ChrisLongKSTP However if the kids are not positive with Covid they can’t spread it.  No harm to anyone so don’t punish healthy kids.  That is my point.  The means are there to test them.
1488410213564792837	I'm traveling from India to USA. I tested COVID positive about 4 weeks back and recovered since then. Per CDC USA, I don't need to get a Covid negative test again. But do I still need a negative COVID test result to board a Etihad flight? Why?@etihad
1455215702743343105	@BohemianSkeptic @Last_Crusader73 @disneyglimpses People dying from covid doesn't reach anywhere near anything else... besides the flu/pneumonia/ common cold. Tobacco use doubles the death rate each year. Everyone knows someone that ended up in hospital tobacco linked issues... I don't know NEone that had covid let alone die.
1421235719167778819	Im pretty sure im about to test positive for covid being fully vaxxed as well but in GA… ppl dont give a rats ass over here and the delta strain running through these hoes like a track meet
1415451065563160577	@hopelessonelost :( sorry to hear that. Technically I think your group should be fine. No one should be hospitalized should you get COVID. It’s the unvaccinated ppl Who should be worried about the variants.
1385036383874519042	@Sasha60079332 @myfoodhasnoface @JoJoFromJerz @funder I mean I am still masking when in public because I have 3 young children who are at high risk, but I feel liberated by the fact that if I am exposed to covid I won't end up in the hospital or dead. I've got a lot of life to live, and I can't wait to see what my kids accomplish.
1471619576291069954	@gingersnap4004 This is ridiculous. What I want to know is how many of these players have symptoms and who don’t. Because they just played a game Sunday and two days later have a Covid positive test.. meaning they already had Covid. Definitely needs to be a change on future protocols
1549120056235536384	Covid has killed the flu, notice that there are no one with the flu in hospital,it’s all about the money , no money for flu but plenty for Covid, I does not take much to understand why Covid is on the rise it’s about the money
1557402140112367616	@ShadeFNPC I miss you too! I'll try to join in one of your next streams since its been a while, I tested positive for covid on Sunday so I've been miserable but a bit better than I have been
1477758283914096643	@Tim_Bousquet What's your point? That everyone is at fault for getting Covid? I am tired of shaming people who test positive. Those masks and 6ft will do nothing for you now w/ omicron, people catch it from asymptomatic ppl at work and spread it their family. Shame on them for working eh?
1459886152140443652	@joeb_EY @fugueur Thanks Joe, since having Covid &amp; then diagnosed with long Covid this is the 1st Sunday walk I have felt able to do.  I walked just about 4 miles, from where the Loughton Brook meets the River Roding to Woodford Bridge along a very muddy, stinging nettle strewn path, it was lovely https://t.co/YsJ9Xz4XPm
1381334745792053249	@creon @kristenrchoi None of the ER docs or ICU nurses I know tested positive for COVID, and all got the shot.
1426522995334471687	@EssexPR What I don't get is...me being unvaccinated just had a negative pcr/ later flow test sitting next to someone at football game or in a pub who is vaccinated but is positive for covid! 🤷‍♂️ (Living in Ireland atm and can't even sit in a cafe for a coffee without a covid passport)
1421418017926356999	@CwtchyQ @woodydudecoyb So many are still not seeing it...I don't know what to say...he's been this way since being hospitalized with Covid.. WTF went on there
1405644434243477504	@damarifreedom @HseThistleRose @RyanSeifert9 @NPR I’ll be sure to keep this in mind while I take care of children in the ICU that are seriously affected by COVID19.
1474643422728241156	"I think we need to ask is that ""for"" COVID or ""with"" COVID as they're is no reason to be in hospital ""for"" COVID of you don't have any symptoms of disease."
1431616093588705283	Story Time:When the pandemic first started, a yt trump supporting nurse tried to tell me that COVID didn’t exist… She worked in the ICU…. She and her whole family then caught COVID#TheEnd
1437421040330813444	@shrimpzoo I have coached a few people whom were vaccine injured. I know someone who got the first Pfizer shot whom developed acute liver failure and was hospitalized. I also know a few people whom were full vaccinated whom died from Covid and the medical establishment.
1378717176044138499	Actually I know someone who got the vaccine and then was tested positive for Covid 3 weeks later 🤦🏻‍♀️I'm not on it, I'm just not. Let me hibernate for the rest of my life, I don't care I'm not your guineapig.
1476595717473030145	It appears as though the primary diagnosis update is due tomorrow, at which point I'll update my analysis of the proportions and absolute numbers of those who are in hospital with COVID the primary cause.
1403424016510115840	@griptmedia Had a close contact from a week ago tell me they'd tested positive Wednesday. Got a 5 pack of antigen tests from Lidl, negative, immediately got on with my life. I still to this day have never had a PCR test and have no covid antibodies
1471932663623729158	@DrTomFrieden You used a fallacious denominator: Now be honest and tell us the odds of heart complications for those hospitalized BECAUSE of COVID vs. those who were stupid enough (like me) to get jabbed?
1420466708125523972	@gtconway3dg There is a very efficient way of getting most of the remaining morons vaccinated: pass a state law that says that any unvaxxed person who shows up to the hospital with Covid, must be turned away. Remember their cute slogan: my body, my choice. Well, our tax dollars, our choice.
1612588237834563586	"@sewlove33 @RaeSmit50863716 @JessicaLexicus Yeah. People test once at the beginning of feeling sick and don't get a positive result, and they're like, ""Well, I guess it's not COVID!"" when it could very well be COVID. I wear a KN95, too."
1424444988755222535	@AttackonTyson I’ll never forget the day one of my bosses told me I had faked a positive COVID test to get PTO. Saying I paid or sweet hearted one of the nurses at the clinic to fake a positive COVID result. Ironically there was no PTO for COVID at the time . I was sick for 3 weeks .
1475277270541422595	@nicolacoxint @mlbkiwi That’s just with Covid patients. The last few times I’ve been unlucky enough to be in ICU there was maybe only one or two beds free for a few hours, at most a day. And this was before Covid.
1463458214050213894	#pfizervaccinesideeffects @pfizer Just to let everyone know that 48 hrs after taking the Pfizer vaccine I was admitted into hospital with a major heart attack, apparently I'm not the only one to have had a heart attack after taking the vaccine, #COVID19
1429971943898456076	@FLevered @DunkinsGirl @mubazieric @POTUS Well exactly, I only got the shot just so that I won’t have to wear the mask, but now they’re pushing vaccinated people to keep wearing them. It’s ridiculous, if you’re healthy then you won’t have much to worry about if you get it. They act like COVID puts everyone in the ICU.
1448791410379878423	Update! Went and got tested for covid today, the fast test came back negative but however because I am A- symptomatic, they came in and did another test and swab up the nose lol and I will find out in 1 to 3 days but until I do I am quarantined. But I'll be 😮 if it's positive.
1446633345237061633	@Satposts @JesseKellyDC Hey I’m much older than 40 not vaccinated got Covid in august and it was the worst flu I ever had but never got close to going to hospital and zero side effects. So next?
1580216808698568704	@IPizza666 @teamshumanfox @1883Of @BrownTabby23 @myrabatchelder When I was in hospital I didn't follow any covid rules and never wore a mask

1476594219460415502	Came to Port Blair. Was tested positive for Covid. Shifted to 10 day quarantine. Now it turns to be Omicron. Now they are shifting me to hospital - unbelievable harassment. Who will take responsibility for any infections from hospitals.@PMOIndia @USAndIndia @UAEembassyIndia
1429098319603716099	I was supposed to spend my birthday today going to WWE Summerslam, but right before i boarded my flight, my covid test from this past week came back positive...so instead I will be spending my birthday in bed sleeping. Happy birthday to me
1377081849328115712	@Trapperdave7 Illegals in San Diego have in class teaching at the convention center while citizens of San Diego stay home. Pure insanity.  Oh did I mention 89 of them tested positive for Covid?
1379540893083000842	So I never post much on here but for those who don’t know Nick tested positive for COVID and is currently being treated in the hospital. For those of you who haven’t had to deal with it first hand, I hope you never do. For those of you who have gotten COVID and it wasn’t
1512105014705233920	@MooneyGerard Am I missing something here? Why would one contact the hospital “my team” because they’ve tested positive for Covid. 5 of us had C19 a mild cold with a cough I thought it was hay-fever. One member has a weak immune system, didn’t contact my GP never mind the hospital. All ok
1437732784710291460	@jdesmondharris I personally know 5 people who’ve died in the icu from Covid in the past 2 weeks and they were fully vaccinated. My fam has antibodies. Recently exposed &amp; we are only ones who didn’t get Covid. Antibodies work &amp; Gov can keep their vaccine. There’s my research.
1434221125316321282	@OscarDeLaHoya At first I didn't believe in covid 19 two weeks back I was diagnosed with Corona virus guys this thing is real when u eat all the food test the same even the drinks I thought I was moving to another world but with God grace I'm still here I thank god for that https://t.co/T37DgnKSWf
1429500511972208650	"This is such a stupid take. You want me to believe the increase in covid cases in states that don't border Mexico is because of immigrants? Who are, by the way, quarantined if they test positive. The ""border crisis"" is just something y'all made so you could be even more racist."
1372194320879616000	Join me in praying for Rose.She serves with our team in a really hard place. She had COVID last year. It was rough. She was vaccinated. She is in the hospital with it again. It’s a different vaccine than what is offered in the states. Pray for Rose.#pray
1378622786046812167	It's sad that you are tested positive for Covid-19 but i know you will recover very soon...Get Well Soon @akshaykumar ..#GetWellSoonAkshayKumar #coronavirus #AkshayKumar https://t.co/AGAYxxDjCt
1432239078674731008	@TonyHinton2016 @MailOnline So Covid put her in hospital 3 days after she got the covid jab? Does the DM think we are THAT stupid? What am I missing?
1378812326825111553	@Ghostless @Steve_Hallock2 @AnthonyDiComo Don't understand what's wrong. Maybe you can explain. I had covid last year, 8 days in ICU from Coney Island Hospital to USNS Comfort. My wife, a teacher in person at school all year doesn't want to get vaccinated. Her choice, as is Mike's.
1468084842223095809	@Conwell_TK Sick leave also important. Proof of positive test must be handed in to stay home. Im just guessing that it's for covid, so correct me if I'm wrong.
1508589319153401858	@nathaliejacoby1 Wasn’t diagnosed but looking back the month before COVID was declared (February 2019) I had what was similar to the flu, definitely worse than a cold. In hindsight, I think it was COVID.

An ER nurse told me he got COVID at 28, was in the ICU for a month, lost 25 pounds, and was still trying to get back his strength. Your attitude is concerning.
1475272646464094209	@AdamKinzinger Just a personal experience.. in my office of 10 people 5 of us are vaccinated with boosters 5 are not .. past 10 days covid came in .. no one vaccinated got sick .. the 5 not vaccinated 3 had mild to moderate.. 1 very sick at home .. 1 in hospital on oxygen and very sick ..
1484957297872977931	#COVIDIOTS #nhs100   #COVID  I didn't realise that when people said most unvaxed people end up in hospital that it meant you worked there . 70,000 unvaxed NHS employees, how come they are not all dead. Lol . Maybe they know a thing or two..
1506875569019166723	Very close to sending a fake positive covid test to my manager today.
1366629463333609475	"Offered an extra dose of Covid-19 vaccine to an acquaintance.  She declined - said she was ""on the fence"". Just got a text that she tested positive and my teen was exposed to her WHILE she was symptomatic!!! She ""thought"" it was allergies! #COVIDIOTS"
1476917028711710724	@adelebella12 @rick_pittman @kahnkidz … who did not get sick enough to end up in the hospital, but were sick enough at home, many who will end up with chronic sequelae of Covid, lasting months to years, like loss of smell, taste and lots more. May sound trivial to you, but it isn’t to those who suffer. I must say…
1428662875250384900	@BorisJohnson @MHRAgovuk Wow u actually mentioned it! Thought I'd entered some weird parallel universe where suddenly everyone including the government 4got covid overnight! Can u provide stats re how many in hospital with C are vaxxed? Or just u know.. speak to the people ur supposed to be in charge of!
1526160662119972866	@Cealdish my whole house tested positive for COVID yesterday 😖
1596616977912856576	@slackingoff3 @Cam_Knoll @Billybeeswife @t95764151 @ObeyYourMans But I've seen serious injuries in my small circle of people, which are way beyond what one would expect. Also, one was hospitalized with a bad case of covid.
1439522166521798659	@erintheboss @GladysB Zero people with covid or even a positive test. 2 people I know had severe adverse reactions to vax.
1375726862802939906	I wish I could send my boss the fucking bill since I got covid at work and that was the reason I had to go to the ER in the first place
1435287610008743958	The MAJORITY of people in my area of Northern NJ that have #Covid and are Hospitalized are almost all Vaccinated. My family has been in Home medical business for over 50 years and we deal with Every single hospital chain in NJ and NY. Anything else ‘They’ tell you is a lie
1425788173418962951	@Calamitous_Rex @briantylercohen @DemonswithR I’ve had Covid.Recovered in 3 days. Didn’t go to the hospital.I also never said I wouldn’t take the vaccine. But it’s a personal choice if you want to or not.

1475577676199038982	Coping with COVID loss: 'It's not just a topic; these are real people' https://t.co/ucc6So8aIc via @Yahoo So I don't see any mention of being vaccinated before they became ill and ended up in hospital. Just wondering putting our health care worker at risk and using hospital beds.
1429302170894016514	Not gonna lie there was at least 3 times I probably should’ve gone to the hospital or felt like I was actually going to die while I’ve had COVID. Lost 15lbs though 😪
1436985287473651717	@lindsay_1oo @matthewdmarsden I don’t hope death esp by Covid to anyone. Not even my enemies but I agree that health and life insurance premiums should be higher for those unvaxxed. They do it to smokers. The most sick are hospitalized, and are unvaxxed. They drive up the cost of HC.
1475629826362986501	@acalds9 @Breaking911 There's no one hospitalized in Florida because everyone died. I'm the last one. Say a prayer I'm about to die from Covid any
1441618087661371392	@kimKBaltimore Either we pay for them to get vaccinated or we pay for them to be hospitalized either way it’s the taxpayers burden. I just find it less sad that a covid denier leaves a family behind and begs for a go fund me
1478212341682491392	@McKaylaRoseJ @GenMedDoc How many kids have been hospitalized for Covid? How many hospitalized for the vaccine? Again, you can chose not to vax your kids (I’m not) without just making shit up. The data on kids getting mild Covid is strong. Very rare severe disease. That’s enough, no need to add BS.
1438182076709179400	risking putting more bacteria cells into my gut will just lead me back to the hospital to get attacks &amp; be abolutely useless in preventing me from covid https://t.co/8ARUstzYWI

1475686403690446856	Also another fun fact about my job took a call-in because someone has covid. The store has yet to inform anyone that someone tested positive😳
1462137027508506633	@darrylwolk I don't believe that there is anything to support that the vaccines are wearing off. The majority of those hospitalized and taking up ICU space continue to be unvaccinated. I have heard of 3 separate families in my circle this week that got COVID, all were unvaccinated.
1377634617759518732	I am just so angry and frustrated... and feeling pretty sad and hopeless. There is just no end in sight, it’s been 9 months in hospital and I’ve not even been able to leave the hospital grounds since October because of COVID.
1407555176660099072	@wildros02707941 @Psyop2020 Mine sent me a text stating I shouldn’t bother going anywhere near them as they were closing because of Covid. Supposedly they were drafted to work in the hospital. Supposedly.
1525218838056521728	"For those of us lucky enough to be relatively healthy, I think ""you're gonna get Covid once a year, but it won't put you in the hospital"" is a tolerable equilibrium, but ""you and your family are gonna get it 2-3 times a year"" isn't really..."

1595111172453568512	@KelleyKga To the quote from Cowling, I spoke with an ER physician around January 2021, and he said he had been treating huge surges of covid patients for the past several months, but not one person had tested positive for flu A or flu B, and he had tested them all.
1479052874063695874	@AnneLaird31 He also said it was right to lift restrictions on people entering the country as they are not the people being admitted to hospital. I wonder if he actual knows how all the different covid variants entered the UK?

1431597948991909894	This breaks my heart. And also makes me so angry at our utter lack of national resolve around COViD. The huge majority of COVID patients in ICU beds are not vaccinated. Their choice is crippling our healthcare system and killing people.
1442161033431429122	@LKinTX @RestingTwitFace @Simplybeautif71 @RealMattCouch That 5% I’m sure includes people who were admitted into hospital for unrelated issue, tested “positive” for Covid and magically became a “Covid hospitalization.”
1444677377351630855	@rah_is_raw @ClayTravis People died because big pharma wanted that poison in your body. If Drs had treated patients with HCQ or ivermectin we wouldn’t be in this situation. I was sick and tested positive for covid last year ,they sent me home and advised to take Tylenol in case of a headache- go figure
1425402990064713733	Just tested positive for covid, go me ✌🏻🤪
1433976907301806082	@NadirahShakoor Wow ridiculous!! I@ fully vaccinated and wear a mask all the time. I’ve been sick all week having tested positive for Covid last weekend.  My boys too. Not sure what’s wrong with people! Please be safe Nadirah!
1381031349079965698	Sorry to report but am recovering in the hospital - not COVID related -Just heart and stomach issues. Will try to catch up later if I missed any follows
1424894410987278336	@danno321s @PierreKory I wasn’t hospitalized but was ill and out of work for months from covid and have had long COVID for a year. Anecdotal but my D levels have been low for yrs (&gt;20). The hubs got it from me and was sick 3 days, and he has normal D levels.
1518683817506131971	I’m really sorry guys, there will be no stream tonight. I’ve unfortunately tested positive for #covid19 and its making me cough which won’t make for a great watching experience. I’ll keep posting clips to keep you entertained.#twitch #twitchtv @OwlRetweets
1475015225384472578	This was my baby girls first Christmas and also mine and my bf’s first Christmas without family. We unfortunately tested positive for Covid last Saturday. This year was definitely different but I’m thankful that me and my little family are okay ☺️
1556112798349807616	@Mattkazz @CommonSenseMD1 Okay, got it. So you’re not confused when people that have been fully vax’d can still die of covid and/or be hospitalized, contract and spread when that’s literally the entire reason for the vaccine to begin with? I want to see how you dodge this one, because that’s a BIG failure
1375060800105291778	You KNOW that you were exposed to someone who tested positive for covid and you're still not wearing your mask? I want nothing to do with your selfish ass.
1550161466501861378	So @POTUS tested positive for covid while being vaxxed and boosted. Tell me more about how it’s a “pandemic” of the Unvaxxed. Lol
1401987534553554949	@TeachMrReed As a nurse and minister... I was willing to take a chance with the vaccine vs. die alone in the hospital on a ventilator. I had COVID last fall. I was scared to death. I worked in a hospital early in the pandemic.
1475254562160263169	|| dear lord I tested positive for Covid and strep 🤦‍♀️
1453424600461856772	Gonna miss basketball practice tmrw and friday and might miss the tournament in the weekend if i test positive for covid. 😕
1471502176962813954	@BuckSexton I am vaccinated, got Covid at a hospital , went got Monoclonal infusion, so no I don’t wear a  mask.  I wore one the whole time in hospital, day and night, still got Covid.
1595463700064141312	@bdelahorne @ZubyMusic Because if you study the fatality rate of covid along the age groups, young people don't need it at all, especially the variants were already much benign when the Vax was out. I didn't take it and I never caught it even though I was sitting with those tested positive and coughing
1414334636172488708	@VincentRK I'm a healthy person with no comorbidities. Also I've already had it. Had I not tested positive, I wouldn't have known I was sick. My chances of dying from COVID are about as close to zero as one can get. I'm not anti-vax, but I'm in no hurry to get vaxed. This is reasonable.
1380030805657976839	My momma tested positive for Covid 🥺
1501211662136877062	my boyfriend who i spend 24 hours everyday with in our tiny house just tested positive for covid on a pcr but mine came back negative ,,,, honestly shout out to my immune system https://t.co/q4kf2PpVVJ
1384258885955985419	"@DrTomFrieden yah,  yah. we know.... all the ""front line workers"" and people in senior centers who came down with COVID after the ""vaccination"" or ""tested positive""  all coincidence.  I personally know a young girl who got the jab, got COVID.  Coincidence.  Yah."
1422372520045555714	@StevenTDennis Of course R's are maskless. Best of luck to them. I'm vaccinated yet still tested positive for COVID after visiting NC a month ago.
1374538825758867463	@rachelyafchak That’s amazing! I’m super sick with either a cold or covid. Got vaccinated Friday and was in the ER Saturday. They’re paying me for Fri, Saturday, and all the the day I’m out until my negative results. Plus unpaid days off if I need more time. Bout time some companies come thru
1473325440156712968	Today: I wore new shoes that have destroyed my feet, I got my booster and now my arm hurts, I got STUNG BY A BEE ON THE TUBE IN THE MIDDLE OF DECEMBER and had a reaction so my hand is swollen. And my roommate tested positive for COVID. 👋 2022 I’m ready for you now thx
1548024176094560257	One of the people I live with has tested positive for covid 🙃
1522310846696890369	i need to go get antibiotics for my throat but the walk in clinics around here won’t take me in because technically its a “covid symptom” so i have to go to the hospital 💀
1429940598430130180	@DAOBarry @REHPatients @MadeInBedlam No. Was not permitted due to covid restrictions. He was in hospital. I was at home.
1480234551867850759	@yumisinofficial I don't. My boss currently has covid and had to be admitted to the hospital because he got pneumonia 4 days ago. He is doing much better now that he was cared for.
1405360621575540739	@DrMichaelWald @swgoogs @CDCgov Exactly. I just found out today that I have covid, despite being vaccinated. As the person who informed me said, the vaccine did its job. It kept you from getting really sick or being hospitalized.” I’m grateful I’m vaccinated and not seriously ill.
1375897985662455814	My wife is in the ICU with COVID and pneumonia. She been there since Tuesday. Please, I need prayers. She is on a ventilator.
1479238060646797312	I just tested positive for COVID with an at home rapid test doing the throat swab before the nasal swab. My fiancé tested negative. I don’t understand how this is possible. I’m exhausted and scared. I already had strange health issues before this. I’m so tired. https://t.co/2Qe7I3AOVv
1485629496640241666	well, tested positive for covid and now i can't go to school 🙁
1597648779154714624	@EricMMatheny I recently had a respiratory virus and the first thing they asked in the er was if I had been vaccinated. I told them hell no. They said good because the covid vaccine would only have made matters worse.
1455863037534015494	@madmaximus88 @JVR926 Tried that. Zinc, Quercetin, C and D since March 2020. Covid attacks areas of inflammation in your body. It made my diverticulitis flare up. Landed in the hospital now for over a week. Was doing okay then two days ago oxygen tanked. I’m on oxygen. Pulse Ox is 90. I’m scared.
1387114389233311746	Also, getting Covid sucks even when you don’t go to the hospital/die. One day of feeling crappy after your 2nd shot (maybe) is better than that! Bonus: you won’t be vector of infection (I know, that’s caring about other people, gross)
1439974810038112264	@LaurieCJuarez @TrumpLostGetOv1 @AttainMonies @POTUS Those aren’t Covid dumbass. Only 250 hospitalized statewide due to Covid. Last I checked, 75% does not equal full.
1401381239945269249	@mikecapsalot209 Yeah i did go to the hospital. I just got out like 20 minutes ago. Found out i have pneumonia on top of covid now smh
1475268357339459585	Well, I've just been informed that I had second-hand contact with someone who tested positive for COVID, so... there's absolutely nothing keeping me from reviewing Gachimuchi Life Simulator! https://t.co/1W7Ah1FGhC
1433203813452853250	@goodblackdude Will he say the same for the 80% obese people that were the ones hospitalized that were preventable. What about those same people that account for the majority of heart disease deaths that are far more than Covid deaths. I’m trying to make it make sense.
1464864757819785218	@nadineratuita2 @hcolon59079762 @JackPosobiec I work with the military. 99.9% of soldiers who tested positive for covid had 0 symptoms. Only way to know was a test. Just an anecdotal story. And question why they suppressed DoD studies or never performed them.
1383989026844073987	Also if you know me you know I’m a Luke Bryan fan, but I just can’t make it make sense that last week he tested positive for Covid and now it’s cool he can go back to Idol after canceling the ACM’s because of said Covid? What? Huh? How? He’d still need to quarantine, right?
1476973510241230855	I hope the #CDC calls me and say that I tested positive for #Covid I could use 2 weeks away from my job WITH PAY !!
1352643477654417408	5. A positive COVID test following vaccination does NOT mean that the vaccine doesn’t work. It just means the data from clinical trials is being mirrored i.e. no vaccine has 100% efficacy. Hence precautionary measures are essential pre and post vaccination.
1428831508874371076	I just want to be bacc normal. I’m almost there but I got a ways to go. That Covid and pneumonia really fucced me up. On top of the week in the hospital. 🙏🏽
1376213620598702082	Can’t confirm 100% but I heard someone at that huge offline Japan tournament tested positive for Covid :/
1426595244078944257	@SteveBurke2000 @jemillerwbal Never vaccinated got covid was fine never had a feeling of covid  still here no why I take care of my immune system  I have natural  anti bodies  been around crowds of people never tested positive  again  thank God for our immune system
1480203310938349578	@Prof_Marciniak @rupert_pearse @NHSBartsHealth Like Stefan I am a Consultant &amp; Prof in Respiratory Medicine. I &amp; loved ones have been vaccinated. Because I *know* it is the single most important thing I can do to avoid being admitted to ICU or dying from COVID. And because it will protect those I care about most 💙
1378819676663336967	@leguape I know absolutely no one who has tested positive on a lateral flow test. No one. Not even people who had covid.
1465962755236581381	"@Klaatus_mate Of course, but that is not evidence, as you well know. I could make anything up and present it as fact, as you have just done. Give me a link to the article that says that  ""91% of all people who died in hospital of Covid in October were double jabbed"", or you are just full of BS"
1474613961769291777	@TravelerXander Hallo, here is your unroll: When I tested positive for COVID a few days ago, nowhere in my test… https://t.co/XNUbsHQRy8 Share this if you think it's interesting. 🤖
1341170615294828547	Mitch McConnell got a covid-19 vaccine before any of the healthcare providers I’ve worked with in the ER did.
1471348192029642753	hey uh why is it that today I’ve seen dozens of tweets and multiple tik tons asking why everyone in NYC got diagnosed with COVID today? the vibes are bad!
1435870379629813760	nah because what if they bring me to hospital and of course I'm gonna be admitted as a covid case and I won't be able to see matrix 4 trailer https://t.co/HDMxSYcXwu
1488875817874636801	Yesterday I tested positive for COVID 😥Thankfully I'm fully vaccinated and boosted.  I'm wearing 3 masks for the duration and my only symptom is a lack of critical thinking!
1387867692590407680	I’m still covid positive, but I’ve been told I’ll test this way for a bit and not to bother getting retested again because it’s just a waste of resources and doesn’t really matterAnyway I’m getting my first vaccine tomorrow
1460557804154998785	@cbseindia29 saying that they follow all COVID protocols during the examination than I want to ask one question to #CISCE &amp; @PMOIndia that If the doctors tested COVID positive who wearing the PPE kit Than small students was safe?😔 #DoTerm1Hybrid hlp us @NidhiTanejaa @anubha1812
1382142362558681089	@bstokley14 @KissnerRadio @thekidmcmanus @1043TheFan @9NEWS reported tonight a chart that showed positive test for COVID-19 are way down from this time last year. Vaccine is available for all. Only Bucs, Seahawks and Broncos have opted out. To me seems like a play from NFLPA in prep for new CBA and using pandemic as scapegoat
1354893815627317249	@Amykins_1 I have covid but thankfully it just feels like a really bad dose of the cold. My mum is in hospital with it but she is grand, she got her first dose of the vaccine which has stopped her getting it bad. She is actually a lot better than me and will hopefully get home soon
1504475982006157313	Finally tested positive for covid. Got worse last night. Def freaking out. My transplant clinic is under no sense of urgency too 😂   What timing with my anniversary this week. Guess I won’t be celebrating. https://t.co/jJQnULigY8
1548719092978266112	And the results of my #COVID test are in and I’m still positive. But I feel better!
1385231155620843528	@Hollay2 This is my stance as well. I don’t want anyone to be hospitalized or to die. But when I’m told there’s no such thing as Covid, my brain says, without my bidding, “maybe you need it to touch your life.”
1475929362977497095	@connolly_s I guess my first question would be how to reasonably verify?  I've gone to the hospital more than once this year and covid wards are a separate location from other functions the hospital provides NC.Not saying it's impossible to ctch covid at the hospital but is it even likely?
1508701628223864834	she was diagnosed... COVID I'LL GET YOU MYSELF
1528877871590416384	@LDLSkeptic @DominicDAgosti2 @tnseyfried @feinman235 @Pruvit_KetoOS I think it would be interesting to know ketone levels in people with regards to all newly diagnosed cancers...As well as outcomes from cancer treatments on a scale bounced against ketone levels in patients...Lastly, same for Covid hospitalizations...
1411676305590943749	@DigiThane I was tested Covid positive on Friday 2nd July at Sahyadri Antigen Center Kalwa. My family members were tested negative with Rapid test. There is no update on their RTPCR test. Archana / Sharayu / Shardul Patil. Please update.
1419701322899607552	@Finskifani @oldsoulmedia @zerohedge I don’t know a single person that has even been hospitalized for covid, but I know 2 people that have died from a reaction to the vaccine…
1381654538428407809	@GalSitty @EricMMatheny not all vaccines but the one for COVID I would not touch with a 10 foot pole. any known adverse reactions so far like perfectly healthy people who died after getting the shot? or been hospitalized? what about long term effects? why get the shot if you can still get it afterwards?
1336514082460102658	@adamhousley Participated in Moderna trial. Had minor reaction to 2nd injection. Curious after 30 days or so whether I got the “real thing”. Antibody test came back positive for IgG SARS COVID antibodies. Vaccine works and is benign. No one should hesitate to get this. #Warp Speed
1387395139358842881	@MSNBC let's talk about those who got vaccinated and still tested positive for Covid-19.  I'm positive 1 month from getting the J&amp;J.
1476570588051296256	@KdotTeague They told me about the penicillin shot if my test comes back to to strep .. but it was positive for covid.. so they just sent me home with amoxicillin for my ear and some Tylenol with codeine .. I really wanted that penicillin shot..
1421975114430697474	Well peeps. Got home safely, to be told by Stepdaughter she has done a lateral flow test and tested positive!Lisa &amp; I are doing a test now!Going to post a video tomorrow about COVID &amp; all the conspiracy theories &amp; people believing it doesnt exist!😡😡😡
1398676728902565894	@CharlotteOFlan1 @Laney1987 @Elliemaexx__ @PoliticsForAlI @theipaper What were your chances of getting very sick, being hospitalized or being permanently disabled with long Covid? That is surely what is important. On that basis I would much rather take my chances with the vaccine than with Covid.https://t.co/DgBC1Oe7MR
1454088748631797763	@kalegrandify @seanhelaosouse I felt a little “off” for about a day. Arm sore.But way less than the first 2.No biggie.And I’ll do it again as soon as it’s needed.No intention of being hospitalized, intubated, long term covid, or dead.
1556013342707384321	@RuhoyMD I was diagnosed with Chiari malformation (most likely acquired) a year after my initial Covid infection.
1550144639855775744	@DonnaAncestor @JenniferShutt Just great- I assume! She wasn’t hospitalized, isn’t dead &amp; doesn’t have Long Covid…worked out great!
1473763388518019082	@MctagueNicole @MichaelPSenger Another scam. Regular COVID PCR test yields virus positive after at least 3 primer pairs detect 3 viral genes. I have heard that now if 2 primer pairs detect 2 viral genes then they call it Omicron or whatever.
1519297271950684160	@catturd2 @maryman31794828 Good morning, Carter’s! I hope your better. I’m not in hospital but I’m stuck at home with covid.
1466471078998552579	i tested positive for covid ... ugh
1427427346072678406	@RWMaloneMD Whats your position on ppl who already had covid? Wife and i both had it early dec last year. She was hospitalized, i was not. It was like mild bronchitis w me. She had lung cancer and left lung partially removed. She got steroids and remdesivir, felt better in one day
1471580992653697029	@Teresa_Peckham @nw_nicholas Hey that’s fine. I didn’t need the hospital, just like millions of people with Covid. In fact, most of the hospitalized are Medicare recipients, which one receives for paying taxes all those years. Kick the elderly while they’re down!
1484076513112862726	@CrispianWheldon @73tonilou Like I said they mean nothing unless the result is hospitalisation or death. If people have covid and are at home self managing that’s a good thing no? Means that they aren’t unwell enough to go to hospital.
1587672531259035648	Never have i ever tested positive for Covid
1422882766228639744	"@kksheld @CDCgov @NIH I agree...especially with the early treatment.....seems most Drs tell covid patients ""Stay home and go to the ER if you can't breathe""!"
1477603365127274496	So Brock Lesnar is the WWE Champion for the 6th time. I wanted Kevin Owens to win because he has never been the champion. The news was surprising that Roman Reigns tested positive for COVID and fatal 4 way for the WWE Championship became fatal 5 way.
1441185619829407755	@TViewfromhere @MichelleMag21 @CBCAlerts Please share your source of information? I have had anaphylaxis from a previous vaccination which combined with the rest of my medical history  is one of the reasons my Doctor has referred me to Hospital regarding the covid vaccine is that not  an adverse reaction?
1488173782971957251	@MandyandRic I tested positive for Covid last week! Very sad not to have been able to perform! Hope you enjoyed x
1432503043774418945	i am so terrified about covid rn. i know so many ppl, even ppl my age, getting hospitalized with covid and i live in shithole florida so mask mandates are literally BANNED and even if they werent no one would follow them 😐 pls just let us go back to online school
1431238324098904069	@BillyForza @zerohedge I tested positive for covid in November of 2020 (I now think I had delta variant) and just got antibody tested two days ago and came back positive for antibodies. Different for every which person but you can do the math.
1540708683822542848	@jen_pic Show me where a Medic was told to fill the underlying cause as covid19 simply because the patient tested positive to covid.I'll wait.
1462914735284928528	Within the past week, I've had two students test positive for Covid-19 who were fully vaccinated and got their booster shots. One has lost their smell and taste. Covid is not a joke.
1434944438011301889	@JamesMelville The lengths they go to to minimise bed occupancy for non covid is also insane. I had a very major op, prior to covid I would have been in hospital for at least three nights. Now the ward shuts at night and they send you home. I was home after 4 hours! No proper care at all..
1361017534724460544	@RinoRooter @JKash000 Yes, and contrary to how they deal with Covid deaths. Someone does due to heart disease or stroke BUT tested positive for Covid, it is gets counted as a Covid death. I am sure they have their orders to help ensure public confidence in vaccine.
1531233418578632706	SOMEONE HELP IM HAVING A COUGHING FIT IN THE HOSPITAL EVERYONES GONNA THINK I HAVE COVID
1469290736743075848	I’ve heard so many people showing raw data on COVID-19 to argue that vaccines don’t work. These data show age specific differences in risk of ending up in hospital. They can’t prove vaccines work but I know which group I’d like to be in - the vaccinated have many times less risk. https://t.co/ViDFNYSc5H
1483334662235869192	@SpaceDadCthulhu @hannahrose777 @ConSelfOwns I dont know about hospitals being filled up but if they are bring filled by covid patients I'd imagine that they're filled by the unvaccinated. Several states put out data on covid cases hospitalizations and deaths. Vaccinated are just less likely to go to the hospital for covid.
1480836702738411521	@davehendo69 @LyneSanderson No, but I’m more afraid you may get Covid from me (I may have it but not know it because it’s a mild case) and you have to go to hospital and burden and already overworked RN!
1436961638331129857	Love being told you can’t take time off work unless you have a positive covid test to then dragging myself to work with no voice, a cough and temperature, to then being told I can’t be there 🙃 The only plus is that I managed to get a PCR test before work.
1431063000400728064	My Hospitalist colleague admitted a 30 year old with covid hypoxia. She was in ivermectin prescribed by a clinic/urgent care doc. That clinic provider told her don’t g to the hospital because she’s die.Admit sats were 70%
1379414369612787713	FWIW I did test positive for Covid in November but I know people have been asking questions.
1617378869195034625	every single day since I tested positive for covid, someone asks me if I am done having covid or when I will be done. no yeah I’m feeling great thanks for fuckin asking
1434933401597972490	@minakimes I’m conflicted. I’m pro-vax. Part of me thinks if you are vaxxed in the NFL you should be tested, for tracing purposes, but still be allowed to play. If all players are vaxxed, their likely not to be hospitalized.   Looks like Covid is here to stay. What do you think, Mina?

1484861951658409985	Testresult from the COVID PCR test came back positive. 4 days after my 17 yo tested positive. No loss of taste or smell so it looks like the Omicron variant. Activated the “sick” profile on my tandem pump. #T1D https://t.co/SbDXlZgfoz
1425501913609502720	@Ionesco_Rhino @sleepywhiner @JustinWolfers I’ve worked in ICU and been a part of how to decide who gets a bed when there aren’t enough beds. It happens all the time. Triage is a thing already. Adding Covid to the triage list may have Covid patients not meeting the criteria for the particular ICU in that particular moment
1372612276474183687	"@JDS_Canadian I'm living proof about the hospitals NOT being overwhelmed. When I was in the hospital (Dec), I was the only person in Emergency for 3 hours.

1377082419908538371	@anet2111 I’ve intubated and put lines in dying covid patients. The most difficult part of covid for me hasn’t been in the hospital. It’s been going out and seeing people just not care or even try. Ugh. 😒
1518388537988554752	@steenslaytonatr It doesn't matter. Number of graph still the same information. Unfortunately we never get back to 0 cases, it is quite unrealistic, my opinion I will report only cases with covid in hospital or ICU.
1442759028321529859	@Warzoid @doctor_oxford @BBCPanorama Who will feel safe going into hospital if they do this? I'm severely immo compromised due to stage 4 cancer and ongoing oral chemo. I have to go regularly for my treatment and blood tests I will not feel safe if they relax covid rules &amp; know many others who will also be worried
1387701643710451712	I don't know why everyone is giving Kate stick!If one of your loved ones were in hospital with Covid, you wouldn't like it if I took the piss out of that, would you?But I don't because I have my limits - and so should you#ThisMorning
1388226177941217280	i just got tested positive for covid
1488439784418721792	@nikkilincoln I agree with not isolating on an exposure until symptoms develop/positive test, but once you know, you should absolutely stay away from other people. This counts for any illness, not just Covid. Common sense and decency.
1511257191692574723	It’s now the second time I’ve tested positive for #COVID. I hope this isn’t going to happen every six months 😩🤦🏻‍♂️
1531258141366796289	@Nicol_a_th When he was first elected, although not my choice I gave him the benefit of the doubt, when the country first went into lockdown, I thought OK, he’s doing it for the greater good, when he got covid and ended up in hospital I felt sorry for him… now in hindsight,is it any wonder?
1453455592576663567	Even though I have had 3 COVID 19 vaccine jabs (no COVID booster) and a flu jab I still ended up being in hospital with the seasonal flu on Tuesday morning.Still not feeling great.The only thing that's stops me is the seasonal flu.
1424785255240769539	I'm seeing a crap ton of people posting about kids being sent to the hospital with COVID...do they know it's COVID or are folks just assuming?  Because according to the news, it's most likely RSV.  But you know everything is COVID these days.    https://t.co/JxMZ12vsf7
1408814835438034948	@PnMuntergk @GovEvers @SenRonJohnson Let me ask you a question.  If you come down with COVID and are sitting at home determining how to treat yourself are you aware of treatment or do you just wait until you become so sick that you go to the hospital?
1384879801010429954	@roolbritannia @Freedom36044178 @SammyVMc86 @mmpadellan Well were not in the UK and then why would you take the risk. Do you know how many under age 18 have had covid in the U.S. and been hospitalized and spread it unknowingly because they were A symptomatic? I know six 2 who were hospitalized 1 age 3 and 4 who tested for antibodies.
1474166128448577537	lol I tested positive for covid today
1339669048129429504	So today I got my first dose of the COVID vaccine. So far I feel fine. Not going to debate this, I saw so much working in ER dealing w/ COVID patients, that this needed to be done. But so far so good. Can keep ya’ll updated if you like. God Bless
1374444519647633408	@StigAbell The under 50s are not vaccinated. They still get the virus . They still get life changing long covid and they still get rushed to hospital gasping for breath. They might not die. But casually saying it doesn't  matter  tells me the media haven't learnt the lesson of the last year
1380441944199938059	@JeremyVineOn5 tested positive.  Everything is due to Covid I am told.  We cannot come out of lockdown like before and I just wish people would stop and think.
1400125321781862405	I had flue a few weeks ago, an ignorant colleague of mine decided to sip on my left over soup and now she tested positive for Covid 19. Here I am asking myself if I had Covid or vele it was flue. Le virus is making us overthink mayiphele https://t.co/OVfrjO7OEb
1552750440802033664	@TheCovidKid3 🚨🕸️When Donald Trump got the COVID he had to be hospitalized and almost died.When Joe Biden got the COVID he just had the sniffles.I guess vaccines really do work.#JoeBiden #COVID19 #VaccinesWork https://t.co/W4EDcgJU5p
1479347353999994880	I'm convinced I have the antibodies for covid at this point I've literally had several close contacts + shared drinks by accident w/ positive cases yet still negative with every kind of test taken 🥲
1440761362225897472	My grandaunt is an RN. She said the vaccine was going to kill ppl. Her husband just died after being in the ICU from COVID with COPD…plz stop listening to nurses. We are barely qualified to know shit. We just clean shit, take blood, &amp; give shots. No nurse knows anything.
1429252892557406209	@MeyerB @FoxNews My spouse is an ICU nurse. He has had several patients lately from covid. All the ones who died or are in the hospital longer are NOT vaccinated. He’s had one vaccinated patient and she was released within days of her diagnosis.
1503482221759447046	@DianneM94036771 @PMT2387 @MarylouCulkar6 @CourtTV until Covid I had never seen Fentanyl used for pain relief in the ICU setting - Morphine, Hydromorphone, and Meperidine were always the main 3 opioids used - it has been used for years in the OR setting as a induction med along w/Propofol - but u r being ventilated
1596918943637467138	@ProudElephantUS NO … an that’s because in ICU during the pandemic!! no one wore one not a single soul on the covid wards NO one wore them  i can say this because i was there i sore it with all my family !!
1400484173245083653	@greatesteverMD @crystal_vase Yeah, I'm just relaying what she said. She got her first vaccine shot &amp; a week or so later got sick. So many servers/staff members got sick, they had to close the restaurant and then they all tested positive for covid.
1432683767324360706	@PMurany @SiWOism I live in a small town. Nobody in my town has died from covid. We have 4 “mysterious deaths” that happened within 2 weeks of the person getting the vaccine. All 4 deaths were caused by blood clots. We have a woman in hospital who is about to be our 5th vaccine death.
1427824929127415809	@Matthew_4_Trump I’ve encountered 3 people who tested positive for Covid 19. 2 seemed to have a flu and 1 with entire family where fine?  It’s BS
1377761287388602369	I tested positive for covid on fucking April Fools Day.I...hahahaha I’m not even mad. This has been par for the course with my fucking life the past year.
1502544844933132288	speedy recovery for dew my baby. i got tested positive for covid last month and it was hell. i hope it won’t be that bad for him :(
1503121003374804995	"A few minutes ago, a lady behind me in line at the grocery store told me it was ridiculous that I'm still wearing a mask. I lifted the mask from my face, leaned in towards her,and said, ""Yeah, but I tested positive for covid yesterday. """
1340897477843673089	@Big2News Hey BIG2, I see you copied and pasted another poorly researched AP News article with a misleading headline.  At my employer we were told that a contraindication for receiving the vaccine was a positive COVID-19 test within the past 90 days, which President Trump has had.
1460731226738860032	@returningfromt2 @DaveAtherton20 @sajidjavid @NHS Good question. Number 1 place to catch Covid in Hampshire (where I live) was in hospital
1524777092948316164	@DrTomFrieden I definitely agree.  I just received my 4th shot this morning. #Moderna.  So far I have not tested POSITIVE for Covid-19.  i I never Stop wearing my Mask; especially in Public. I rather be Safe than SICK.
1537895147861487616	@_ashawndabney I have never been sick nor tested positive with Covid.  I got the vaccine &amp; several boosters.(knock on wood)
1433746347602100228	Doesn't really feel all that long ago I had quite a few people in mentions arguing anti-lockdowns protesters shouldn't be given access to ICU if they got COVID19. Hopefully everyone that recognises the filthy calculus of the clip above can do the same for that.
1431577050008195080	@juno8448 @cabezaderubik @PeterSweden7 I had Covid also, no vax, never knew I had it until out of curiosity I went and got an antibody test. I tested positive for the antibodies. I had ZERO symptoms.
1587866074606862344	@MeddygLou Thank you for informative thread,👏👏👏 Never diagnosed with COVID but really ill Xmas 2019. GP didn’t know what it was, prescribed steroids. Had  3Pfizer Vax, now Cranial fluid leaking from my brain to behind my left eye &amp; Tinnitus.Do you think maybe vaccine or COVID related?
1427319525356150799	Oh yeah I met with my psych a few days ago and I think she thought I was in the hospital for COVID so she doesn't need to know I was in the looney bin
1474087086185754630	Tested positive for covid the other day.. I didn’t think the world needed to know right then and there. Nor did I have to post how sick I was and what’s been going on.. people are sooo weird.. they do any and everything for clout.
1487585546230800397	Canceled my @Spotify account today thinking of a comrade and fellow immunocompromised person admitted to the hospital yesterday with covid complications.
1479885116352643075	@hansen_jn @juliaioffe I am not vaccinated. Tested positive for Covid-19 on 4 December. Had a small headache for 2 days and side pain and that was it. How do u explain it?
1459506376095457290	@steviejobsworth @Rich_Dcn @mattletiss7 I'm glad you said that. Do you have any recollection of the esteemed Patrick Vallance stating in a press conference that people were lying in the hospital morgue with covid on the death cert that hadn't even been tested?
1459403674468241409	I know multiple Greeks with covid at the moment, in ICU or recovering at home, all unvaccinated, and it’s @NeosKosmos contributing to it happening
1520117414402297856	Some news: Giants PA announcer @RenelSFVoyce and her husband, Tommie, have tested positive for Covid and she'll miss the weekend series. She says they are asymptomatic, double vaccinated+boosted. Asked me to pass along her gratitude to Giants fans for their unwavering support.
1454700605516103684	@UnionBankTweets the site your shared doesn't work as my account become dormant because during Corona period I was in ICU for long time and could not oprate my account. Bank is not paying me my money
1428470121966747650	Doctor at clinic where we got 13yo's COVID test this afternoon: We are seeing a TON of kids come through here. A TON.Me: To get tested, or testing positive?Doctor: Testing positive. There are so many. I don't see how things can keep going like this.
1429985927317790729	my landlord tested positive for covid 😍
1468502166759518211	@SkyNews I wonder what time it will be announced Johnson’s self isolating cos he’s been near someone who tested positive for covid.
1387478643300044806	@AAPSonline @misterchambo I’m absolutely convinced that taking 2000iu of vitamin D a day significant ly reduce my chance of contracting COVID. Tested 2x never had a positive test, traveled on planes and stayed at hotels. This country is turning into sheep....🤦‍♂️
1480002465055473664	@GirlVet1975 @AmericanDansk @TimHannan My symptoms were mostly gastrointestinal and I did test positive for covid. Less typical presentation but it does happen.
1368173766438752258	@HeritageScrapbo @9NewsSyd https://t.co/dZB7ROt4wm And I know more than one person first hand who after a few weeks of their second dose of the vaccine still contracted covid and ended up in hospital. And you want don't believe the Nazis experimented on people without consent ? - look up the Nuremberg Code
1476515386338254859	@Lukewearechange I have had both vaccines and a booster but after flying in from LA ( I tested negative the morning I left) but I then tested positive for Covid on arrival at Heathrow where I took a PCR test and before those results came through I took this lateral flow test as I was unwell. https://t.co/jmG4nAEcm1
1434167408290238475	@jefffuturi Gah, I’m sorry you’re sick. Going to the hospital only makes healthy people sick. Maybe call your physician and let them know what’s going on. They won’t advise you to come in for a covid test unless your respiratory symptoms get much worse.
1488291449074589696	@Morcia We've got about 7 or 8 at work, that have constantly been off with covid, either tested positive or waiting for test results or come in to contact with someone who tested positive, more than I've been off sick my entire working life, idle bastards.
1587849319603851265	@Jumpmasterpsg Unfortunately. I tested positive for covid twice now.
1476153802625413120	@JohnWest_JAWS @BorisJohnson @Jacob_Rees_Mogg It doesn’t answer your question as I don’t know the UK numbers but in Ireland, last I heard, 67% of those in ICU with COVID-19 were deemed unvaccinated. 57% had no doses at all. 10% only had 1 dose. All were adults. Around 94% of adults in Ireland are vaccinated.
1515042715691540489	Short story: we got covid.10 days ago when I was having really dirty migraines, my partner took a couple RATs and said they were negative.Today, she showed me the test: faint but clear positive line.We have been wildly careful. We both wear N95 or better 1/
1401621933150593042	@FelipeMurrelli @RyanAFournier In some isolated locations Ivermectin is used,Houston fir instance, but it depends on individual doctors. Biden is firmly on the side of Pharma. I just learned that Peru, India and Mexico sent out Ivermectin to citizens who tested positive for COVID19
1443731319591092228	@lwoodhouse I am referring to the hospitalizations and deaths caused by Covid, not cases. Well over 90% of the hospitalized and deaths are occurring among the unvaccinated. So, to frame the article that the vaccines do not prevent infections...is false and implies they are not worth taking.
1520035611679338496	I’m no scientist, nor will I (or should Fauci) pretend to be, but riddle me this: How do you see positive Covid cases in TN decrease drastically, yet also see the fatality rate increase for those who do test positive (vaxxed or not)?? @kayleighmcenany @JoeConchaTV @RealCandaceO https://t.co/3l1A4u2MoF
1478677421138214912	@NancyKnowsLife (3/)The cost is more than Ppl make in a year for a month-so I fight now to get them to find a lower cost to save kids newly diagnosed…but Covid has set everything back…Sorry to go on…I was at doctors all day-Oh Nancy, the most healing thing is someone holding your hand &amp; ❤️-
1482751221631012865	@NotFun22 @ThatAngelGuy Sorry, no selfie. My 7 year old and I just tested positive for covid this morning and I feel like crap. This would be a wonderful win to help cheer me up. The best you get today is a bitmoji. https://t.co/zMhJY9nbk0
1377797981018144773	@nellastu1 @KATVNews Cases mean nothing. Someone tested positive, so what? Did they have any symptoms at all? Who knows? What we do know is that kids aren’t dying from Covid and that’s fact. I’m sorry that upsets you liberals so much but it’s the best thing about this virus, it barely affects kids.
1380551543938818048	@CNN This company is the reason why I now tested positive for COVID19. Lack of good safety procedures to ensure workers putting their own well being to make sure people get their products. And the workers are afraid to vote for their financial improvement? Dumb uneducated people.
1456535320367964161	@Chrismark94 @ptexo0 @lthomasnews All your posts are anecdotes. I'm double vaxxed, had no side effects, nobody I know had severe side effects. But I do know unvaxxed people in their 20s who've been hospitalised with covid.I've been in close contact with people who've later tested positive
1552430975900348417	@RetroSho Last year, when I didn't have covid, I ended up in the hospital from heat exhaustion... lol, like, dude... this is crazy.
1476622513216102406	I’m gonna spend NYE confined in my room and have dinner by myself because this girl got tested positive for covid today yay🙃🙃🙃
1387187073895989252	@SecondGentleman @DouglasEmhoff Experiencing Covid. Yes, I wasn’t so sick I had to go into the hospital, but I was sick enough to know I never wanted to experience that again.
1379553583960571909	Seriously man, this is ridiculous. All other 5 people in my household have now tested positive for Covid so I just had to go for my THIRD test in the last 2 weeks 🙄
1577726493815209985	LMAOOO I made like the same joke when stayc tested positive for Covid before kcon concert💀💀 https://t.co/Gw9oDig1P7
1373650361047781381	Went to the shop for mum's paper. Woman who works there said she's not getting the vaccine 'cos of how many people have died or got blood clots afterwards. Her husband is a paramedic &amp; has had covid. He was in hospital for weeks. Words fail me
1436412139930062849	@JasonEGuinn1 @F1Guldhammer @StephenKing I've spoken to half a dozen ER doctors and they all say the same thing. The vaccine is very effective at preventing severe COVID symptoms. About 90 percent of people hospitalized for COVID are unvaccinated.
1338851273899171840	@d1879 @Anaridis As someone who lost a family member to COVID -- in the ICU -- I'm fucking delighted for these health care workers, enthused by their joy, and thrilled that fewer people will die thanks to this vaccine and their wonderful care. https://t.co/oyuLv2LzYV
1540442205416030209	@Bob_Bahoomba I also tested positive for covid today. It's just a shitty day. Let's be mad today and then refocus tomorrow.
1478523626852950021	"@HillTVLive @robbysoave My Covid test came back positive today. Very mild symptoms, likely because I'm boosted.  I just had a lady tell me that I ""deserve it and all that comes with it"" because I ate at a restaurant on NYE.  F her and anyone who thinks shaming is ok."
1471213206064484368	I think adding D’Ernest Johnson is fine just from a handcuffing standpoint, but Nick Chubb tested positive for COVID last month. He’s in the 90 day window of no testing (unless I’ve got this wrong given the outbreak). If you’ve got Chubb, don’t be nervous. Highly likely he goes.
1418003064343121923	2021 has tested positive for Covid and will spend the rest of the year social-distancing from me.
1381373270721761292	@rayezorbak @benshapiro It is a smaller hospital and not every person in the hospital is due to covid. Surgeries have picked up but so have covid cases and summer injuries. Anyone going in will have to wait.  Omaha and surrounding counties have the majority of hospitals which is where my wife is...
1478411360086155268	Spent 7 months in 2020 working through the peak of covid as a carer, avoid catching it for 2 years, low and behold as soon as im about to start my 3rd term back at college, i test positive. Good effort.
1433074836348317699	My finger is still sore and bruised as fuck and now I'm a close contact of someone who's tested positive for covid having a great week 🤣😭
1376593947607379974	I learned today that a fully vaccinated nursing home resident tested positive for COVID-19.
1457611799960956932	@Daniel_sito90 @GarrettKnight17 @makenossense covid was never real to begin with. It only exists via a faulty diagnostic test. I've never been tested, never worn a mask anywhere, and I never will do either one. next person who tries to make me ends up hospitalized.
1469044121448947714	@patriotnot45 @MarshaBlackburn 1) First of all the deaths numbers published are extremely high, like I have mentioned those tested positive for COVID post death regardless of cause were a COVID death, no one knows the real number, you have suicides and automobile death included in that number...
1479428650051198981	The day after I posted about making up for lost time I tested positive for covid. The irony is not lost on me https://t.co/LAglmfK5bj
1375996337750208514	Covid PTSD is real. Things like medication, seeing or hearing of people in hospital, the phone ringing...all are triggers for people who have lost loved ones in medical facilities and/or who are recovering from covid. I don't know if we could ever measure the psychological damage
1417290125357338624	@christianhgross @TheJokstr @DejoTalisa @CTVNews Actually, yes.  I don't think you know how many more people are in hospital other than covid patients.  How many cancer screenings have been missed because of lockdowns for something most people fully recover from in 2-4 weeks?  Is that the same for cancer? No.
1399195120835117061	@AlishaAkhani Great thread doc and kudos to you for creating awareness in the society for vaccination.Just to add I got vaccinated with covishield, been doing covid ICU duties since. Once got mild symptoms. Most patients in ICU are non vaccinated. That in itself tells u that vaccines work.
1481302498312925185	my covid test was negative but I'm literally sick in a house full of people that tested positive so idk why it was negative
1373292703329439744	@SheaSerrano Hey man, I tested positive for covid Thursday. now have to miss the next 9 days of work.  Im currently $150 short of my upcoming rent.

1393567342882398212	@hands_space @bbdbbc2 @rejectthegreat1 I know it's scary, but it's the only thing that makes sense, we have 100 people in hospital with covid and 5 million locked down.... everyone thinks the public health experts are going to make them immortal😅
1445222979198013441	@AHS_media I'm confused now, are the unjabbed nurses who will soon be fired a threat to the mostly unjabbed covid patients in hospital? Or is it the 25% or so jabbed patients in hospital who are a threat to the unjabbed nurses? https://t.co/CJ8WoPJicO
1382315996212436994	@hughhewitt 2/2 many of these VAX weren’t even tested in animals OR PPL I had COVID19 in hospital with pneumonia with morbidities.  Quit the fear tactics on your show- lots more going on - lagging VAERS reporting of adverse effects
1481775528986267653	"@TromboneDonald @MarkMcGowanMP I cant remember any ""covid "" deaths. My point is the manipulation of statistics by changing the status of the double jabbed. He is already talking about all the people in ICU, being unvaccinated. Even if all the people in ICU were double jabbed, they would now be reclassified."
1452840894927884291	@kerpen I had Covid in January. My doctor told me to go straight to the ER for the antibodies since I have several risk factors. They took me right in, gave me the IV, sent me home. Didn’t cost me a dime. I would think all doctors were aware at the time if mine was.
1375256290881122306	1 year ago today I was diagnosed with Covid.It was day 12 in isolation when my fever spiked. I lost my sense of smell for 7 weeks, my wife was 8 weeks pregnant, and the news kept telling me ‘even if you feel better you may still drop dead in week 2’ - it was beyond stressful.
1595649855506219008	i can't believe my immune system failed the test i gave it. i literally walked around in the icu surrounded by covid patients and had to touch them and breathe near them to get chest xrays and i didn't get sick. masks really do prevent infection huh
1482873472523067396	@James_Unger @zappa3rd @FurdTurgeson1 @ErynHuff @_evelynrae I had a pre-existing heart condition. So once my Covid was cleared they did tests to make sure everything with my heart was fine as a precautionary. And This was 5 months before my vaccine, where I was hospitalized only two days after getting my jab.

1391878306111397890	@hannahlea @BenjaminBoo1 @lizzyj313 @kerrywashington I had covid on Halloween. Tested positive for antibodies 2 months later. Studies of those infected from SARs in 2004 have immunity against that strain as well as the current virus - 17 years later. There is no benefit for me to be vaccinated. Essentially zero risk of reinfection.

1441033051388080128	@neontaster The closest stats I've been able to find:The vaxxed are: - 3x less likely to catch COVID.- 3.7x less likely to be hospitalized.- 11x more likely to survive.
1374356221013196800	@kurtsiegelin I would imagine if fully vaccinated people are still getting covid and having to hospitalized it would be big news. I'd love to know how long these people are in the hospital for, are most being treated for a couple days and being released?
1389966219705466883	@wheezylouse Although saying that I know someone whose other half spent 8weeks in ICU and nearly died turn into Covid denier..
1477840098976620544	@phoebwill @polioandme The “with Covid, not due to Covid” distinction hides too many considerations. I get it is intended to say Covid per se not sending kids to hospital at the rate of in hospital. But unless “having” Covid is totally minimized, it underplays unknowns, long terms &amp; lived experience.
1418657092345503748	@SteveSchmidtSES Steve I 100% agree. I’m in Florida vacationing and no one I mean no one is wearing masks inside businesses. I also went to visit someone in the hospital and there were 3 cases in the ER with Covid.
1316711712138108929	@XxRochellexX @HoneyBVonnie I had a flu vaccine today though, that's the difference. I know the vaccine doesn't cover all strains. But also I don't know anyone personally that has gone in to hospital or died of flu (touch wood that stays the case). But I know people in hospital with covid.
1378024568481271811	Hagel played last night, then was placed in COVID protocol this morning. The team is still on the ice for practice today, 13 hours after the game. Makes me think Hagel's protocol reason was possibly not for a positive test, but maybe for contact tracing. Who knows?#Blackhawks
1386952988334432257	I tested positive for covid last week and I’m getting tested again later today, hopefully I’m negative and if I am, I’m gonna lay and hug the grass. And a tree
1476518169149796353	@simondjgibbs @drkerrynphelps Just going through an acute asthma attack, spoken to my respiratory nurse, who asked me to get a PCA COVID test today in case I have to go to hospital. I was lucky only waited an hour. Results in for 48-72 hrs. I think I will be In hospital before I get the results. Scary.
1456342297621192709	@SteveLaFrance2 @Timcast Valid point. To preface my next comment just to be clear I don't believe in any covid restrictions at all, but the covid tests are useless. Hardly ever work correctly. If you're positive it often says negative even if you test 3 or 4 times.If you're negative it's assumed positive
1374737791716843521	@Meidas_Kelly Hope you're better...Our line of work is definitely hazardous, even w/o Covid.My worst injury: being bitten on finger to bone  by senior citizen; this was before the fear of AIDS.And now I'm that senior who spent a month in hospital, septic, extubating self &amp; being..just lost

1416098805762727948	I stayed in Katsina State for 12 more days and the measles kept getting worse.I couldn't go to the hospital because those people might say I had corona virus. But I took many medical things that never worked.

1386127701644222471	@MJFrizzle Yes I’ve heard of that too not sure if ppl who haven’t tested positive for Covid have some symptoms from either vaccine 💉
1524637601415708674	@mominbayarea Also worth noting that the tests test positive if you have 1 of 50+ viruses, so you likely don’t have Covid. Who’s testing anymore??I’ve had 1 test since all this shite begin (enforced as I went to hospital).
1512109105778941959	@Richard_Harambe My money is on this WH never admitting Biden tested positive for COVID unless he required hospitalization or worse.Then they wouldn't really have a choice.
1353830748407689216	Let me get this straight; if people die within 28 days of a positive Covid test; it has to be because of Covid. So why doesn’t that logic also apply if someone dies within days of getting a Covid vaccine? https://t.co/q8X45JpLph
1386052772609597443	@wedusport  I heard how surprised you all were that a member of the UAE Team tested positive for Covid. Yes, you did say it was a false +. But here is the thing... no one should be surprised by a positive test even with the vaccine. The vaccine will not keep you from covid.

1516319059683405826	Oh forgot to mentioned but yesterday's covid test, I was negative 🎉The whole reason why i took it was actually because mama yumemiru got positive and i had symptoms but thankfully it was just the normal fever and coughs. Recovering slowly with coughs here and there~✨

1344474902930210821	Ok. So I got my vaccine. To test the system, I tried to schedule Covid test in OC and LA. There are no open slots. What should the people do? Die waiting in the ER? California is a failed system. People are dying because the state has failed to fulfill it duties.
1480881915053981696	@Yolo304741 My local hospital said 100% of those hospitalized for Covid are unvaccinated.

1524237402335850498	I just tested positive for COVID-19. I’ve only had a light cough and some annoying body aches over the last day, but other than that, I feel perfectly fine. Forever grateful to the vaccine - if you haven’t already, I really encourage you to get it.
1373746042466865152	It happened.I was notified that I was in contact with someone who tested positive for covid at work. I'm so so so grateful I'm fully vaccinated and have been double masking. Stay safe out there yall. 😷
1471907516804075522	I'm so sore after getting my booster.... But you know what I'm not? Dead. On a ventilator. In the ICU. Experiencing multiple organ failure. Feeling the brain fog of long term COVID induced aphasia. It's a good bargain.

1471997667710586880	Tested positive for COVID— while double vaxxed +booster shot. What it feels like? Like hit by a train. “Mild symptoms” are not that mild. Take your booster pls — coz I’m wondering if this is mild, I don’t want to know what’s not! #OmicronVarient
1433172106171215874	@DreifussMD @choo_ek @Right2SafeAz Thank you for all you do. I believe anyone who chooses not to get vaccinated should not go to the hospital if they get COVID.

1429750152118611976	Some of the states with the lowest vaccination rates have high #'s in ICU.  I also see Covid cases in HI and VT with the highest # of citizens (75%)  vaccinated have skyrocketing Covid cases.  Is the point that vaccination doesn't do much against Delta, but you don't get as sick?
1475237550642147333	This isn't to say that COVID is a hoax. It is a very real thing. I know many people who have tested positive, including a few who had serious symptoms. I also know people who lost loved ones. But it also feels like, more than anything, there is a significant randomness to it.
1544767353736552448	@COVIDSciOntario Wow! I thought its now clear that Covid Jabs don't prevent infection! How come now its also preventing infections? Didnt we sell you will not be hospitalized or die if you take the jab?
1477370438087057415	@joeygilbertinc If I get COVID and end up in ICU with a fully vaccinated person and they only have one ventilator, why is that other person that sick if the stupid vaccination is so effective?
1384580391420403715	My editorial manager tested -ve for COVID last Saturday after showing symptoms the entire week. I had lunch, coffee and meetings with her today. We sit in the same cabin. Without masks. After complaining of fatigue, she tested positive today for COVID. The tests are a circus.

1426684321037905921	I agree. If you don’t believe in Covid or the vaccine, DO NOT go to the hospital if you get sick! You’ll be taking the place of someone who legitimately needs that bed, like a cancer patient, automobile accident victim, heart attack victim, etc.

1528359048105558018	Not that there was any doubt, but I tested positive for covid this morning.
1579450052460032000	I tested positive for Covid on Oct 6, felt really rough on my birthday on the 5th. I had received a covid booster vaccination just 1 week before coming down with this strain of Covid, feeling rough this strain is immune to vaccination, I wonder whether the jab gave me the virus.
1374835956109385728	@roddreher I pray he recovers.Here is a resource for Covid treatments for hospitalized patients. https://t.co/Mfc5CbYqaf
1538893631200940032	welp, tested positive for COVID today :/ after approximately 2 1/2 years of avoiding it here we are. anyways..! pls send fluffy fics, mellow songs, and cute pics my way 🤧
1480593943175864327	Y'ALL. MY FUCKING GENERAL MANAGER JUST TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVID! me and her are vaccinated and I've been wearing my mask the whole pandemic and she's been wearing hers for a week preparing for yesterday since corporate is making everyone wear masks again.
1485739535258382337	I was 99% sure I had Covid and then I only tested positive for Flu A. How generic of my immune system.
1420807270473084937	I’m not sure I understand the goal these days re: Covid. Is the goal for it not to spread at all, or is the goal for no one to be hospitalized?
1382200635668393989	New pin on #COVID19 variants. I don't know if it's a #Bioweapon or mutating naturally, but do know it's going after people with more T-Cell counts = PEOPLE UNDER 40 are now ending up more and more in ICU's, especially in MI, The final answer will be central quarantines, PERIOD.
1379038846348824582	@FredCDobbz Yet I personally know of a number of people that tested positive and were poorly with covid after the vax
1450659730964115459	@eissyrc I recall numbers from when asymptomatic testing was stopped. There were no parameters (e.g., known exposure to someone who tested + for COVID) to get tested. The rate was something like 0.001% of the asymptomatic tests were positive for covid.
1437472229973954565	The antigen that I took before the flight came back positive, so they made me do a pcr test after I missed the flight. It came back negative, so apparently I don't have Corona. It was a false positive. Lets gooooooo. https://t.co/vGjxX86MjZ
1410517873970188290	It's been 1 month and 20 days I was here. Your memes tweets views sometimes clash of opinions, I was reading all these, watching the show and fighting with covid. I was severly effected by covid. I was tested 3 times positive. ++#ShauryaAurAnokhiKiKahani
1561352859253460994	My stance for #vaccine changed after I had covid, first 2 times it was only, coughing and headache no fever but tested positive. Last time 6 months ago, headache for some hours with very mild symptoms.. so why are some governments like in Italy force
1429398306300567564	@GearoidFogarty @bobduff80 @tangentmu @Postbearmarket1 @Sean_Walsh_1967 No different to the 28 days for covid then except I’ll have more faith in the reporting of the yellow card system, the reports when you open them up one by one make interesting reading. Martin Luther now in hospital, double jabbed with covid, your wearing a blindfold and a mask!
1512890772076605446	All of my family members except for me was tested positive for covid :/
1405963552838410243	@Outcome42 @AMERICAN__TGM 2 months ago when I donated blood I asked if I had the vax if I could still donate. answer yes. if I tested positive for covid but had no symptoms I could donate as well. so far 7 x's I've donated blood since this bs started, nxt wk will make 8
1376211992860590086	Going for my first COVID vaccine tomorrow &amp; was just told about a third person I know who has been fully vaccinated for a month but just tested positive for COVID. Are we being lied to about the percentages of effectiveness? What the hell! Now I’m back to, what’s the point?
1416943161134370816	Having a fever for 3 days. Done a swab test and im POSITIVE COVID19. Please take care everyone.
1456367201007591425	https://t.co/yVaLcAbHMg, no comments allowed?  Let me ask you this. How many hospitalized/died are obese? Children? Other co-morbidities?  Were any in motorcycle accidents counted as covid? Flu? (Oh, yeah. That's been cured).  I call BS.#LetsGoBrandonhttps://t.co/okdwxFYhNf
1384801821764374531	"Them: ""masks are dumb, Covid isn't real."" Them: ""I just tested positive for Covid"" https://t.co/nZqEMuqQyv"
1460206801824141318	@gavreilly @PatKennyNT And still, after almost 2 years, we have no idea how many of those went to hospital with Covid and are being treated FOR Covid as opposed to catching Covid in the hospital, asymptotic, and being treated for something else entirely. Pretty important context, I would say.
1487512936914378753	@airindiain Thanks. I tested positive on Jan 22 and I have a flight to USA on Feb 8. If I have a Covid negative report that shud do it but what if I still test positive? Will a doctors certificate along with Covid positive test allow me to travel to Usa? As per usa guidelines one can do that
1416505066467459075	@adviceforbernie @AlexBerenson No but they are getting very sick. I  know someone who tested positive and he’s very sick now with covid and fully vaccinated
1476746164447764483	@ItsxAva_ I’m ok, tested positive for covid today
1483598730003726344	@prescottcraig @RealCandaceO So..Vaccinated are actually spreading Covid &amp; don't know it? I guess when the Unvaccinated get it they're really sick and stay home or go to the hospital... But the vaccinated get Covid &amp; maybe don't even know it... But are still spreading it???  Now a pandemic of the Vaccinated?
1416055151056523270	What the hell is this govt doing?  More than 50,000 people have tested positive for coronavirus today alone! The UK is heading for an unprecedented wave &amp; with it increased liklihood of a vaccine resistant variant. I think we'll look back on #FreedomDay as a massive mistake.
1383731807221256195	@ABC Die from Covid? Or after having been tested previously with a test that may have given a false positive test, so the bus that hit him then went onto hit the tower that collapsed on him had nothing to do with his death ? Ridiculous statement I know but the real crisis is Gov
1488034592040701952	@Anna__mb @TheAwkwardDrop Girl, you're about a month behind on your talking points. We all know we can still get covid, the vaccines make it so we don't end up in hospital or die. Can you please get some new material? Im actually embarrassed for you.
1394108012521050113	I should say. When I mean scarier and scarier— I was in the hospital on ventilators several times. So COVID for me was really not a little thing. And a big reason I’m so grateful for masks, vaccines &amp; science 😷 🧪 🌱
1360751462372888576	I am positive for Covid antibodies. Given convalescent plasma 2xs &amp; scheduled for a 3rd. Then register for vaccine. I was asymptomatic. If not told to quarantine from a positive test I would not have known. Headache 4 days. Burning in back of nose 2 days. Strange virus
1467493890953564164	@theladyvapes @DrHoenderkamp Unfortunately he passed away sadly, but thank you for your kind comments. I find every person passing from Covid terribly sad, but the ridiculous comments re hospital beds is tedious. Many many people land in hospital through decisions they made but we don’t vilify them.
1379184703194947592	@redamberblack I've never had one &amp; spent 48 hrs in hospital on oxygen with covid symptoms last March. I still don't intend to ever have one. Common sense is all we need 🤗
1526196472152211456	Woke up feeling under the weather, so I took a home Covid test. Came out negative. But if it had been positive, then I would have headed to a clinic on principle for an official test because we're in a surge that isn't acknowledged due in part to the prevalence of home tests.
1386444628774113283	Even staying home EVERY SINGLE DAY for the last 13 months couldn’t save me from getting #Covid I was feeling “off” the other day and took a covid test and I just found out that I’m positive 😑 now I have to “isolate” from my kids for the next 10 days 😫
1484631063913713664	Two days ago I myself started with moderate headache and sore throat, mild myalgia and mild sweating. My panbio @AbbottNews COVID AG test today is positive.I am already on #fluvoxamine 100 mg BID.#CovidTesting #Omicron https://t.co/g8RsjpxqOW
1476746585908387842	@anne_theriault Haha, yeah, I got an email from my county a few hours ago with new guidelines that included, “if you’re diagnosed with COVID, cut isolation time in half. And also if you can’t isolate just go to work in a mask straight after your positive test. Lol k bye.”
1483833673107525634	@vet_dot @Cleavon_MD No I will not just stop. It is a very important question. Children get Covid. Are they in hospital because of Covid? Are they in hospital for other illnesses but have tested positive while there? Unless you have the answer to that the stats are totally meaningless.
1421496865376247810	@Bucky_Diggs @Joe_Arena009 @RBReich Rates are higher for obese people.  Also, I’m pretty sure their fatness didn’t put 16,000 kids in the hospital with COVID this month.  Transmissibility is a public health issue.
1527354150404575256	So I tested positive for Covid on Monday.It's been a hell of a week and although it is great to see @seconddinner finally announced @MarvelSnap, couldn't we have waited another week😭In other news, @OutOfCardsSNAP is a thing so go follow it and you'll see our coverage =)
1373343677062414337	10% of the illegal immigrants being released into the nation in Texas have tested positive for COVID. Open borders are resulting in 200% more illegals coming in.Now, that’s why I call a “super spreader.” Where’s the outrage, Democrats / Fauci?
1557779227289587713	@DrEliDavid I would think someone as smart as her would do the Elon Musk covid test protocol.  That protocol is take six PCR tests all on the same day. But all six have to be at 6 different locations.  Results = some positive and some negative.   PCR test is flawed big time!
1480854931997442048	@Best4thePlanet @kenny818051 @DjokerNole I dont know in which univers you live. If you or i test positive, acording to WHO and CDC we have to quarantine, there is no Buts and Maybes. You may chose to make your own rules, and go out and spread the virus, but i stay home, and save people from getting the covid19.
1463418751332896770	@MaiaDunphy So we are to take it that our natural immune system is no good and we should just believe the vaccine will solve all our problems? No. I was diagnosed with covid back in Feb, I allowed my immune system to do its job and create the antibodies my system needed to fight the virus.
1356300599122419712	I’ve been exposed 9 times to Covid and haven’t tested positive/no symptoms/nothing So why would I get a vaccine!?
1570152225565188097	@Julietilsen I've been to Disney World 3 times, been to concerts, have season tickets to an MLS side, and frequently see lots of people, unmasked.I've never tested positive for COVID, despite my whole family having it at the same time in January.
1450846217399906309	My gf &amp; I both had COVID.  She spent a week in ICU. https://t.co/YKZ5rSYaEw
1531091499462500352	@Joanna_Resists 1) Here's the thing. Both hubby and I had horrible covid. Both hospitalized at the same time. Me longer. Me almost died Literally. I DON'T ever want to go through that EVER again! Him? Attacked his heart! Me on oxygen for weeks after coming home. Because of my experience I had 2)
1614655690689384449	"@Macca_0161 @paul3Simmons @kosta_mira @DrAseemMalhotra LOL ""surprise illnesses""? I'm not ending up in the ICU because of COVID, buddy."
1558397809694572545	@TSherman7777 @ProgSocJazz @HeisriseN007 @TomiLahren And considering that 99% of everyone hospitalized and/or dying from Covid is unvaccinated, I'd say it's a very successful trial.

1522869781849788416	@theatomicrock @TheLaurenChen Your full of shit. Im a pro athlete and in great shape, and was in hospital almost a month from covid, terrible. 2.5 years later still have issues. Stop talking out ur ass

1373821906781052928	@PrisonPlanet Amen.I'm over 50 and had the CONvid last month.Entire year I almost never wore a mask (I do work in some medical areas) &amp; the way we got it was granny's visit to hospital put her on Covid floor. Wife took care of her closely and then got it.I lived and am STRONGER after. 🖕C19 https://t.co/hWaflRHSTW
1417405292355063810	@ShanMoff @Bluehod10 @stkirsch Good for you. I had covid and was told to take Ivermectin ASAP —almost all my symptoms subsided within a couple of days. By all means, if you happen to test positive for COVID someday, don’t take it if you don’t want to.
1337318615150944256	I am allergic to many things doctors told me weren’t possible until I ended up in the ER. One of many includes steroids. If this Covid vaccine can’t work for everyone don’t approve it. Make something safe for everyone. I do not feel like quarantining until I am 80.
1374148751854555137	👇 I will never ever be convinced otherwise that this diseased turd ever had Covid let alone went to ICU just like then &amp; now we’re being played! For pity sake why don’t you see it? 11yrs 250,000+ are dead! Will You or Me be next? https://t.co/uDNy0NUv5G

1409795359883333642	@BerserkFURY07 @A_dmg04 @SirCreuset My team is working remotely because its easier for us to commu- oh wait, no its because someone tested positive because covid doesn't fucking care that people are getting vaccinated.

1486168282466074625	Kid #2 stayed home Monday because of flu-like symptoms so I took her in to get a COVID test. She was worried so I signed up to get one as well, just to show that it wasn’t a big deal.Her results? Negative.Mine? Positive.What the heck.
1545834653810032647	@RantingOwl I was told that, then tested three times bc I didn’t believe it. All negative. I still didn’t believe it wasn’t COVID. The fourth test? Positive.
1476643385419067398	@ImWhiteWTF I've never gone to the hospital for COVID. EVER.
1467180210885963780	@SEMolekwa @robertmarawa Are you not ordered to isolate when you have tested positive for covid have come into contact with someone who has tested positive? Are the rules changing because it is Chiefs? Sanity will prevail once everybody has calmed down, I hope. Life is more important than football
1466567429899919361	Great, and now just got word I was in direct physical contact with someone who tested positive for covid today... this day can't get any worse.
1439238173918437376	betting my life that im gonna test positive for covid
1417893521470656516	Dr. Brytney Cobia said “I’m admitting young healthy people to the hospital with very serious COVID infections”. “One of the last things they do before they’re intubated is beg me for the vaccine. I hold their hand and tell them that I’m sorry, but it’s too late.”
1473365513451581447	My hairstylist tested positive for Covid 😒 now you done did it Omarion!!!!
1475664486019346438	The kids just got out of their quarantine and went back to daycare today for the first time in over 20 days. My daycare provider messaged me and a kid that was at daycare today tested positive for COVID after daycare. She is now closed for 10 days.Fuck my life and this Monday. 🥲
1415525192152096768	So I was out for like a day and the boys are taking covid test because someone who worked with Yohan tested positive and also they are in the casting for a new second lead for School 2021? God, I really hope the boys feel okay and Yohan has been waiting for the filming so long 🙃

1477724349268385794	Someone at work test positive for Covid, so of course my hypochondria is acting up, and I immediately feel every symptom of every known disease known to man.
1464861579447439363	My neighber tested positive for covid. I was around her a lot. She is fully vaccinated.  I tested negative (thank god). And I am not vaccinated
1532869019698618373	tested positive for COVID yesterday. shit in my pants today. literally pooped myself.
1478824927763390470	@Tuquieresmipit0 for some reason my job said they want a positive result from an actual medical provider like cvs or sum they’re annoying af cus there’s not even tests available for anytime soon, if i really did have covid i would be neg by the time i got a test apt -.- but thank you!!!
1325998733239046146	@OrdinaryGamers Pfizer a bio pharmaceutical company has made a vaccine I believe is 90% effective at preventing Covid. It’s early in its studies but test subjects show positive results. That came out earlier today so hopefully the news just gets better.
1418897230350721027	@crazyfillyjonk It has remained very effective at turning covid into the equivalent of a bad cold for ~90% of vaccinated people.And even though there are some more serious breakthrough cases, there are still no vaccinated folks in the ICU around me right now. #goodnews
1434935902644707336	I’m on week 2+ of Delta Covid. I wore a mask. I was vaccinated as was my family, I gave it to them. They’re okay a week in with an infusion. I don’t have an infusion. I have all the symptoms multiple times, I’ve spent part of Labor Day weekend in the ER.
1479424405151309825	@ScrotieMcB Yes, I think the suggestion that they are “inflating” the numbers is incorrect, although there is still validity in highlighting the distinction. Those hospitalized with COVID are less of a burden than those hospitalized for, but they are still an additional burden due to COVID.
1603798718112845827	"@Andrew_Steward9 @JohnGHart @ABridgen Ha what odds would you take ?  I'm 100% not going to get a vaccine adverse event and in the very very unlikely event I actually got "" covid "" not a false positive PCR test id have a 99.8% recovery rate ,why would I take a untested "" vaccine "" you've just admitted does not pr tran"
1436328324171763718	@farel_john @ErikReed I was with you until the last sentence. According to studies (if you can even trust them) most people hospitalized for Covid symptoms were Vit D deficient. And where I live, flu season starts in October - a month or so after we don’t get enough sun to produce enough naturally.
1532024600703422466	Worth mentioning that I went to the ER last night &amp; left after several hours bc hospital was so full (I’m assuming due to COVID?) and bc I was too anxious about the cost. Our healthcare/insurance system is broken. I literally said to my husband “Just bring me back if I pass out.”

1375902967061155848	@MreSSB To my understanding, the 2-shot vaccines make it so, if you happen to catch COVID, you've got a 95% chance of your body just resisting it, and in the 5% chance where it actually does get you, the effects of the virus are mitigated to the point that you wouldn't be hospitalized.
1386940939860652032	@truthwi83122520 @MikeDeery1 @jonlis1 So do you agree then that our Covid death toll recorded by deaths with a positive test in the last 28 days is totally inflated? I assume you do as according to you, people only die of cv if they are on a ventilator in icu with a pipe forcing oxygen into their lungs.
1387845679347736583	@Louis_Tomlinson I've been better, actually... My family tested positive for covid. They're fine, but we were worried anyway.. Stay safe!
1551120152238125056	A message from my wonderful Gp due to the fuckshow of the last few days. “ please follow up any rapid covid tests despite the results with PCR testing...even if there’s a feint positive or a negative result you may be subject to a faulty test or a new variant”.  So glad I did
1475218160865497094	@Brum6666 Even lazier this year. I tested positive for coronavirus.
1409820407394279429	@PollyTragic Just think how many needles you'd have to have if you ended up in hospital with covid... it's worth avoiding that!PS: I got a second tattoo last Thursday.
1549938595498266625	can’t go see attack attack tonight :( i think covid finally got me since two of the people i care for just tested positive for it 🙃 gotta love healthcare
1372920199909928961	Looking back over the semester, the length of my lectures correlates significantly with proximity to my positive covid test. Covid lectures are around 40 minutes, covid-free lectures are about 65 minutes
1444111229241503746	@DoctorAnarchist I live in Florida and no there's no massive surge of covid cases in ICU here in the Tampa Bay area.
1560407758956011521	Wish I could've been there, but I just got a positive covid test
1407381888336080897	So two English players, both tested negative for covid are having to isolate and miss the game because they were in the same vicinity of a Scottish player whom tested positive. Fair enough. One question though, what about the whole if the Scottish team? Am I missing something?

1479572492788416518	@RonColeman If I don't get the vax, you MIGHT or MIGHT NOT catch covid and die. If I don't work, someone that goes to the hospital with any other life threatening condition very likely WILL die because of staffing shortages.
1477910203702128642	@LisaDEFG I've never had coronavirus. I was in the hospital for heart valve replacement surgery.
1544528743145676801	@_ashawndabney Yup. I worked in a Covid clinic, including doing swab testing admin with direct contact with positive cases and still haven't gotten it.
1482805557656391681	Well damn just got notice via text and email half the people in my office tested positive for Covid so it’s considered an outbreak scenario and I’ll be working from home for the week it’s cool I’m technically immune for the next 60 to 90 days according to my doctor and CDC 🤷🏻‍♀️
1373258167065395203	"@HeatherLumsden2 That's when you take your mask off and say ""I was just diagnosed with Covid. Want some?""  Then cough.."
1431659147758538752	whenever i see statistics about how many ppl have died from covid here in usa i think, what's the REAL number? we can only count certain things. so many cases going unreported. so many people never getting tested or going to hospital
1484874392446414849	@OfficialNcoc I tested positive for covid 19.and they didn't register me as a case.
1429242695378251778	"@DefyingGravitee @tendieland @GregSsy @ablogical @SupremacyWoke @mscarasco_live @brightsides People are still going to the hospital while vaxxed. Now what? Not everyone who's unvaccinated has COVID. And you literally just said what I did, again, they're ""wasting resources"". Soooo I'm not understanding why you're triggered and trying to argue🙄🤦🏾‍♀️"
1428602010287448064	Today i had the worst anxiety attack of my life. I was in the hospital and boy oh boy I was out of my head. The bed felt odd, the cloth gown felt odd, the iv thing on me felt odd and worst of all because i had similar symptoms of covid they left me in a room ALL ALONE. I hated it
1463279870440394753	Welp, our 3 yr old nephew has tested positive for Covid, and we’re forced to cut our family’s Thanksgiving plans off at the knees. Sending out a big  “fuck you!” to every anti-mask, anti-vaccine asshole in here Idaho, without whom I’m almost certain this would not have happened.
1487313920868196357	@RougeMenace Obviously you've lost your moral compass. I'm sure there are vaccinated people in the ICU. Most of the people who catch covid don't end up in ICU anyways. Otherwise, the hospitals would have completely crashed in 2020 when there were no vaccines.
1477383169192120324	More people in my life have tested positive for COVID in the last 2 months than the last 2 years, but sure, let’s just continue on with business as usual. Nothing to see here, have fun with your 5 day quarantine and see you at work next Monday!
1510497772893782019	Covid is working its way down my row of desks in the staff room. It’s just me and the wall now. Unless I am god tier, it seems I should have my positive test just in time for *checks notes* the school holidays when I was going to *checks notes* see my partner.
1373030162527363074	@strutt1313 There's a podcast I listen to called CULTRA. One of the hosts had a 40 year run streak. Got covid about a month ago and was hospitalized for a while. I know he's happy to be recovering but can you imagine loosing that streak?
1386356656230092805	@lauren_yates @UKCovid19Stats I think the daily death reports should stop in the next couple of months and we could just use the weekly ONS figures using death certificates. Pretty soon most of the deaths will be coincidental within 28 days of a positive test rather than actually of Covid.
1480332128797691904	I love the fact you need a negative RAT once diagnosed with COVID. But you can't get a RAT anywhere and the only reason you end up with COVID is because you're looking for a RAT. How good is it having politicians who make healthcare decisions!
1576045662902550528	I just talked to @PriismX..they got him to Phoenix and settled in the hospital there and he asked to let everyone know the GAUNTLET for Sat is postponed. Please keep him in your prayers he has covid.
1429241320325877761	@atrupar I see a bunch of people with a collective IQ of 70 half of whom will likely be in the hospital with COVID in the next week or two.
1548326437035290625	"Morning..I'm going to skip the ""Good"" today, sorry🥺 2 out of my 3 BF tested positive for Covid today. This shit is still running wild, no matter how careful someone is, it can still get you. You can even bring it home &amp; not know it. THIS IS OUR NEW NORMAL, you can't be to safe."
1560004578678022144	dr sent me to the hospital and it sounds like covid everywhere take me home rn
1481828160941576193	Still very minimal symptoms. Am I tired because covid or because life? For what it's worth, I have a positive rapid test and I'm waiting on PCR results. All my contacts (including the kids) have negative rapid tests and are waiting on PCR results too.
1430286331431821315	My wife tested positive for Covid so there will be no stream for a little while. Keep us in your prayers as I always keep y’all in mine 🤲🏾💯
1505624463223795724	@paulbristow79 My wife tested positive for Covid today. Next week she has a long awaited appointment with a consultant @PASHFT &amp; if she cancels it could be ages before she gets a 2nd appointment. So does she stay or does she go? What is your advice to her?We’re both #Peterborough voters.
1403920670380027905	I have tested positive for Covid -19. So, all please pray for me. And I request guys please stay home, stay safe and wear musk.
1376136114155704322	Anybody else get extremely paranoid again for the first time in a while about contracting COVID *after* they got their first shot? Having visions of somebody maskless coughing on me on the sidewalk *just* before my body is inoculated and ending up in the hospital
1476311294294863876	"@that_chapter Long time fan. (#same I tested positive today) Does it make you angry that you've gone 2 years COVID free and safe and now ""kicked in the nuts"", No prize."
1383760005753544704	Received text message from #NHS this morning that I’ve been identified as contact of someone who has recently tested positive for Covid. I took a Covid test on Day 2 of my isolation in a hotel &amp; الحمدللّٰہ  it has come back Negative.
1432077042577727504	@NotHoodlum If you like ivermectin I have a much better idea for you. Stuff some seriously hot peppers up your rectum.  It could certainly cure covid, and it would certainly give the folks in the ER a good laugh.
1481634515327938560	My fucking COVID test came back positive YC  https://t.co/FAGcREzOIP
1443939794216697865	I went to a COVID party and all I got was a trip to the ICU! https://t.co/aHtPkBvD5x https://t.co/d8HLM3Y4vx
1376631201604235264	So I recently tested positive for COVID and the worst part is I just started not being able to taste anything and it’s so annoying.
1476283985521221636	I have recently been diagnosed with COVID. In an effort to not feel completely isolated, I’m gonna post on here more, some “Tales from the Quarantine” I guess. Feel free to share. Or ignore. idc. I just want to put stuff out there so I feel less alone.
1513195002465247232	covid update: symptoms are subsiding. still have a cough. still tested positive this morning after 5 days. hoping i can kick this thing in time to play fresno next weekend.
1456639861452984320	@ReggieDunlop007 @glennbeck The vaccine will not stop you from getting Covid. It doesn’t work. It will not stop you from getting Covid. I personally know 5 people that have Covid now. The 3 that are vaccinated are in the hospital on ventilators or oxygen. The 2 unvaccinated are home.
1422573164480155650	@DanielRollTide I just took a family member to the ER a couple of nights ago. Nurse said they are seeing a lot of Covid patients in the ER but not admitting many at this time.
1382101540580716546	damn bro i really tested positive for covid this late in the game 😩😩😩😩
1350574816764444674	Let's be honest, the COVID Vaccine is a FAILURE, or otherwise it would be super effective against COVID and the new COVID strain. But for a person to test positive for COVID-19 A DAY AFTER taking the Vaccine, it's just unexplainable and unreal. That's why I DON'T trust it at ALL!
1378720714493063171	The old...It doesn't affect me until it does...adage. Until she was diagnosed with Covid, she was posting anti-mask videos and promoting businesses that were violating mask mandates.
1427775963396333573	@NathPernod @GillianMcKeith Over my dead body. This is the exact reason why you should not get tested. Now they will say another Covid case in hospital.
1451986922293825540	I’ve managed to not get covid from the start of the pandemic and now it looks like it’s caught up with me! Had a positive LFT so got a PCR test this afternoon 😡
1431689195282706432	Should we end mass testing for covid? (i.e. return to hospital testing)
1363528129998946313	@ILuvDryHeat @SaskiaPopescu @angie_rasmussen The point is pro vaccine. People are not understanding that aide effects can last weeks. They think they have covid. They get a fast Rapid Test and it is positive. I slow PCR test comes back negative. They do not have Covid. Rapid test found antigens generated by vaccine.
1399261631469731841	Im so bskajdofk bout getting vaccinated due to having like a horrible I mean in the hospital for weeks horrible reaction to every vaccination I’ve had. I probably will because I want to keep those around me safe as-well as its better than covid but idk the hospital sucks
1467527409142415364	@Tikka300mag @RepSwalwell @mtgreenee Statistically, more covid in hospital patients were unvaccinated.I follow science, not a fucking  moron with the mentality of a chimpanzee https://t.co/107Br62ufD
1402835703801724930	@RebelChick1111 @AlexBerenson @BuckSexton @ClevelandClinic Could be false positives based on PCR cycles.  Could be still testing positive as we know happens for at least 3 months.  Could be they weren't actually tested both times and assume it was covid.  I've had people tell me they KNOW they had covid w/o comfirm.
1364343021622288387	Physicians! I have a Covid question. It may be dumb but I don’t care.If you get the Covid vaccine and test right after, will you test positive for Covid? Thank you in advance
1477762565115686913	My homie was expose to covid from someone who tested positive and continued to show up to work knowingly having covid. Some people just don’t care.

1619096389228822529	@YouAreLobbyLud Yeah same happening with my neighbour - heart attack in December with double bypass and 1 month later still in hospital due to complications of catching Covid in hospital! We've now had more Australian Covid deaths this month than all of 2022 combined!

1434278880274046977	I feel bad for this lady. But we are ALL being lied to by the gov. No need for anyone to be in hospital with covid. Scream for ivermectin and others that work. Vaccines won’t save us. It’s the opposite. Fvcking wake up.

1366759773304102915	Interesting comparisons. I presume the covid numbers would be substantially higher if we hadn’t taken steps to mitigate the spread.Imagine if we had a vaccine that prevented dying (or even going to the hospital) in a car crash!https://t.co/L3FVmW3HdO https://t.co/sGRN1q49pF

1378470698037899267	@LadyZestington @sweetboys @AndrewSiwicki @Garrett_Watts Lol I did actually have covid back in January and was in the ER 😬 but yup this is a lot better than covid itself
1379752070291460098	Update on my J&amp;J covid vaccine. I had a strange reaction of an super high fever, high heart rate, stuttering, extreme cold. I am currently chilling in ER waiting on my thyroid bloodwork.
1484320457713020932	@Sandradees2121 Why does everyone run to ER if they think they have Covid ? If you can breath , stay home ! My hospital is the same . No one wants to work either . If they have the sniffles , they call in sick . This hysteria of testing yourself for Covid is ridiculous.
1440374549741146130	"@outofsight68 @FergalBowers @rtenews Where I'm from a poor creator 86ish passed last week in hospital,he ""tested pos"" 5 or 6weeks back,went in last week covid particles kept showing,he passed later in week,""covid death"" family fought it,hospital changed it,,god knows how many vulnerable went down as same #rip"
1456650848445116420	Test positive we obviously can't go and I don't have enough money to order food for two weeks!!! I'm literally so stressed and creating all these problems for myself when I might not even have Covid but like what if I do?
1522827003061276672	@Jessica23227665 @KristySwansonXO Mmm. The media was the master of the pandemic. They rode the cash cow of peoples fears and I seen a lot of death but no worse than a bad winter. Then one magical day, when we said so, suddenly people just stopped having COVID in the hospital. They tried this in 2003/SARS
1516200317926494208	@real_safespaces You RTd a mum who was in the ER with her baby who was having febrile seizures as a result of covid just to make a point.  I’m not sure she was over reacting, and you calling attention to it by RTing her and calling her her hysterical isn’t exactly empathetic.
1386141536492998658	@sluts_guts I can assure you as someone who works in a hospital it's not as bad as you would think it is. I've known lots of people that work in the hospital that I've had covid and they've all recovered within a week. Including myself.
1471505375698440195	My grandbaby, who is immunocomprised, was exposed to COVID by a family member who tested positive. Thank God the baby tested negative. The family member who tested positive is triple-vaxxed, so be very careful, People.
1604621256149438464	@StephanLotteri3 @Logically_JC I've taken 3 Pfizer and 2 Moderna, inc the bivalent. I also haven't caught COVID in nearly 3 years.An acquaintance was too busy to get vaccinated. He was hospitalized w/COVID, got myocarditis &amp; died of heart failure. COVID causes myocarditis at far greater rates than the vax.
1381072012223918080	Awhile ago I had an abrasion on my throat and my regular doctor refused to see me because anything throat related *could be COVID* so I had no choice but to go to the ER where they gave me benzocaine lozenges. The bill came today. $2700. 🙃
1388271155044302848	The university is letting vaccinated people stop getting weekly covid tests because—this surprised me!—it’s more likely that a positive test is a false positive than that it’s asymptomatic covid
1468490097905524738	@IanDunt I thought “tested positive for covid” was the standard excuse nowadays when you just don’t want to do something?
1421671892981747713	@SofiaLuvsFun @itosettiMD_MBA @RoxanaDaneshjou They did not discover this until I was in the hospital and had no antibodies showing. I had both vaccines, covid itself, three different transfusions of convalescent plasma- zero antibodies still. It had to do with B cell depletion/ immunosuppressive stuff. Atypical case!
1526631451944714240	Tested positive for Covid this morning - I’m impressed I’ve managed to evade it for this long! But, my brain is in a sleepy Covid fog and I have an EMA to write that’s due in next week. My final ever piece of work as an #OU undergraduate. As if it wasn’t hard enough already…
1561648090167365632	@unfeltsorrow Terrible. I did another covid test, was kind of hoping it was positive but no. So don’t know what this is, everything hurts and I don’t trust the GP. Damn.
1488329922456080389	@ServiTui @seabass14648457 I'm a physician who works in ICU, would you like to tell me you're area of medical expertise?  We've had 15 deaths from Covid in Alberta the last 7 days. 58 deaths in Ontario yesterday from covid.
1403106798886952963	Dying of thirst in the hospital bc I cannot drink or eat in it bc of covid
1473758131838717965	@CheyCab I also sadly know someone who has tested positive for covid, is symptomatic and is still doing whatever with no mask.
1420375926349697026	@MarkChangizi I’m a Pharma Rep, must test every 2 weeks for Covid… I’m anti-mask, anti-vaccine, pro clean hands.  Docs give their COVID positive patients High doses of vitamin C, D and iron.  I’ve traveled coast to coast by car &amp; plane, hotels, multiple dr offices/day, never a positive test. https://t.co/MthnK8JMbh

1472636308233146371	@retort_the @jordanbuckley4 Why does Aaron Rodgers need the vaccine?  Why do my kids need it?  They are literally both in a group that has a ZERO percent chance of being hospitalized for Covid.  They don't need it, them not getting it changes nothing for anyone.  Maybe less money from lobbyists....
1428053770076925952	"@beth72 @CnoirBlaque @OklahomaCovid Those are ""Hospital Surge Tiers"" not COVID Alert Tiers. Every color in that scheme is related to hospital beds, not COVID case loads.Are they selling one as a replacement for the other? It doesn't look its supposed to be, but I suppose that doesn't mean they aren't doing it."
1481773176497623040	@nihil_ad_rem I went to the hospital last week due to pneumonia and I refused to stay when they said I could because the hospital is full of covid patients. I didn't like the odds of staying, safer in my house.
1472223815275106306	@RBrookman34 @ClayTravis I also believe that if these alternative drugs were rolled into treatment guidelines if we see better results. Most  patients who are diagnosed with covid are told to go home until they are sick enough to need treatment.
1481458862645399553	@brokenbinch I’m so fucking sorry. If it makes you feel better I have Covid (admittedly I am boosted) but I am not dying or need to go to the hospital and I’m super immune compromised.
1388570788354269296	A little surprised to see 1,707 new infections in Ohio today. I hope it’s just a blip. State again saw high “new” hospitalizations - 89 and 14 in ICU - but overall patient levels took a big drop to 1,124. Vaccinations down from last Saturday. #ohio #COVID19 #CovidVaccine
1435501092918284292	@BaltimoreKammi @eSEy_Bee I been saying this all along. Unvaxt victims of covid should never be admitted to hospital. Give them some Kleenex and Vick’s vaporub and turn them around at the door. Tell them good luck and go home. Since it’s “not real” anyway, they’ll be fine. 🙄
1445684463971667976	@KotakBankLtd @KotakEducation @Buddy4Study After paying three month due to covid my was in icu she came out from death bed and we spend like 15 lakh sir  I m fully broken I req them to give me 2 months  time from December I will start paying 10000 ans 5 month case close  and  i req them but they are not  listening

1422825491803688961	@kurtruslfanclub @oz_f @LeenaVanD c) They don't mean much, I know people who tested negative multiple times before receiving a positive result (they were sure they had COVID). Not to mention all those people who didn't test.2. VIC &amp; QLD Premiers
1486811535255031808	Someone in my kid's class tested positive for COVID.  My kid is fully vaccinated. I took him out of school anyway, and tested him.  He's negative.
1487671202101424131	@LawlessJenny @d0404b @CatEMason @MarkMcGowanMP @covidliveau Only about 1% of active cases in Victoria in hospital, so I wouldn’t be too confident based on the hospital numbers that there isn’t a lot undetected Covid in WA, especially if it is spreading among young people
1446279904685821961	State decided to send me a 'quarantine for 10 days' post covid packet. They waited 16 days since I was diagnosed to print it, then sat on it for 5 days before finally mailing it to me.That's California for ya.
1556393408901644288	I look good asf considering I went to the hospital w. Covid yesterday https://t.co/qxzbTajDvp
1470113793128775683	@notmatt69420 @Countrythought4 @RobinRD4MO @benheckman_ Man I literally just had someone close to me die from covid and a couple family members in the hospital for the same reason. If you think wishing the same fate on anyone else is ok then you need to reevaluate your life choices.
1602229783596875776	I test positive for covid on the same day that @dadwroteaporno ends?This ain't a coincidence 😔
1508630640941740032	As much as I ducked and weaved, I unfortunately tested positive for Covid last week. Now tested negative and out of home isolation.  Very fortunately though to only have experienced very mild symptoms. Stay safe out there folks.
1479582727259271171	My poor F in Law . 81 , a veteran . Appendix burst 2 days after Xmas . Emergency surgery . Been in ICU since . Infections that are not responding to antibiotics . Breathing difficulties . Lost 8 Lbs . Now the hospital calls my wife to say he has COVID . Poor old bugger .
1377975936575025160	@CMackechnie @DNA_EFC @kaytkaytkayt @PoliticsForAlI @Telegraph 1 in 6 people who re-catch Covid are likely to die when admitted to hospital; I think that’s enough of a push to get the jab. You are not forced to get a jab, nor do you have to go on holiday abroad
1446646997319102465	@LocoQf @BreitbartNews Everyone i know in last 2 months whos tested positive for covid has been fully vaccinated
1457271279506149380	5th day since I provided a positive Covid test. How long before things start to improve? It’s awful. Goodness knows what it would be like if I hadn’t had my jabs. If you haven’t had yours I implore you to get them!
1489322926037897220	Who's going to remind me to get on the stream tonight? I haven't since I was in the hospital. Totally screwed up my memory. Covid brain!
1479757810019749894	@kaakoda_moore @JustMe4Now0 @BenRothenberg I agree, but I’d rather that were the case than interacting with fans whilst having tested positive for Covid
1398019771325730817	i tested positive for covid 😀
1475997546262761475	The point was to stop people dying from Covid. I'm fully vaccinated and boosted, and I could still get Covid. But hopefully I won't die or have to be hospitalized. 🙄
1376919640270573570	starting today i’m on a 14 day quarantine thanks to my job getting shut down yesterday (for the 6th time in the 3 mo. I’ve been working there) due to a positive COVID test from an employee
1379087061735604226	I always thought I couldn’t wait to get visitors that would bring balloons and stuff to the hospital but covid ruined that😭 I try to make the best out of this though trynna finesse it a little.
1504911808565493768	@Kirsty_Louise04 I was in hospital last year none Covid problem and hearing some of the stories from the nurses who looked after Covid patients was some what upsetting x
1451842819677687815	I received 3 vaccines (also the flu one). I always wear a mask and I try to keep social distance as much as I can. However, I tested positive to Covid19 and I’m home with minor symptoms. I’m wondering without receiving the second dose of the vaccine how sick I would be now. https://t.co/4MsJbUv1tT
1476681650612355087	@MckeoughJeffrey @LOVEUTOODREAM The mask provides some protection until this that person gets vaccinated because with the booster it provides some protection and all I’m saying is it’s better to avoid serious illness  of Covid 19 and experience death in the hospital bed
1420382104496472072	@MrNukemCocaine @MonolithicPeak @fuctmind Thats actually what they put on in the hospital rooms when treating covid patients. I dont work in a hospital thank you sorry duh!
1545281791354961922	@Cover4Caravans @IOWElsie Well just to complicate things I had Covid 2 weeks ago tested positive at same time wife had same symptoms but less so has tested negative the whole time weird
1355800989132087299	@jbhearn I worry that if a vaccinated person can still test positive for Covid, it may be used to suggest that the vaccine is ineffective or less effective - and the restrictions will continue.
1443363566757765120	@MikeBensons57 Different departments? Regardless of the 30+ people I know of that caught covid 2 where hospitalized. Fortunately everyone is okay now.
1457691679029354500	@mollyblackall We're testing almost twice as many people now as last summer so of course more people will test positive on admission. That doesn't mean they're all being treated for covid. Honestly this really isn't difficult stuff to research. I thought journos were meant to research things?
1489331911159959552	@ppclondonwest @CanadianPM have tested positive 4 times I’m thinking it’s HIV not Covid
1473186541329649666	@KimMangone Good for Boston.looking out for its citizens. More states &amp; cities need to do exactly what Boston is doing. I’m tired of this.Vaccinated people have no rights anymore. Can’t even get medical care. In Mi people have been told not to go to the er because it’s full of covid. Really?
1380172798472024071	@rs1_sooya And there's no bed in hospital all bed are mainly occupied by covid patients I'm done. Our CM svcks omg 💀
1450600736920854529	Unfortunately- I am currently quarantined with a breakthrough case of covid.Fortunately- No one around me tested positive. &amp; I have no symptoms.I am so grateful that both me and the people around me are vaccinated. Vaccines work!
1542112903695929350	@JordanSchachtel We had dozens of patients diagnosed with Covid last month in my nursing home. We still do tests on all patients. ALL went on Paxlovid except for the ones who couldn’t swallow pills and they did IV monoclonal antibodies.
1387379598342688769	This is just stunningly irresponsible. What is wrong with these people?YOUNG PEOPLE CAN STILL GET COVID. I’M 34 AND GOT HOSPITALIZED AND IT REALLY SUCKED! Getting a vaccine makes you woozy for a day and otherwise comes with no discernible risk.
1430734914949894146	@ZeroCOVID4Ever One time I tested positive for covid and I felt kinda lousy. I made my kids get tested twice a day for 14 days. They never tested positive, but I made them stay home for a month in case they were really sick but didn’t know it.  I mean this thing is so contagious!!
1514875090776772615	Bout to take this covid test I pray it's positive 🙏🏼
1483952639587106820	pls pray for my mil she just tested positive for Covid and it’s been bad!
1388443696627130370	@JeMari81 Doctor still not sure if my week of exhaustion, low fever and sore throat was really Covid or a relapse of Epstein Barr....same symptoms....but I ended up in the hospital a year earlier with a fever of 105 due to the flu....the flu was much worse and I was sick for two weeks..
1473618445375836163	@nxcare hi guys. Unfortunately someone close to me tested positive for covid that I'm supposed to be travelling to visit tomorrow. Will I be able to get a refund since this is out of my control? I don't know what other dates I can travel yet so I can't currently amend the booking
1416282242343751683	I mean to you unvaccinated peeps…your choice. Lol…But realize you wanna go to the hospital when you’re mad sick from covid and end up stressing our med people. Be considerate and lets all get vaxxed. 🥴
1469994862044856324	@soody2021 @arvindgunasekar I'm worried about the consequences of all rallies, marriages, movie theatres and gathering people have stopped using masks and sanitization In one of a school in Karnataka 101 kids test positive for COVID 3rd wave will hit very soon It's good to see people at @RahulGandhi
1443030384757940230	So wife is showing every symptom of covid. So call Valley Regional in #Claremont #NH ER and they tell me to just wait till the morning and go else where. That they dont want possible positive covid people there. They said they do test but theyd rather not test someone that has it
1475974903388061700	They really need to shut this shit back down the amount of positive Covid test I’ve seen in adult and pediatric patients is scary
1478934105622519810	Some of my family who are vaccinated tested positive for covid and for the second time I'm negative. I'm grateful and happy for me but feel bad for them especially when some got that booster shot as well and still got the virus.
1428712026696818693	Covid is real, I have family members who are in the ICU rn because it..

1556276239857483776	Why is my job saying you can still come to work if you test positive for covid but don’t have any symptoms ???? That is for you spread that shit wtf.

1559604199838457856	@stallfortime @danaparish My girlfriend had 3 teeth fall out when she had Covid. She was very sick 2 times in hospital. They said it could be vascular- not enough oxygen getting to her jaw.
1373486961210519555	@retiredknitwit @laurenboebert I think the key point you failed to address is the positive covid tests. What do you think happens to American citizens if we knowingly walked around the general public with a positive covid test? Would it bother you at all you moron?

1427171437887070209	And if you have covid at home treat yourself with vitamin C, D, &amp; Zinc. Use elderberry syrup too. Tylenol if you end up running a fever &amp; DayQuil if you’re congested. I’ve tested positive 2 times and got better within a week with these.
1477068823350190082	My husband is fully vaccinated and boosted with moderna. He tested positive for Covid on Monday. He’s had a cough, congestion, and a sore throat for one day. I miraculously tested negative. Vaccines work.

1484268575783366657	@pulte I tested positive for covid today and I’m gonna be out of work for 10 days, anything at all will help pay bills! $brittneym2001
1393797880159166464	So I’m eating this girls ass last night when I notice I can’t taste any of her sweet body juices, I start to panic that maybe I have covid. The next day I went to go find out and sure enough I tested positive for HIV *whew* thank god, I really thought I caught the rona yall 😅
1399363367593205764	Of course I have tested positive for coronavirus ON THE FIRST DAY OF HALF TERM AND DURING A HEATWAVE. 😭
1537583492854423553	"@mur1701 @sunlorrie ""...90% followed the measures...""I know, I can see the results of that: triple vaccinated make up the bulk of hospitalized cases, sudden adult death syndrome, and those getting Covid for the umpteenth time.Keep following the ""science."" What (more) can go wrong?"
1467054791993872385	@SteveCass14 I mostly agree except to say that some people can't isolate entirely (eg they're in hospital or a care home).  They should have the right not to be exposed to unvaccinated people as long as it remains the case that the vaccinated are less likely to pass on Covid.
1479161131524661261	awesome news! oliver tested positive for covid this morning and now i get to play the waiting game for when i’m gonna get it too!
1359004583335452672	@azsweetheart013 I tested positive for COVID on Jan. 19. Fatigue was the key thing that got me early, but I got an IV infusion because of my CHF (atrial flutter). Can't remember how long I have to wait until I am able to get my vaccine if I become eligible.
1478427788344451076	My suburban hospital has a COVID census higher than a year ago, similar numbers in ICU. Our area about 70+% vaxxed. Our office, which has largely avoided infection has 2 staff out including one doc. She got from unvaxxed family and grandkids. DDS, office manager and cop.
1382292669435678722	Thinking how when I caught Covid I never went to the hospital because I personally believe God heals, and his time is the best remedy. That’s facts, I still believe that everyday.
1425472392541966340	@tucsoniris This always makes me smile. This and the people at the opposite end who are anti-vaxx, spread BS, and think Covid is the flu getting put into the ICU. The bookends of people warrantbeing laughed at when their BS works against them.
1596801229312913408	Just as I was getting back to 'normal' after a bad dose of flu, I have now tested positive for COVID, as has the other half. Stuck indoors for another week! 🙁
1607171332483022849	IT'S A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE!I JUST TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVID.First time for me. Fully boosted, feels like a bad cold so far.
1385402411280474116	@Victronix @Cernovich What I meant is that some who tested COVID positive, had flu. But nobody was even tested for flu. Flu and COVID have the similar markers but there is a difference. By now pharmacists should be out of Tamiflu completely. But the supply is untouched. Because everything became Covid
1376235244228124672	@PrimeNumberOne @GNev2 I understand your point but for me the focus ha to be on cutting down serious illness and deaths which it appears we are being successful with. I’ve had covid and a vaccine if I test negative I don’t see why I can’t travel and if positive then I isolate
1369857831965401092	@Andromeda124 @chick_in_kiev My formerly-healthy wife is a longhauler, COVID last March, breathing+ issues thru summer, diagnosed with autonomic neuropathy stemming from COVID in Dec. It’s ceaseless &amp; the guidance on getting a vaccine remains fuzzy bc some with this neuropathy worsened. Stay safe &amp; vigilant!
1387596340444663812	@CTVWindsor @fordnation @JustinTrudeau tell you things but would they honour it? Paid sick leave? How about pay the sick Who contracted COVID as essential. 30 days in hospital, critical care health benefits insurance would not pay &amp; E.I. Sick leave stops at 13 weeks @EvanLSolomon
1460618312870727684	@usgolf95 @D7M1888 @jamesenglish0 As a population yes. Compare that to people im close with its opposite. Governments own figures show around 80% of those in hospital with covid are fully vax. Dont care if people take vax or not its the coercion &amp; forced restrictions of those who don't im against.
1483942260999958529	Got my Covid test results and I’m still positive. It’s been almost 3 weeks since I’ve first got sick😩
1378514540170731522	@Shane0607 @kennycovington1 @irish_dan82 I know well over 50 people who have had Covid, none have those problems Also, think about all the NCAA athletes who have been diagnosed.  You know they are being monitored and haven't heard of any of them experiencing those changes either.
1459841038839914499	going to work for the first time since i tested positive for covid 😷 i feel better now but im still a bit anxious
1489534232397553666	@MartinSLewis @itvMLshow I hear you Martin... I have to go to hospital next week, waiting 2 years for this and I'm petrified that my covid test the day before will be positive and the procedure cancelled 😬 .. 🤞🤞🙏
1436851669778718720	Yeah Larry ! and thank you…if we cannot protect our young, what good are we as a species ? My SIL got both Pfizer shots and tested covid positive yesterday. It knows no bounds, a virus strives to exist. That’s the fight-and I feel so helpless. Stay well everyone 💛
1533053502045429760	@JonJonesSnr I bet @BorisJohnson is wishing he’d fakes a positive covid test too now #BoosforBoris
1384803131347718145	@DilliDurAst I know of at least two families where after vaccination, within the week, they got COVID symptoms and tested positive by 10th day. No exposure. The third person was known through someone. Vaccinated within a week before COVID. The surge also coincides with vaccinatn.
1429381349631315970	Came out negative on my covid test but positive for being a real one 💯🤘🏼😆
1483107793863335941	My family be telling everybody business and judging everything. They whole household got Covid and been in the hospital but didn’t want to make a big deal about it. lol SMH
1417733514892619779	@theJeremyVine Well, according to my management team (work in a care home), getting pinged means u can continue working as normal... that staff member tested positive 2 days later and brought covid back into the care home
1454044353123520519	@MazC1975 @reece_dinsdale It's horrible. I hope you don't get the breathing problems with it, I've never had any trouble with my breathing but with covid I was fighting to get a breath in. Luckily I didn't have to go to hospital but it was awful. X
1465454306673442820	@cynclagar NO ‼️  Just lost my job ICU Nurse an RN 38 yrs in  ICU &amp; COVID ICU UNIT ! last 18 Months  We  All left our Stethoscope Scrubs ID Badges PPE Shoes in Lobby all See come in Hospital We We're Heros Last YR now We're TRASH !👿Working 60 hrs + A Week  PPE  Safety Do You Miss us YET ?
1532200213112410114	@TheBlueGem3 Me too. I think we had a very similar Covid timeline. I first tested positive last Thursday. I’m still testing positive today and you aren’t. Very interesting.
1611978803659800576	@Valkyrae rae we have the same birthday :-D except i tested positive for covid today :-(
1416691711099777024	@IrelandsPeace I heard she's in hospital after getting the covid 19 thing.
1404183914072129545	The hubby was admitted to the ER via ambulance just a few moments ago, damn covid guidelines- they won’t let me in to be with him until the staff is sure he doesn’t have covid. We tested negative yesterday, so hopefully they will let me in soon..
1468238922752970754	if this covid test comes out positive i have a few words for my booster shot
1442751995106975747	@ezralevant Hm? I Fall from my roof, shattered my bone, so what do you want?You cant go to work, did you make a covid test?No? I Broke my leg, why should I...So, ok. We have again a positive Covid Situation here. Damn.
1379000307007520768	@grayphil27 There’s already a little girl who tested a grape. It was positive. It’s on tik Tok and called me grapes got corona
1475466780256657421	@LG24321 @Craig_A_Spencer Many of the ones I've seen with mild symptoms come to ER because they're scared and want immediate Covid testing, they don't want to wait to book a test. Horrible waste of resources, incredible strain on staff.
1449113980472074243	The amount of long covid complications I’m seeing in the hospital is really picking up. It isn’t pretty. Get vaccinated #GetVaccinated @ctvottawa @OttawaHealth @CBCOttawa @CFRAOttawa
1480892267707645958	I recently had my hours cut significantly and then tested positive for covid. This is just one of the many bills stacking up for me. A little help would do alot right now $007xnc 🙏🙏 https://t.co/Gw9Ts9g7OY
1481352353940852736	Last night a 55 year old man I’ve known since the 1980’s passed from Covid.  A non vaxer… in the hospital for 1 month, on the vent for 3 weeks.  This is the second non vaccinated person I know that has died within two months.  Please get vaccinated..  please.
1518081880138010624	@faizh_cissi Hopefully I don't cause bye world💀But I'm absolutely pissed that she didn't tell me she wasn't feeling good until today. She's been saying everybody at her workplace has tested positive for COVID -_-
1376566067481477123	Looking at my chart &amp; noticing that I got my first covid test exactly a month before my next one... the one that will probably come back positive 😔
1426568019380260866	@MrDrewHashtag @ScottAdamsSays IOW, obesity levels in persons hospitalized with COVID are about the same levels as in the general population.I think obesity is getting way too much blame for this.
1474159096756686853	Just tested positive for Covid. Whoops lol.Wasn’t feeling that great yesterday, but doing better now. And I already have my vaccine, so I think I’ll be alright. 10 days of quarantine for me.
1522575694429048833	@bigsnugga @nostalgic_scott @JackieMoonPies I was out in it all the time supporting businesses, wife worked at her job saw multiple people everyday (different).  No concern whatsoever, Caught Covid Christmas no biggy and you can test positive for how many weeks lol.
1480578966545178627	I was informed this morning that a close contact has tested positive, thus beginning my ‘is this covid or just my paranoia?’ thoughts every 10-15 minutes.
1372709435039219713	@blucanguy @MaryanskiDavid @Mike72079603 @POTUS And that is an exaggeration because they didn’t all die from Covid. Like in Illinois where I live, currently right now if someone dies and they previously tested positive even months ago for Covid, it’s still written as a Covid death. Like this gem that just came out. https://t.co/HYWGyOWNYr
1376702841272864772	@jupiter2012 Most of my patients have CVID; I just read a chart today on a patient who had COVID back in November, tested positive for two months, and still has no antibodies.
1476345015169282052	So from two samples taken at the same time, I tested positive on one (Abbott IDNOW rapid molecular, received results within 3 hours) and negative on the other (PCR, received results 5 days later). Did I catch schrodinger’s covid? Anyone know how to interpret this?
1372615619841908736	Loosing someone during covid and not being able to visit them in the hospital is something I wouldn’t wish on anyone.
1441890189811412993	@shoe_jimmy1 @damiantardio So far no protestors have gone to hospital ( except the idiot with Covid the next day). Over 13 cops have been hospitalised. Gee..I wonder who is more brutal..cops or covidiots 🤦‍♂️
1488789060214824960	I got my period and a positive covid test on the same day. Do I get a prize?
1428501244558159876	We’re *checks watch* 3 days into the school year and just found out the kid who sits next to my kid tested positive for Covid. Quarantining him for 10 days per CDC. Fuck you, @GregAbbott_TX.
1379124803198611458	@UnspokenTruthzz I wasn’t hospitalized but fought Covid for 5 weeks .. those who think it’s just like the flu are crazy
1376965460604940292	Hey guys. I had a bad reaction to the covid vaccine. I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I’m currently in the hospital. Would love if anyone can pray and send me all the love and positivity as none of my family is allowed to see me 😭❤️ #WynonnaEarp #EarperSupport
1441568273577951232	@greta I had covid March 2020 ...vax wasn't out yet...I DIDNT  end up in hospital in ICU.
1464940135636779014	This should be put up in as many places as possible! We need to embarrass the selfish into facing the facts. After nearly 12 months recovering from COVID I really don't want to go back to hospital - ever!
1386213870260277252	@perfectrose2011 So many teachers and kids in my school district have had Covid it’s crazy, but lucky nobody had gone to the hospital.
1481724103945949184	i’m opening a bar for people that have covid. no positive test, no entry
1460534264416522243	@cbseindia29 saying that they follow all COVID protocols during the examination than I want to ask one question to @cbseindia29 #CISCE &amp; @dpradhanbjp that If the doctors tested COVID positive who wearing the PPE kit Than small students was safe??😔 #MakeTerm1Hybrid #doterm1hybrid
1431574519781773312	And to add, I tested positive for Covid earlier this week and although I’ve felt better, I have two doses of this amazing vaccine to thank for my mild/moderate experience of this horrible virus.
1432284381851394048	My girlfriend nearly died in hospital due to a covid caused blood clot and spent the following month learning how to walk on her own again….. this was before she was even offered the vaccine! So yes Covid was the cause! Get the jab!
1485365620359237641	@juliairzyk 3rd day in hospital. Apparently, my “bad cold” (and 4 negative tests) was Covid. 1 week after improvement, I collapsed. Blood clots in both lungs.  Thrice vaxxed but immunosuppressed.   Also lupus. Not fun.  Stay safe.
1434932104132014084	"@TurntableKittah True but I think anyone who claims the majority of people presenting at hospitals are unvaccinated is selling something for 2 reasons:1) most people going to the ER/Hospital aren't there because of COVID2) vaccines don't prevent COVID19Didn't Rolling Stone ""quote"" a doctor?"
1468941643806089216	Just found out my nanna's in hospital with covid. She's currently awake and on oxygen, but keep your fingers crossed for her 😭🤞
1473332684059463680	Ok! I’m unvaxxed and today tested positive for Covid. Symptoms are, sore throat, headache, sniffles. Otherwise feeling fine.
1530107929038188544	@MLoParis I had my flu injection and then 6 weeks later I got what my doctor classed as “mild flu, definitely not Covid” he said if I hadn’t been vaccinated for the flu I would have had a stint in hospital like in 2016. My idiot Aunty was telling people I had Covid and Mum went nuts!
1376580032416645121	@BennettRayford @KellyMcGugan @Steven_Royalty_ As I understand it there's COVID-19 the virus and SasCov2 the respiratory disease.  The vaccines prevent 90% of COVID-19 cases and (so far) 100% of SarsCov2 (what can put you in the ICU).  COVID-19 is just a cold until it turns to SarsCov2. An expert can correct me though
1449835786057261063	@MevrouS @Im_Pacho @dTumza @Melusi_MD You obviously don't know how vaccines work. If you're actually interested I will explain.Genuine question from my side: If you end up very sick from covid, will you go to the hospital or will you still rely on your immune system?
1386732261664514056	@Cernovich @dreday712 They count heart attacks as a Covid death if that person has tested positive ...but I’m sure they’ll blame this as a Diabetic related death with no mention of the vaccine/Covid.
1471938730898432008	@DOOS13145143 @NoSkillsGaming3 @z00tymanda @samstreetwrites @YronDukeMDCCCXV I really hope you don't get covid, and end up in hospital and ask doctors and nurses who risk their lives to treat people if they are bad people yes or no. Are you going to do that?
1463059239530754050	i have so much respect for minhyuk honestly bc that man literally had covid and was in the hospital for DAYS and yet somehow had the energy and motivation to gym at ungodly hours to look absolutely shredded for this cover
1434887168305123330	Pray 4 me gang 🙏🏽 Done tested positive for COVID
1463284707903385605	Said a prayer to God before my covid test that went something like “if this test comes back positive and I can’t go to the 24 hour party at nowadays on Saturday I will literally kill myself, amen” and then my test came back negative
1433494658118787073	777 people recorded as dieing from Coronavirus in the last 7 days. I would like to know 7 things. Age, vaccination status, other serious conditions, died at home, in Hospital or elsewhere, how long they had been ill, had they had Coronavirus before &amp; what variant was it? RIP.
1430165714967535616	@GSmokesweed1 Good Morning, or good night I should say. Another night in the ICU done...so many vents....so many COVID patients. Exhausted. Have a good day.
1432358682671603716	I tested negative to covid even though I got a minor cold but the ppl who didn’t take the vaccine got tested positive lol
1502741784715218945	@Luke_Hallam Hi Luke. Apologies but I tested positive for Covid today! I took a test yesterday and was negative,  so only just come on
1422169139968417794	@nuwandiss I just can't fathom how you can not care about passing Covid-19 onto others, that could mean that you are the cause of someone dying, being seriously ill in hospital, or having long Covid! Just such a selfish attitude to have!!
1481449445292085248	Tested positive for Covid lord please be with me and protect me through this time! Looks like I’ll be home watching college hoops until next week 🤩
1531039222911709185	Lol I just tested my water (for real) for Covid and it was positive!!!! Lol
1450677061912236038	I fully expect to see an announcement soon that states that Travis Tritt has tested positive for covid. It's already apparent he has tested positive for stupid.
1414995806629896198	I tested positive for covid on Sunday after getting a notification from NHS covid app saying I'd contact with someone who has covid. I live with 3 people and none of them got a notification I tested positive. How accurate is the app?
1505109420820221952	@RichardBarrow I have had covid symptoms for a few days. Slight sore throat, headache etc etc. Only just got my positive ATK test last night. People are walking around spreading covid and still testing negative. They serve no purpose whatsoever.
1576599916914544640	@Captaincoby00 I know two ER doctors, both still wear masks. I asked why, their answer: they are see more and more people landing in hospital with severe Covid - including those triple vaccinated. Until we have an improved vaccine, all it’s doing is preventing you from landing in an ICU.
1436462003850252288	@ReneeAlida But yet the vaccinated are the ones in the hospital now from covid.(the lie the media is saying it's the unvaccinated🙄🙄) What's the point in taking it, if you can spread it anyway🤔? make it make sense...oh I forgot, you can't.
1482623331677483010	@TheNelson111 @zeynep @dylanhmorris Do you work in a hospital? I care for pregnant women “tested positive for Covid”. They are sick. With Covid, not pregnancy. All of them are “under 50”.  People under 50 don’t usually go to the hospital.
1522989336664457216	It's balloon day and...I tested positive for Covid just the day before😢 so I gonna spend my birthday in isolation. https://t.co/pmQL8ScYff
1388521051437555716	@SunSentinel “As of Friday morning, about 3,500 people were hospitalized for COVID “ I guess we will not get an update from @cindykgoodman right @FrogNews ? https://t.co/Fqt94p4UWI
1352997294510125061	@WorldStarSpicee @WORLDSTAR Larry was hospitalized, Well it's called a legend. I didn't regret from the past after taking covid vaccine, He's 87 years old.
1472525307945144324	Ok sorry to indulge my hypochondria on main, but has anyone tested positive in the past week who had covid in September? Wondering if I will have any immunity from my recent infection…
1506541767952412686	5 MO ago, I had COVID. I was resuscitated &amp; flown out. Thank God I got monoclonal antibodies. I had a horrible fog with it. Was home alone &amp; didn't know I was sick. My lungs are really bad I require 6 L of oxygen I required 20 in the hospital. I miss singing in church.
1479715957723439106	@DFS_India @nsitharaman @FinMinIndia I Tested positive for covid19 yesterday and I have only been to work at bank  and now my family is at risk. I wish we had a security guard or personnel to implement social distancing. Bankers are being sent to nuclear war with sticks
1527907711110684672	My last full day in Cannes! Gonna write my last diary, see the Ruben Östlund and go to The Godfather on the beach. Oh yes and get the Covid test I need to re-enter the U.S. tomorrow. If I pull a positive I get stuck in the South of France, which, now that I think about it…
1480659987730993155	So uh..Got very close to people in corridor last week because they are too small, these scum didn't wear their mask and were diagnosed with Covid+  stuff I can't tell or it would be d0xing myselfBut rn I'm feeling a lot of ungood physicallyHope I won't disappear in my sleep-
1406600126102114304	@Basebal30274341 @jbicha @TerrieG633 @bri_ece @nypost Gonna need some sources on fully vaxxed plus 2 weeks, caught Covid &amp; died. If it happened, I bet it is way less than 1%. Nearly all hospitalized Covid cases right now are the unvaccinated.
1454793224401326084	Trumps minions prove on the daily basis they are Absolute Total morons If he should ever contract covid I hope he doesn't go running to the hospital begging for help just lay on the floor crossed his legs and put his hands behind his head and wait it out
1599515745133637632	@RuralFMPA @drgygdmz5q @AlexBerenson @JeromeAdamsMD I don’t know where you’re from, but I’m from MS. I was in FL working when Covid hit, then in PA. I was in emergency room both places, they said it was nothing. When I came home, I was still struggling. I was admitted for Afib that was overlooked in both places. Now being treated.
1457985493132529668	@TheHuggingSonic @GMB I’m a nurse myself! And I speak to the ITU drs and nurses EVERY day . Every person in icu with covid IS vaccinated!!

1518307452604846081	Retail is really a sick place. 4 people on my team tested positive for Covid within days of each other, and the “HR Manager” was more concerned that we weren’t set up for a corporate visit we have tomorrow…
1381058169128935424	when i wanted to hang out with rei at alas i had to go to the hospital bc i got a centipede bite and it gave me terrible hives and when i finally became a student at manoa covid hit before i could even sign up for classes
1373412967698591747	@ByDavidTeel As @LukeDeCock pointed out, VCU is out and ref Roger Ayers out after positive covid test. Very likely just a coincidence, but ... Ayers worked the A10 title game between VCU and St. Bonaventure. ... The cynic in me says keep an eye on LSU now.
1446464778633760776	@ALeighMP Fun fact: Between 100-200 United States Congress Members (plus many of their staffers &amp; family members) with COVID.. were treated by a colleague over the past 15 months with ivermectin &amp; the I-MASK+ protocol at https://t.co/icaebvCFnH. None have gone to hospital. Just sayin'
1433270269859270658	I now know personally a man who has died of Covid. I also know of a young woman who just had a baby last week. She tested positive and had to stay in hospital. Has yet to hold her new baby! Neither of these ppl were vaxxed. Sad
1404608840671272962	@sunlorrie I don’t believe for a second. That many people died of covid. Which strain? Did they die in a car wreck and test positive for covid in the autopsy?
1433436483516514306	If I got tested ever week for COVID for the past 20 months; I'd probably have tested positive for being very irritated.

1405808087131435009	@MorganPeteBrown No disrespect to the guests, and even less to Jared, but I will be waiting for you to return. These last two episodes were wonderful by the way ... Helped me through some tough hours in ICU, suffering from severe COVID. Hurry back!
1385301779047403522	Comment from regulator at @IAIABC ForumWe felt COVID presumptions were unnecessary in our jurisdiction because most denied claims for COVID did not actually test positive for COVID. I agree. This is true of all states. The presumptions were an unnecessary overreach.
1426230516659929088	@DearAuntCrabby @GovRonDeSantis It's bad in my district. I was sent home 1st day of school and tested positive for Covid.Multiple teachers at my school are out.I'm missing the first 2 weeks of school.We are less prepared this year then last year.People act like nothing is going on. Stupid Flori-duh
1482919446390140929	Can someone help me understand the @OREarlyLearning or @MultCoHealth rules regarding a positive COVID case in a pre-school classroom? How long do unvaccinated kids have to quarantine for? Does a negative test after some number of days mean kids can go back to class?
1333263323438211072	Ol boy just tried to play me and say “if you not in the ICU don’t worry bout the Covid vaccine” BAYBAY don’t make me present my nursing accolades on yo ass
1506438190571429890	Nana had her usual one kn95 on when she was brought in. She didn't spend too much time in ER waiting and was brought straight to the private rooms area, so I hope she didn't catch anything. Will be on covid watch and concussion watch.
1382325918480367619	@OJIBAJO Someone I love is in the hospital w/ COVID &amp; pneumonia bcuz 2 of their employees went partying in Atlantic City, came back to work sick &amp; refused to go home. They had no policy to force them to leave. Had to call a board mtg to refuse them entry as it escalated the next day.
1344751290157559814	@pettycommajared Jared, I usually agree with you. But as a frontline healthcare worker who had covid 3 months ago, ive gotten quite ill from my first vaccine dose. Ended up in ER this morning. Was it as bad as landing in an ICU? Of course not. But it's not crazy to want to hesitate a bit.
1441520651312025600	Damn glad I didn’t stumble into Louder than Life tickets, homeowner where I’ve been working since Tuesday tested positive for covid today. Groovy…
1416709013685694465	tw // covid-deathThe media chose what to be served to the public. Bc one man died horribly in my house area. He is +ve covid and was about to get into his car to go to the hospital. But he accidently locked himself in it, police declare it caused by heart attack. His body only
1475843388066996224	I know a LOT of people who have had Covid, none died or even went to the hospital.I also know a LOT of people who got the vax, none had adverse effects.Covid is a thing, but not as bad as MSM says.  The vax is not great but not as bad as some say.  Both are over dramatized.
1486949968900288512	@Lexdollyloo I really never was worried about covid. I might have gotten covid when my roommate tested positive. I felt a little sick for a couple days, but I never got tested.
1345804593226252288	I can’t get my vaccine until spring because I tested positive last month (but was asymptomatic.) I got an antibody titer drawn today and the levels are so low that I basically probably have one lone antibody fighting off any potential covid that dare enters me
1560462753403351042	@EricTopol Had covid twice. March 2020 (no vaccine) and recently in April (3x Moderna). First time was rough (almost had to go to hospital but didn’t/pulled through). Second time was easier but became clear I had long covid. I’m fuzzy (especially language) and still dealing with exhaustion
1425592068135657475	My fam lost their momma to covid but were still hysterical as fkk abt the vaccine I saw them a month after she passed and just wanted to chill out and be good to them. Now my tio is in the hospital w pneumonia. All the kids are sick and the 5 y o had a seizure.
1370965510658138114	Okay I hate Lilly with every fiber of my being, but this is the option my rheumatologist suggested if I ever test positive for covid before getting a vaccine. Otherwise I’m pretty much a goner without it #COVID19
1384192445122895885	The amount of people that call into my job saying they tested positive for covid after getting the first vaccine....alarming. You’re not immune just because you get the shot loves. Still take the necessary precautions.
1377976018221330432	@davidnelsonORL Why would there be a significant drop off though?? Seems like there's likely a lot of flu cases being diagnosed as Covid... Maybe not anymore but certainly in the beginning. What other explanation is there? That's what I'm asking... Death rate is the same.
1376589473845293058	"I really don't think it's helpful at all to dramatize a so-called ""fourth wave"" of the pandemic. We should be concerned about variants, yes. But we're halfway to herd immunity w/ vaccinations and most people who test positive for COVID now are *asymptomatic.*"
1386170824911065093	if anyone is wondering where i got the information about the positive covid test.
1527409894105677825	my at home test says negative but oscars was positive so i have covid #slay
1412162867856564225	||• I hope to return on Wednesday if my covid test comes back negative 🤞 not sure now though because I'm feeling very hot. Not sure if I'm just being paranoid now or if the test will come back positive 😅
1387179881151225858	@SecondGentleman Getting COVID and not wanting to repeat the experience. It was awful and I didn’t even end up in hospital.
1386053335904575488	@MattCollis1 @KingBobIIV well Mr Matt, U R definitely 1 of those divided. while keeping the NHS for covid19 patient-statistically about 8k young women due to die coz they haven't been diagnosed in time. my story is about Labral tear that could lead to osteoarthritis &amp; I didn't have even x ray appointment
1387485548986634241	@AlicePippa48 I got a surprise call getting me in for my first Covid jab, and then my ADHD assessment went amazingly, so I'm now diagnosed and have some medication to try and help! It's been a weird, buzzy day but things feel hopeful at last :) #NotAloneTalk
1379167230298972161	@CallMeDougan @BorisJohnson_MP I doubt that 20% of all those infected with Covid require going to hospital.You're also completely ignoring (as is the CDC and WHO) boosting ones immune system (mineral Zinc, Vitamins C &amp; D3), as well as out-patient meds (including HCQ).
1414964294886768646	@SteveBakerHW I had a serious reaction to my last two flu jabs and ended up in hospital twice. I was advised by my doctor that I'd more than likely suffer the same adverse reaction to the covid jab. Where does that leave me? Do I chance death to be part of society. 😥😥😥
1547787630724517889	Whattttt😵‍💫 I’m tested Covid positive ???? First time in 2 years of this pandemic shit 😭
1571929715836870656	@fermalife I am very thankful for all of the essential workers, but especially to all of the medical workers who are still risking their lives to care for the sick and in particular to the nurse who took care of me when I was in the Emergency Room due to Covid complications.
1363809114825105409	@LeukaemiaCareUK @ProfKarolSikora Strangley , I got to High Risk Stage 4 CLL, diagnosed at 56 in November with No symptoms at all , still don't.  Treatment is going fine , had vaccine , then Covid...... but bloods are improving and no side effects.
1475150693996584964	Covid is running through most families I know and my partner just tested positive.
1472711924844482565	@mny_mrk @Breaking911 I had covid and wasn’t hospitalized... it was a 5 day cold.So shows your immune system is just as effective
1371091474591416323	@MessMakerPro @RonSarkar I have two people very close to me in the hospital fighting Covid, one of them is in serious condition. This can be a horrific nasty disease. What you don’t want is this virus. You will do fine with the vaccine, a day of discomfort  will keep you alive and well.
1443773127935234057	@Michael97134866 @SParnis What about the FLCCC docs? They have developed &amp; improved their protocol for all 3 stages of COVID, it's especially important for those in hospital, or with long haul who can't get a vaccine, to be honest, you also shouldn't get it in the 1st stage. I hugely respect them
1383879238231543809	@ltgrusselhonore @CDCDirector @POTUS @DeptofDefense Too many people DEAD from #COVID19  Since 2007 my husband had a triple heart bypass. Two knee replacements. Carotid artery surgery. Sepsis in ICU for 2 days &amp; in a room for 7 more days. Kidney failure. At NO time did he know what meds went through his veins. #VaccinesSaveLives
1469396483258601480	I am Pissed I keep passing these covid test. Damn I need a positive one so that I can go home.
1428364140637085701	@SuperDuperSJW Reporter confirmed “that the person was hospitalized in the state for ivermectin toxicity, but it is not clear whether or not the new patient was a resident.”Really? I wasn’t aware there was a problem with idiots flocking to Mississippi for dangerous, unproven COVID treatments.
1473838950645059584	@_yoarianna I’ve had Covid, my natural immunity is superior than anything the government wants to jab me with. Covid vaccines are all a money ploy. I’m more like to end up in the hospital because of the vaccine than actually getting Covid.
1380190435210096645	"@ZubyMusic I would wager a guess that the timeframe is not a hard and fast ""guideline"" for establishing a Covid death. Wouldn't surprise me at all to find out that anyone, at any time of having a positive test ""died"" from Covid."
1372668226266656769	We have 19 people out because of a covid exposure in the ER and I'm the only tech working tonight I am going to lose my God damn mind.My shift just went from being 12P-12A to 12P-6A and I am not mentally prepared for the shit show this is about to be.
1358847293156450310	One of my favourite humans is currently in hospital with PIMS and it's devastatingly difficult for everybody going through this with covid restrictions. Please stay at home where possible, wear a mask, wash your hands, and get the vaccine at your earliest opportunity.
1388271860844875777	To give y’all better insight since the news will always tell you cases are rising.....At the hospital I work at, only 2 patients with covid, neither whom are in ICU.Go outside and get your social life back.  Just be responsible and wash your hands.

1483790427945844736	@IainMulady @Toby8282 @EssexPR @freddiesayers First vaccine was administered December 8th 2020. Funny, I visited my old work place today. Run by agency workers. One had to leave this morning as they tested positive for covid. All 35 cases before I left were in vaccinated residents and staff... go figure..
1426521879200731136	85 hours since my Covid test. No result.I expect it to be negative. But are there positive people out there waiting just as long for results?
1524777672177553414	My husband’s boss tested positive for Covid. He’s out, of course, but was in their (small-ish) office yesterday. Hubs is double vaxxed, single boosted, and tested negative today, but I’m pretty concerned, not gonna lie.
1420179142067335170	I wanna know how the hell clubs have guys playing games without knowing the status of covid tests. Finding out the results of a covid test in the middle of the first inning and then getting pulled cuz it’s positive is abhorrent. They let him finish the AB and run…. https://t.co/8cV7UwG2xh
1374430762162778112	NEW: The Speaker of State Assembly @CarlHeastie has tested positive for COVID-19. He’s already had one shot of the covid vax.He says: “I am currently experiencing only extremely mild symptoms. I am in frequent contact with my physician and look forward to a full recovery.”
1389032207088594948	@sbstryker F*ck moderna. I got my second dose April 9 and was diagnosed with covid yesterday. 😡
1381959925216186373	@NHviking I was tested positive with an Abnormal test, they still submitted me into the database as having covid. Meanwhile 3 days later Negative!
1481669700295737348	@AstroKatie I work in a hospital and I can’t even begin to tell you the number of people that show up to the ER with COVID symptoms and pull down their masks to talk or cough 🤦‍♀️😡
1361421433985900546	@photo_charisma @GeminiGuy290 it scares the hell out of me when I get the flu vaccine I get the flu horribly bad if I get the pneumonia vaccine I end up with pneumonia in the hospital I just can't take the covid vaccine that scares me to death.
1468742798308515841	Still shocks me how the HC122 coronavirus bill took powers away from the coroners to sign deaths off and gave it to doctors without conducting autopsy’s and writing covid-19 as the cause of death without a positive covid test being carried out. Did everyone forget about that 🤔
1476832216923652096	@sweetmytye Got my positive results yesterday after not feeling good for three days prior and was finally able to get up and go get a Covid test done. 😩
1384979580516249603	@mpk I'm in one of those risk groups despite being ~healthy, and thus avoided armjab for a while. I realized it'd be really dumb if I got covid and showed up in the hospital and the doctor incredulously asked me why I was waiting.
1380986115864342532	My poor dear nan got hit by a bus this morning. Then she got run over by two cars, a steamroller and a lorry. Then just as she was getting up, lighting struck her - FOUR times. Sadly she died in hospital this evening. I fucking HATE Covid ... 😡 https://t.co/3mRbSbdDhV
1386114969435918339	@nursekelsey I gave vaccines to grateful, hopeful patients here in NH! After a year of fighting COVID in the ER, this is my healing 💜
1357071432568700930	Exactly a year ago I went to the hospital for an extremely swollen neck and some unknown virus. Today I’m getting my first covid vaccine. What a weird year
1444443993832443904	@XonRonPon @zebrazyra @VicGovDH Yeah that’s true. Like when I was in hospital a week ago my roomie for one night was talking to me about how he has been in hospital for 4 months with pneumonia and he thinks if he gets covid he’s done.
1472068311739355138	@KilljoyJSC ??? I provided you data from the San Diego Dept of Public Health, with info from local hospitals.It supports what we are seeing across the country… that nearly everyone (80%+) hospitalized and dying from COVID is unvaccinated.Choose wisely!
1381771447148769281	@spectatorindex I heard from a local source that over half of the ones suspected of covid received a positive test. In other words, this number has to be significantly higher
1397627080590909443	@tr6_guy Covid is a form of flu. Since colds and flu are technically coronaviruses. If you tested someone for Coronavirus and for the flu, I bet both would turn up positive.
1478757187824480258	@chrisalecanada Have you ever live a time in your life when the TV tells you 24/7 for TWO years that if you have a cough or sniffle you may die?I had Covid during holidays, and with the sore throat and shallow breath on first day i may have checked myself to hospital if i didn't know better...
1431362013142388739	i jus tested a watermelon 4 Covid19,the results come back positive 😅 🚮
1544989462010408960	Really?  Lockdowns caused a reduction in natural immunity, and that’s why everyone is sick?  Really?  Lockdowns?  Then why are those in hospital with covid 38x more likely to be vax’d, than unvax’d? 🤷‍♂️. I wonder 🤔 💉 💉 💉Seems some are more susceptible than others. https://t.co/95UOicUjWX
1370514195209453571	@AlTea84125134 @BrowseMode @dashford77 I wish! I thought it might stop me from going to hospital. Admittedly, the probability of me getting very ill with #covid is very very low even without the vaccine. Most people I know who had it didn't show any symptoms at all. Despite that I feel safer for having been vaccinated
1443579736878321681	@WesElyMD @DrEricDing @CIBScenter after getting covid (very mild in terms of what I was expecting) I was diagnosed with Ophthalmodynia (jolts and jab syndrome) 2 months later after getting increased migraines. The only measurable difference in my body was the presence of covid antibodies.  GET VAXXED
1420990617107132423	@Jim_Jordan I work in a federal workplace. We get email updates on +covid cases of our workforce bi-weekly. Throughout the month of July more vaccinated workers have tested positive for covid than unvaccinated workers. This administration must stop incentivizing this vaccine. Mask up.
1418490015374462978	Tested positive for COVID-19 2 months after my last dose of vaccine. So far, I only have mild symptoms. 😊
1373302595436081153	Please can all these cnuts sign away their rights to NHS assistance should they test positive for Covid in next few weeks. You muppets your timing is crap.just in time for Easter and School holidays. I wish they could just build a wall around London, Mayor and all
1481701449532854273	My flatmate has tested positive for Covid.Bollocks.
1481050299389612032	@SkyNewsAust It is full of lies. He is not a child. He got tested and confirmed COVID positive on 16/12/2021. Don't tell me he was not informed about the test results. He is an unscrupulous and very self-center fella ('Me ONLY').
1422759265492770817	Well, I tested positive for COVID this sucks.
1424924223961665541	@LennyDykstra The Covid vaccine is not without side effects. I suffered a pulmonary embolism and spend 3 days in the hospital. Could have been fatal. thanks #ModernaVaccine
1575632887491481600	@modooborahae OMG IM SO HAPPPY!!!! I had covid over a month ago and I was so afraid I'd still test positive (I don't know how long it lasts)
1474768799060664325	@JacksonHealth From my understanding this is a milder strain but highly contagious. Can you share the number of people in the hospital because of Covid?
1478064224777740294	Just was off work for a week and a half for Christmas break and I just tested positive for Covid so now I’ll get another week and a half off
1429080216681521152	@kallmemeg @0bj3ctivity So I just got home from an early in a&amp;e-40yr old foolish non vaccinated man-on his way to ICU-couldn’t see his lungs on X-ray! His wife is vaccinated at home with covid - guess who will die?
1507953060613541889	The world is burning, close ones are Covid hospitalized, but I’m choosing to take the pleasure I can find in the #Bridgerton pall mall scene existing outside of a novel #malletofdeath
1384885176308744193	@TheAdmiral2153e @Joy_Dawkins @BBCNews For the uneducated, the vaccine does not stop you getting covid, it does however stop you potentially ending up in ICU at hospital. You can still catch it. Think on. I vaccinate and am an HCP with the background knowledge so masks unfortunately will be the new norm.
1530142207755407360	@InfiniteCyclus @jebuschristffs @newscientist What? I don't understand what you mean, can you elaborate. What it means is that it's so more severe than the flu, that covid cases are 7 times more likely to get hospitalized for it.
1380367375309148161	Prayers needed.. my longtime coach Joe Negrete is in the hospital battling Covid. He is a very special soul and prayers are needed for him and his family. 🙏🏻
1347152959117926406	My Covid vaccine is booked for 11 days time! Didn’t realise you can’t have it if you’ve tested positive within the past 4 weeks, January is still fab though!💉
1393068090686984192	@_ssprince I know. I just told you both cases. If you haven't been corona positive and neither you have symptoms then you don't need to test for covid before vaccination.. but a doctor will tell you better.
1380496581884047362	Well I can’t go back to work till 17th since my nephew got the Big C 😂😂 and that’s if I don’t test positive but Ik I’m good last test I was negative tho I might have taken it 2 soon bright side I do get Covid pay
1479726353557569536	My money is on Derek Carr getting covid. He’s probably unvaccinated so he was tested recently and he was positive. Mariota is actually the better QB.
1473112543983857666	we’re really heading head first into another wave of death and disability and the only people who seem to care are the dying, the disabled and those who know them. if I get pulled back into working in ICU, ED and the COVID wars again I’m going to lose my mind. I can’t do it again
1456028580157267969	@WhatGoingDowney I had 2 Moderna vaccines 1st jan 16 then feb 19 for second. On August 9 I became ill with fever and other symptoms. Lo and behold Covid +. I was sick but not hospitalized. It does happen
1434565186518614020	@incessantlycur1 @BooksnCoffee042 Lol, sure you did. They had a test for COVID in January ‘20? Thats new. I was actually in the hospital in March of ‘20, and there were no tests available, not even for the staff. Maybe you were in China, bur you don’t seem like the “I have a passport” type.
1515077372214611974	@Paul0lauP @WellingtonKofi @earnmoreeasy @DrJamesOlsson No they got the sever covid after the vaccine. Both of them ended up in the hospital. They both regret getting it now. Because I never got Vax havnt masked or stop living my normal life and have never caught covid or anything. They have been around the vaxed and both got covid
1446539538990567454	@hansenplumbing1 @LittleSenator Hospitals are now releasing the number of covid cases in their systems. One of the hospital systems where I currently live has 7% of their hospitalizations of covid from vaccinated people. Meaning 93% of people who've been hospitalized, are unvaccinated. Pretty huge difference
1465916104082079745	@HaferlandEric @v1llag0mez @VolumePrintcess I had Covid before anyone knew what to do, had to sit up to sleep for a week due to difficulty breathing, I survived. Now everything is being diagnosed as Covid, combined with all the fear from msm people are sabotaging their own healing process by being fearful &amp; thinking worst.
1532612097057562629	@Johnnyflight4 @gmbutts You know, I've seen the ICU over capacity 3x in 10 years, all during the COVID pandemic, 95%+ unvaccinated, 0 cases of chickenpox. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen someone hospitalized because of chickenpox personally.
1592781618582020098	Someone I know tested positive for #COVID19 yesterday yet today he's standing closer than 6 feet, wearing no mask around people who don't know. 🤷🏻‍♀️

1378005533345644548	I don’t like that my job isn’t taking the proper COVID protocols. It’s really worrying when they’re making me work in an office with so many people who have recently tested positive in here.
1485466042906595330	"@Larry_D0g @damienmgrant I think you are right. We haven't had widespread transmission, so we haven't had random people turning up to hospital for something else, getting tested, and then dying in hospital ""with COVID"". Our numbers are a truer reflection of the overall mortality rate in all countries."
1376019356874772485	Extremely angry... my ref partner from hockey tested positive for covid. Will this crap ever stop? I’m so damn upset. When will they fix this crap???

1405129125510234120	@JeromeAdamsMD I’m just saying that it doesn’t seem like the chance of getting hospitalized with COVID is that high, since the beginning of the pandemic, I have not been sick with COVID and I don’t know one single person who has had it,
1369558875440054272	@Dempz8 You may have seen a discussion i had on your thread about this. But this is the reality. People will accept that those who test positive and pass have passed because of Covid-19. But not if they have tbe 'vaccine' and then pass. It's crazy.
1422330158292275202	@SNELLLY07 @JUSTTHETIPAGAIN @Jym_Shoe I recently had covid &amp; recovered at home. Never went to the hospital or the doctor. Just to a drive thru covid testing center. I have zero comorbidities.
1475469194753982469	Got a mountain of cheese &amp; a room full of wine ready for the family to arrive.Just tested positive for #COVID19 (although I feel tip top!).This means I have to lay on the sofa watching TV, eating cheese &amp; drinking wine without the noise of screaming kids &amp; in-laws.Gutted 🤥🥳
1480172293200527363	Hey, SPN fam, can you please pray for my husband Mike? He's been admitted to the hospital with covid pneumonia. He is my world. He's all I have in this rotten world.  #spn #Supernatural #SPNfamily @jarpad @JensenAckles
1436150855393165313	Again…..my employer requires everyone in the office to be vaccinated and prove it…every day one or more tested COVID positive…it was so much, they had to shut the office down again and send them home……we have thousands of employees……#VaccineIsNotWorking
1374883822450401281	@LucidWhim @Diamondtrees11 How totally ridiculous. So sorry Fiona. I’ve had a couple of run-ins with folk in the last 48 hours about the issues with cancer treatments being stopped. So sick of hearing “it’s not contagious” or “they might die if they catch covid in hospital”. So little proper understanding.
1450104862625214476	@LyleVieanne Starting to feel more normal now! Had to go back to bed for a few hours this morning which helped Must say I would sooner have this than be in hospital with covid! Thanks for asking
1388525406798585856	@CopDisaster I wish i could have admitted here When i was tested positive They all will fight covid and back to normal life Har har mahadev 🙏🚩
1602342140989816833	This weekend, I tested positive for COVID for the first time during a routine test. Fortunately, because I am fully vaccinated &amp; boosted, I have minimal symptoms &amp; am self-isolating. I encourage everyone to get the most updated booster &amp; remember that the pandemic is not over.
1515863193012289547	I got vaxxed. Had double pneumonia Covid. A week in hospital. Shortly after had heart attacks. I’m not saying they were connected but I’m 75 never a day in hospital.

1430894098458636289	@UFC2025 @WhyAreYouSoMad_ @BMC24k @jroc967 @Bease11 @iAirDry My risk is obviously way lower than someone without it, but the more unvaccinated people there are means more of a chance for a variant that isn’t as protected by the vaccines. Plus, the more people in the hospital for COVID means less attention for other patients…
1388914914035519491	I’m vaccinated along with half the state. In the Hospital they’re just using a surgical mask on non-Covid units then throwing them away at the end of the day (like they should). I’m over the “N95 for every patient” policy in Home Health. If so then give me a new mask EVERY. DAY.
1384755975245209600	@dapperlaughs I know a Covid victim in hospital who's on one of those Dyson ventilators. He's picking up nicely.
1388504292949209089	This is crazy af bro. These Mfs rather my test come positive for covid than to have that other shit 🥺☹️
1383625080672964613	@Kalaax008 @LindsayPH I don’t think I would consider Covid a deadly virus.  In my personal life everyone I know who has had it said they had worse cases of the regular flu.      I don’t know anyone who has been hospitalized let alone died from Covid.
1517628397266034688	@TheRealJackieJ @kezia_noble My wife is jabbed + boosters and I am unjabbed due to medical reasons - we holidayed 4 times a year pre covid.We are that stage that we need to get away but I am stuck here.I was positive for Covid through the Lateral test but never took the PCR - wish I had now for the proof !
1527042623218716673	@eezeejoe @endoplasmic_uk @BerryTartlet I'm reading the same thing. If there are no manifestations, then doctors do not report it as COVID 19 Disease. Doctors decide if COVID 19 disease is present. This document does not say anything about reporting based on a positive test alone as you claim.Following is from sec5.4 https://t.co/zEfitWofyg
1442662399186649090	@IainMulady @carlheneghan @UniofOxford I see what you mean, but I took that specific language as superfluous since one would have to catch COVID to be hospitalized and/or die from it.  If you're right, the disclaimer needs fixing for sure!
1430626957461491719	@empathicpolitic @therrienv @jarjarbinks @POTUS Um, not a single person in the city where I live has been hospitalized for COVID. 3 people died during this “pandemic” so it was coded a “COVID related” death. Cancer, liver failure, coronary &amp; all 3 in their late 80s .. but they all died from COVID. Uh-huh. 🙄
1548394719083782145	I tested positive for covid 😔 I’m feeling much better but being stuck inside sucks
1531801840408485890	Fuckkk I tested positive for covid 🤧 symptoms aren’t that crazy but yesterday I was down baddd
1402980902645420036	I insist that people who have tested positive for COVID-19 should only take medication which has been prescribed by a doctor who has spoken directly to them and taken a clinical history. There is no one-size-fits-all COVID regimen.
1375535426476376068	@tinamarieshaw @LettingFocus @Nick_Pye @FatEmperor Yes, overwhelmed where I live, one patient with a positive cold/covid test. But that is out of 210, 000. Hope they are not worn out.

I told him the other 2 in the family admitted to hospital as they had no jab.He then told me that I had passed on covid as my first jab was a govt infection jab to kill🤔
1511906429770387464	Have tickets for both the 8th and 9th, but I guess the universe doesn’t want me to go see the boys. Tested positive today.  Fuck you covid!!#PTD_ON_STAGE_LV #BTS #ARMY
1382928225152634881	This is what you say when you have no clue about demand, supply, pandemic, emergency, government's duty towards its citizens, citizens' rights or the emotional state and plight of someone diagnosed with COVID. Commies never fail to amuse me.  🤦‍♂️👇
1503414233341517827	I'm going to hospital with Covid.
1546267761675993088	@kevhamm There will be problems if I don’t go to work tomorrow. Unless I have covid, I’m in a car wreck, admitted to a hospital (preferably in the ICU), or deceased (and these are the only exceptions) I better be there.
1351602694453133312	@jammzin Unfortunately it’s not in the governments interest to keep a list of ‘people that died within 28 days of receiving the vaccine’But they do have‘People that died within 28 days of receiving a positive PCR test’ counting as a covid death. Aaah why do I even bother.
1436302589721784340	@CarmineSabia I already had covid. 101° headache annoying cough and sinuses. The flu gave me 104° and had me coughing up blood. Bronchitis put me in the hospital. If y’all are afraid of a slight respiratory disease then you need to recluse and let everyone else live
1614114390713991168	@robbystarbuck I recently spent over 24 hrs in the ER and, of the 15 Covid cases in there, every single person was vaccinated, usually multiple times.
1478048698684751873	The at home test came back positive today. I’ve managed to avoid COVID all this time until now.
1476719952593924109	WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME FOR A POSITIVE COVID TEST THAT I CANT EVEN GET FOR ME TO STAY HOME AFTER IVE BEEN EXPOSED TO SOMEONE WHO TESTED POSITIVE
1384055647302340616	I have tested covid positive and my family members too. Post covid recovery I pledge that I would donate plasma and would encourage others too to do the same. In the times of distress we all should come and support each other.
1436386615644020745	@brewmeone That’s why her tweet was unproductive. I highly highly recommend people get vaccinated. The science and data seem clear to me. Proclaiming your “I went to the ER with covid after being fully vaccinated” does nothing to get people fully vaxxed.
1407104560234221570	#BillyGilmour is asymptomatic &amp; has therefore tested positive using a fraudulent PCR test so he hasn’t got Covid. There, I’ve said it.#EURO2020
1461647729785032707	@unhealthytruth hmmm.  i am not vaccinated and i got covid and i wasn't hospitalized.  I wonder how much worse mine could've been if i got the shot🤪
1602134196801110018	@77_steeze @PeterHotez I think this is a reality &amp; it doesn’t have anything to do with disinformation.  Drs did nothing for covid patients sent them home with nothing,   Told them to go to hospital if they got really sick then put them on vents &amp; remdesiver - killing many
1377178978549555203	@Bump74 @WestHam @Benrahma2 I was just thinking that 😂...maybe he forgot to tell the gaffer he tested positive for covid the night before.
1387434345753886723	@benshapiro 🦠Coronavirus says: “I never promised that everybody would recover much less fully recover from me; that they wouldn’t have to go in the hospital or that they wouldn’t have to go on a ventilator; or that they wouldn’t have to file for medical bankruptcy afterwards. That’s Life!”
1480905199724240898	@CVParkerinnov8 @Billius27 Where did you get the info to support this? From the beginning children weren't even getting infected. I have yet to see a single teacher go to hospital and the school thing... would you all get a clue. NONE of you got covid and if you did you got a little holiday.
1474288214735085574	The manager tested positive for COVID. I did some in-home tests and came out negative. Gonna test again in a few more days, hopefully, it stays negative.
1485796746387202052	@IAmJericho @FOZZYROCK I need lots of prayers. I had to go to the ER today. I tested positive for Covid. I scared to death. I am thankful to have gotten my shots. I am lucky my lungs are clear and I’m gone. Everyone please be safe out there.
1480564103831646208	Got covid tested yesterday cause my mate tested positive and I saw him two days ago and I'm starting to get some symptoms really hope I'm not positive 😩
1488127299178405889	@nadhimzahawi Shouldn’t this read “I’ve had my three jabs and therefore have tested positive for covid” ?
1437064304033947660	@BvGroat @DjRedBroad @SculptorViv @Raynerc113 @Peston Large numbers of over 30s have ended up in hospital as Delta has spread so quickly, even ICU. This is also well worth avoiding. I don't fancy a spell in ICU, personally, or getting Long Covid.

1367209401040461836	I need my vaccine. I will be getting vaccinated. I signed up for text messages from my local area about when I can schedule my appointments. I’m not willing to risk getting covid and dying or ending up in the hospital. If I get it, I’ll feel more comfortable with the vaccine.
1380358405819338752	I'm sorry, the Canucks have had *how* many people test positive for COVID?
1345402010250711041	Just got what will hopefully be my penultimate covid test. Hoping I'm positive so that I can begin to put this behind me. It's been a long two weeks... and we were spared the worst of it. Let's get that vaccine out!

1460245682225352705	@ZoePrecious2020 I no one who has just had booster and admitted to hospital with Covid.
1423234027591503872	I literally did this weeks ago when I came down with a cold. I went to straight to the hospital to get a covid test after a few days of having it.
1394642564590997505	@chipperhc @itvnews Indeed! Here’s an example. I infect you 5 hrs before your incoming #pcrtest, you land and get a test 48hrs later. Both times shows negative results - another 24hrs later and you would show as positive and transmitting all around you. #fail #notravel #COVID
1477743590881349633	My partner has tested positive for covid. He's doing okay (knock on wood) but he's been sent home to quarantine. The place that's hiring me has paused processing new hires due to covid. And like, we're fine but dhfhdhfvgfbg this is a mess.

It's the fifth wave of Covid + flu on the rise +step A and lots of other viruses around &amp; you are taking mask protection away?Do you want more deaths this winter?I know someone who has just died after going in hospital with a chest inf got Covid twice
1570559690987425792	My wife is highly allergic to cats but loves to hold the cat we adopted. She also has some pretty serious seasonal allergies. We both had Covid last month, hers mild and mine was asymptomatic. She saw a new doc tonight who has diagnosed her sneezing and wheezing as Long Covid.

1429410231700889600	@ErrolWebber My unvaxed negative Covid tested student is getting kicked off his college campus for  2 weeks because he came in contact with a student who tested positive for Covid. This is now their way of forcing the vaccine down our throats? And what happened to privacy?
1471902350797250594	@stoolpresidente @BaileyCarlin Dog lol show me a stat that more vaccinated people are in hospital beds that’s the unvaxxed. Please show me that. Like what’s your argument dude? Bro hospitals are turning away people that need assistance because of full bed due to Covid. Vaccine keeps you out of the hospital
1502679864364646412	@IngrahamAngle Those folks not getting the Covid vaccine are the ones who go to the hospital and are the ones who die in the hospital.  Many ask for the vaccine, but at that point it's too late.  Is it safe to assume the ones dying are Republicans?  I think so.
1406529691356471299	I've just read that if you've had both vaccinations and been in touch with someone who's tested positive for Covid instead of isolation you'll need to take DAILY tests! Brilliant MORE plastic that can't be recycled (been contaminated with our germs etc)
1480622409287802886	@tinahaiser @NilsHeadley @aehemeter @EWoodhouse7 @JeanneNoble18 Assuming that's even true (HHS/CDC show 4 Oregon kids in the hospital with COVID), you're proving my point. Oregon has some of the toughest restrictions for adults and kids - clearly not working.It's been 2 years - maybe it's time to build more beds or hire more staff? https://t.co/hkuCGtEgyM

I got vax BC I didn't want to be disabled for the rest of my life. (between 25-30% of COVID patients, including even asymptomatic) That and I didn't risk bankruptcy with 6 weeks in ICU.
1445885034477481987	@MuellerSheWrote Hmm, I think they should have gone different angle with what it cost each person. Example: Hi I had Covid, was in ICU for 11 days, total hospital stay 16, total cost to me $345,876 dollars. And no I can not bankruptcy out of hospital bills

1475934309064318977	@AndyGlockner I have been fortunate to get information about covid and vaccines from brilliant doctors! I got all 3 vaccine shots including booster. I had a fever for 10 hrs, aches, sinus pains, fatigue and a headache but it is worth it to be proctected so I don't end up in the icu! #COVID19
1548408317445165057	2 years ago today I was admitted to hospital with a bowel stricture, I was in hospital for 2 weeks at the height of covid. I lost 5kg in a week and experienced the worst pain and panic attacks I've ever had. I am so proud of myself that I made it through that experience. 💪
1356863161522135040	@Julien__Cohen I simply will not be having the vaccine. It is experimental and we don't know the long term effects. I already have immunity from having had Covid-19 back in mid March and tested positive for antibodies over 6 months after.
1388857817885466625	Banning travel from India is racist right? So let me get this straight. India sees a surge in covid19 cases and their legal travel to the U.S gets banned while illegal immigrants who test positive for covid19 at the southern border can come as they are? Help me understand please.
1447704203531411457	The risk of me dying from Covid is 0.0038%. The risk of be being hospitalized is 0.0452%. These odds are tiny. There's greater risk to me of dying in a vehicle accident. https://t.co/ZWafoIH1lS

1429903218310631426	@TWLadyGrey @mitchellfoxtec Good well maybe you will figure it out when you are in the hospital with Covid since you are in such deep denial about it. Wake tf up.

1479324215421583362	@LitterickB @ksorbs I appreciate your message. There was no vaccine when I was in the hospital with Covid July 2020. Fully recovered. Antibodies are strong, I get my blood tested regularly. No need to take it now. Blessings of health and happiness to you.
1480377835835453444	@rnz_news I'd say doctors that tell covid + people to go home and islotate, and if things get worse go to hospital,instead of giving early treatment are cruel, and unfit to practice, which embarrassingly is most in nz
1382311237627867136	@Rachel__Bush Stop with your nonsense. Misinformation like this crap is THE PROBLEM. I treat COVID in the ER every night, from mild to critical Illness.  Not once have I had dangerous vaccine related illness. It’s beyond rare... COVID deaths aren’t. Your a model. I’m a board certified ER MD.

1387199180683235330	This is dangerous. Just because you're young doesn't make you immune. Me and my wife caught it she was fine at first i was sick (flu like symptoms) a month later she's in the hospital with heart failure and the doctor believed it was covid that caused it.

Imagine Hancock lied but the hosp were awful that mum was in. Wouldn’t let me speak to her for a wk. Very sad 😢
1473096287952248836	@DunaDamaris @Joshand85549878 @disclosetv It’s not unusual for hospitals to be full this time of the year, even before COVID.

1379997087069265924	@AaronCampeau Intuitively the answer is yes but the key variable is how much the virus mutates. That will probably never become an issue though as we’d get booster shots as needed. I feel confident in saying you will probably never be hospitalized by covid or its successors post vax
1389258322533040128	@cromgood @hellowolkenfeld @IAMSteveCox @RealCandaceO My stepmoms Dr is making her wait for 90 days after she tested positive for Covid, to get the vaccine. Apparently, getting the vaccine when your immune system is already amped up can cause it to overreact.
1570606716961820678	Even though I’ve tested positive for covid, my physical status is stable and most of the symptoms are gone now. So luckily I can still work on covering class materials that I would miss in the upcoming classes as much as I can on my own. Hope nothing bad will happen anymore

1425561222582349831	@SteveBurston1 @Robin_Blue19 Because it’s a public health issue. And they ate standing very close for a prolonged period. I had Covid and after two weeks of having tested positive and out of isolation I checked with the hygienist if she was happy. Good manners.
1382624992349855744	Returning to work after being diagnosed with blood cancer can be daunting, and you might be wondering:❓ What are my rights?❓ Where can I get support?❓ How does Covid change things?Head to our website for information, support, and advice: https://t.co/Y8OWm3YMDg
1377949107495428102	So it’s 4:33a &amp; haven’t gone back to sleep yet. Guess the JnJ vax isn’t a good sleep aid after all.Also just got a slight fever 99.9F. My punishment for making a dumb joke 😔Taking a covid test for another job tomorrow AM. Could I test positive for Covid now?
1427113948742963205	my kid has been in school for a week. as of today two kids have tested positive for COVID in the first week. they finna shut everything back down &amp; i just am so upset for my kid. being in the house has been so hard for her
1445129718265692189	@NewsHour @DanRather I had the vaccine while pregnant early in my third trimester as I work with high risk covid patients in the hospital. Both me and my 5 month old are doing well. We can only hope that as the years go on we will continue to be safe, I hope more people who are pregnant do the same
1483542842249261057	i wonder what’s gonna happen with at-home Covid testing nowhow do the positive tests get reported in?surely they can’t possibly believe people will actual report themselves as positive if they didn’t have to go to a facility to get tested
1490031329160962056	Latest view on England patients with a positive covid test currently in hospital, as of 8am on 05-Feb.The count is now 11,604, equivalent to around 30-Dec (i.e. 37 days ago), a reduction of 1068 (8%) in the last week. https://t.co/aglyBuorU5
1375121267473448964	Based on our kid’s positive Covid test, we will need to quarantine until April 7th, unless my test comes back positive, then it’s possibly a few days before that. 🥴

And definitely didn't walk out of the hospital in just a few days, haha. Maybe He had the kawegistaanse version of Covid🤣
1407654100691529732	@jeffmwerner1 @mikeyjwins @justaguy1766 @washingtonpost The only person who has exposed me to Covid had the vaccine so she figured it was okay to go out while coughing and sneezing.  Had to call me the day after our meeting to tell me she had tested positive for Covid.  Who are the dumb people?
1465209251350077445	If i go for a #COVID19 Test &amp; its positive, would they be able to tell me  which of the Greek Variants i have: Beta, Delta, omicron? Would they be able show me, x ray machine? #COVID19 #4thWave #OmicronVariant
1528048514986520577	GAH!!!!! One of the people at my work conference tested positive for COVID so we were all exposed. *sigh* First home test negative...thank goodness! I've been up and working for about 3 hours so far.  After my work call in 8 minutes, I'm done with work until Monday.
1348806580213526531	@TheSportsDrop1 I just read NYT says Gorillas at San Diego Zoo tested positive for Covid.  Bet they get the vaccine before I do!
1342239949928673281	I went to get my COVID vaccine today at a local hospital. I was there roughly 20-25 minutesDuring that time a code blue was called in the ICU. A sobering reminderStay safe everyone. Merry Christmas
1476737148808093696	@hueysr @evilbryan @Sportsnet Of course . 80 people died of covid .... So , what you meant to say was 80 people died WITH covid , because of underlying ailments.  I know a few people who've been in ICU for covid, all 3 had underlying health issues. Why isn't there more emphasis on a healthy lifestyle?
1378035753884782597	I’m really shocked at the amount of people who have let up on mask wearing and maintaining social distance. Here in NWOhio we have over 1000 cases of people in the hospital with Covid. I don’t know who needs to hear this but it’s NOT over yet. Quit slacking! #COVID19
1488552543437434882	One thing that scared me during covid (also made me cry a little) was the thought of getting hospitalized and mama not being there with me.Meri maa k bagair maine kaise thek hona tha
1351310340093603840	@Stat_O_Guy I tell you what’s bothering me, this vaccine doesn’t stop you getting covid so therefore you can still test positive. If you then die from whatever reason you will still be classed as a covid case and death. Or just me overthinking and wary of this government’s tactics!
1384210856204931083	@jimmyfallon Easily, my wife deserves this title. She didn’t know she was pregnant until five days before she delivered. While waiting at the hospital, she tested positive for covid. After delivering, she suffered a kidney injury and spent two weeks in the hospital recovering.
1480640822089601029	@BennyXFortune @JustinTrudeau Agreed.  I work in health care. Many vaccinated ppl are getting Covid now; some are in hospital too. The ones most vulnerable to severe illness /death, are still the elderly and sick. Boosters for them might make sense.. But will make NO big difference for the general population.
1430275545779027981	@Hrts4Zourry AH YAY IM GLAD !! WELL TO BE HONEST IT WAS REALLY SHITTY I TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVID AND I FEEL LIKE IM GONNA D!E &lt;3 BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS OKAY my irl is bringing me ice cream and brownies so thats good :))
1378113562825138177	@Napoleonkjp1 @dontbetyet That’s me and my husband, I had covid( with symptoms) and positive antibody test. Husband had no symptoms and negative for antibodies 🤷‍♀️
1431283839117058048	To the person who are tested as covid positive,...Get well soon love♥️ you can make it ....you can fight this!you got this!... remember, you're not alone! May God cherish you with health and love. You will be fine. Trust me. I love you
1476123475437780992	Ugh I am really fucked off about this DJ Dickhead. My husband has just been in hospital for 12 days (non covid related) and we've been in our own personal level 4  because the last thing he needs on top of what he already has is covid. This is exhausting.

1513945745799458829	@Mike_Fabricant @BorisJohnson Just to let you know that in my school the staff room was closed. I worked my lunch serving and supervising children as staff couldn’t cross rooms. I did this whilst my husband was in ICU with COVID @ICT_MrP @MichaelRosenYes @secrettory12 #ToriesOut
1503332931783196672	@erfbeeass Oh no! Not Covid I hope. If yes, then please get back to hospital. Your recent lack of mobility makes you susceptible to Covid pneumonia. Take care.

1378020583066238981	@ClayDowling @penny_jensen @matthewt_ny @RubleKB @JustinRohrlich Also, I’ll tell you where the flu has really gone, nowhere. Anyone with flu symptoms  are given a Covid test and absolutely are positive for coronavirus which has been around for years . We havent been able to get rid of the flu for over 100 years &amp; a new virus makes it go away?
1379075940177747968	@JimUSA1776 @min_forDeviance @HegKong Yes. It could find that I had a cold 4 months ago and they would say I test positive for covid. It’s ridiculous. It was created to produce high numbers do they could declare a pandemic. Period. It’s all lies.

1559599017784393729	@JackPosobiec I'm confused.  Weren't we told over a year ago that once you have covid, you may test positive for up to 90 days, thus the reason they stopped testing so much?  Is that not a thing anymore?
1476918570105937938	18 adults &amp; 7 teenagers for New Year's Eve...dinner made, drinks ready, wine chosen, fireworks bought. Unfortunately we reckoned without my wife's positive Covid test this morning..she's about the only person I know who hasn't had it already! NYE now in January#notgoingout
1554593852622864385	@CovidHse Can I ask, what about a mid 30s gent who was boostered 1 month ago who had a heart attack and tested positive for Covid upon entry to A and E... He died. Is that Covid????
1459252396438134784	@LoriLovelace16 @Gialde @disclosetv I know this whole thing is such a joke. The pivot from you can’t get Covid when vaxed to expect to get Covid but won’t be hospitalized was absurd? Wasn’t the entire premise of the Pfizer study it’s effect on preventing infection? Was their even data on “lowering severe cases”?

Hospital numbers don't support anti-vaxx assertions. I think you're all liars.

People are dying so high official tell the truth stop trying to politics this. Go to China and fix it.
1431026039270961152	@ashdabashsmash @CNN @CNNOpinion I do agree ppl are misdiagnosed, but speaking to medical experts it seems like it would benefit from taking the vaccine. But again that's your choice but my main point is that it you're in ER for covid care bcuz your choose not to vaccinate, then that on you.
1475965276881625096	Wanna laugh? So I have to move this weekend bc it’s the only time ima have help right, so I photoshopped a positive covid test to call out of my part time but then the manager hit me w the “with our new 5 day policy, you can return to work as your scheduled :)”

1614412650728882178	@pmcdunnough @CastAwayOne1 @knotthatone It was determined early on, that the recovery rate was around 99.7% for Covid.

1426240237659951106	I agree with this, if you don’t trust science enough to get the vaccine then don’t go to the hospital if you get Covid. It’s the same science that would make you better
1422754358572290052	@lillium__ @Real_MrBill @sbjames2327 @thedailybeast We didn't know in the 80's and frankly, yes you are if you are bleeding.  My point is, we don't have enough good data. And the data we have now is biased. Did you know they stopped testing  vaccinated for Covid19 if they are not hospitalized. That would skew the narrative,
1484717815558856710	@BradWilsonGOP  local control until Utah gop disagrees.  I wonder if you and your cronies have set yourselves up to be sued by anyone in summit or Salt Lake County is diagnosed or dies from Covid. Seems like y’all think your doctors now ?
1612212306036809729	@CogNerd I’m currently COVID +, my 3rd infection. Different rodeo this time… a lot of GI involvement in addition to the upper/ lower respiratory crud. Test result showed within 2 seconds of exposing the strip to the Binax swab. Quickest positive yet. FLCCC iCARE protocol worked.
1548946167794663426	@tax_oz @Ryan_stephens57 @grazinggoat66 I had the same experience,  had to have a test in hospital (nothing to do with covid)but I had covid, not that sick with covid. The staff were amazing but the process over the top.
1412927179680141316	The Delta Variant (COVID 19) is here.  I know 3 persons who have it and they are suffering in the hospital.Get your COVID Vaccination and stay protected.

1543855760148496384	@GillyLishman @ManicMyna @JujuliaGrace Therein lies the problem.  Most of us look outwards at the real world and can make sense of what is happening around us.  I'm not vaccinated and have never tested positive.  Might have had covid, but if I did it was very mild with no lasting issues.  I look after my health.
1434947429594501123	@AshleyGWinter I've got you one upped.  Mine went out of the way to keep his appointment despite having a fever, loss of smell, shortness of breath... AND... best of all, a positive COVID19 test.
1462609336925048832	@chris_notcapn These are not used in hospital settings, my doctor uses one at his office. This is not the test we use before intubation during Covid. We’d use an arterial blood gas.
1480177309349036034	@agooding58 I can’t stand him! He was out in peoples faces the same day his Covid test came back positive. I hate people like that.

It is not my responsibility to educate you on the global pandemic. Your choice to ignore the evidentiary science available is your own issue.
1384889598380232704	@TedNugent now you know what #bipolarclub go through. I experience what you experienced every 3 to 4 days for fucking years or since 2/5/18 when I was forced to the hospital by police.#Mentalhealth #COVID19 https://t.co/brD7TxN8Bn

Lemme think on that &amp; get back to you
1536878666738565120	@alexmeshkin Don’t worry you’ll catch covid before long. It’s been around since 1954. Get vaccinated. Just got over my second positive test. It’s not as bad as it seems. If everybody had it at the same time it would be over.
1388586689493405698	@cooltxchick I had an acquaintance, a older man in ralatively hood health, who caught Covid &amp; tried Hydroxychloriquine first, &amp; ended up in the ICU where he passed away a week later from Covid pneumonia. He was posting on social media until the day before he died. SMH

1480661125314318339	@DoctorLunge @toadmeister So why is natural immunity not being talked about and ignored. I have had covid, had a positive antibody test, so must have t-cell protection. Yet I am being coerced into taking a vaccine when I don't need it.
1404418865250013188	I know everyone is burnt out. Just wish covid cases is not as high as now. Oncall in icu is very tiring. So does on call in other departments. Praying hard for complete total lockdown so that we can all go back to our normal life as before.
1434861355224518660	@Acosta Medical personnel who are assigned to make triage decisions have the most difficult job I can imagine. I do not wish death on anyone.I do feel that unvaccinated ADULTS who, for no certified medical exemption, are in the hospital for Covid 19, have already decided their own fate .
1381598631606677507	@YardleyShooting I had covid symptoms (flu) 5 year's ago, I was in ICU for a week &amp; nearly died! I would have been treated for covid today instead of a deadly flu! I have chronic ashma &amp; weak lung, I haven't worn a mask for months, no slime on hands, lots of hugs &amp; not a sniff!
1446969639599329283	@Huskers Tested positive for Covid today.. gave my tickets to a fellow teacher. Cheer loud Husker fans!!!
1488570924714455041	@tinlizz I have just seen way too many 'healthy people' have serious long COVID issues. The body builders I know caught it twice. Alpha &amp; Omicron versions. She was pregnant when she got Omicron. She stayed in the hospital and had the baby early, because of COVID.
1387183845720707077	@Sananto18608029 @LBC @TomSwarbrick1 I work in an NHS hospital. Many believe only the aged catch &amp; die of #Covid. Most serious cases in ICU units are middle-aged. Elderly are often not selected as they're too weak, with little chance of survival. The young are also susceptible, as in #India.#UK needs its vaccines!
1418724094791593991	@switzer_cheryl @JesseKellyDC Same with me in NJ last May (which was supposed to be prime time) and I had the whole place to myself. They had a Covid wing set up in the ER, but no one coming in. Then in Jan I got Covid and had the monoclonal antibody treatment and I was the only one in the Covid section.
1416468100090843141	@HSJEditor The daily hospitalisations are doubling every 20 days; the total in hospital due to Covid are doubling every 13-14 days. So I’m hoping @CMO_England misspoke and mixed the two up…
1373332324079824910	What’s the point of these Covid Vaccination cards if we don’t need them for literally anything. I feel like i should be allowed to visit family in the hospital at least
1576974687925841920	@CastielsHamster Did I say covid is a hoax? I literally said that I was in the ICU due to Covid.
1528714512475488256	I hate to do this but I have had a positive Covid test and feel like utter garbage so no stream today. https://t.co/XwMl8k3Y35
1511576505910194177	This day exactly a year ago I was in and out of consciousness &amp; breathless feeling like I had forgotten how to breathe, on my way to the hospital, worried that I wouldn't be coming back home. A year has gone by, but the damage covid did, physically &amp; mentally, still haunts me.
1478315399565434882	I’m back!! I ended up having to take a few days off since I tested positive for Covid. I’m feeling almost 100% and am ready to bring you the latest in the bitter cold coming our way in the next few days 🥶 https://t.co/uFhtpm2IVP
1373177436356104194	@DrEricDing People are not always told they have one of the variants when  they test positive for Covid. Why is that? It seems to me, if people understood how contagious the Covid variants were, it would help stop the spread. When will we know how the vaccines stand up to these variants?
1417943654728179717	@14ReyRey I’d guess that they are producing COVID anti-bodies (in response to the vaccine or an actual infection) which is getting picked up by the PCR test as COVID positive. If they are symptomatic, it might be a coincidental respiratory virus (e.g., a cold).
1485651496142311427	i don’t wanna hear anyone say their tired of covid if they aren’t vaccinated, don’t wear a mask, aren’t careful when going out, or stay quiet if they’ve been around someone who tested positive. you are literally the problem.
1419374352684957709	@IanM1871 @burlygiant @PHE_uk Your telling me that nobody in the pubs had covid at all at any time just cos lat test says negative does not mean you are.Its spreading cos people are unaware they are positive till they feel sick but by then they have infected dozens.
1390753618412793858	@narendramodi Respected Sir, I would like to inform you that Pandemic Covid-19 is over now, means people who were tested positive with Corona Virus infection are now 100% free from this infection and illness caused due to this infection. Please inform people about this.

1483890742015803396	@instatuviae Yea, me too, what is Covid? A name given to every Illness now to cause fear and hand over control to those seeking power. It’s a farce. I tested “ positive”

1390343749864144905	so fucking pissed i then tested positive for covid🙄 now i gotta cancel my Florida trip🖕🏽
1381450276851355649	@TruthseekerLori @wocoyle @JennaEllisEsq I’m a nurse and if you’ve had the vaccine it will not show up on a test. They are not injecting you with COVID. It’s MRNA technology. If you’ve had COVID already for 90 days after you can test positive. But receiving the vaccine will not effect a PCR test.
1345774380274638848	@OllyPenis @KirstieMAllsopp Rare?! I've had flu twice in my life. I don't personally know of anyone who's died from it but know it happens so have my invited vaccine. However know quite a few people with covid, including a headteacher. I also know people who work in hospital. Rare?
1446574606853287936	@MrShuggoth @Motwera -- Heck, when I was being tested for COVID, I was quarantined in my room and told to wear a mask when I left just in case I tested positive (luckily, I tested negative on both the rapid and lab tests). My family knows how serious COVID is, but we've heard reports of --

1465938820801732611	So I went to well now. And they sent me to the ER. So, apparently my #gallbladder really wanted to hang around #covid patients ALL DAY. And apparently it wants a new doctor.  Because it’s been acting a fool since Saturday night. https://t.co/H5Z2vtVmpE

1389275366137675779	@MarisaKabas A woman I know spent a month in the hospital with COVID on a ventilator. She posted this on IG (this is a screen grab of her total...FOR 1 BILL). She said there’s another $25k or so from individual doctors. Yes, $728k...they want their $393k ‘please pay now’. Unreal. https://t.co/HFp34IUMuO
1344336696532369408	@CAgovernor @GavinNewsom @cvspharmacy @Walgreens I work frontline at a family practice in a medically underserved area. When can I get the vaccine? We are seeing all the covid patients who are not sick enough to go to the hospital (aka a lot), yet we still have not gotten it and covid cases are about to spike again.

1483842184801619971	@ChadGoldsmith @MyasthenicT1D @BlueRiptide2022 @MartianPontiac @michaelmina_lab We should be testing every person every day. And jail those who test positive. I bet COVID rates would crash in weeks if we did that.
1446841507873394691	@toadmeister @KMD103083 They SHOULD be fired. If I’m sick and I go to the hospital the last thing I need is to get Covid from some idiot nurse who doesn’t understand science
1392254576368275456	@VeronicaSam13 @EnseySherwood Exactly. My family members who are doctors and nurses warned me to be careful. That COVID19 vaccine reduced chances of being hospitalized. Unfortunately, new variants are mutating through anti-vaxx and COVID-19 denier populations.

1422641731288326150	@capesandcovers I sent the test for another reason, I was in an area where someone was confirmed covid positive , and I had a test lying around from my old job that I never needed to use, so I figured I’d sent it
1375198095852638218	Had my second covid vaccine yesterday. It triggered an asthma attack and I had to go to the ER by ambulance, so, that was fun. XP I would please like the drug cocktail they gave me every day thanx. Breathing was easy for a few hours. I miss it. XP
1430224706410528775	@dragonfan817 @CypressEd @Mizzou_Cards_NO @Chocks @zcdaub @MattWalshBlog I don’t disagree with that. I’m anti mandate also. But Trump also encouraged vaccination and was vaccinated himself after being previously infected with Covid. I tested positive last year also, and decided to get vaccinated. But that should be personal choice.
1412715334847635459	Few lads who were at the do Saturday have tested positive for Covid🤡. If I had Covid I would be going to the do tonight and Sunday (🤞). But I wouldn’t know I had it, because I’m not a fucking mong. #StopLockingYourselvesUp
1579543114905419777	I get that hospitals and doctors serve a very important purpose, but my personal experiences have repeatedly intensified my distrust of them. I just wanted to see my primary care, but since my symptoms are too covid like, they demanded I come to the ER. I don't want to be here.

I would have gotten the shot already had I not tested positive for it but i understand my natural immunity and am not anti-vax. So this something you should be proud of
1553034414212481025	I’m worried. I woke up this morning with the same feeling in my throat I had when I was positive with covid. My test this morning was negative but it’s exactly the same 😭 and my asthma is really bad
1418608912064925696	@MdFacep @NBA Yes, but you could still test negative, come back &amp; the next day or two days later test positive bc incubation period is up to 10 days.

1376274075753005063	@Starscream35 @billshoemaker21 The mild sickness you feel is because your body's reaction to a vaccine is to trick your body into creating antibodies.  What I felt from the vaccine was absolutely nothing compared to the three weeks I layer up in the hospital with covid

1415587828055085059	@samanthasrants @Theolady4 @spikedonline The last 20 people I know who have got Covid (with symptoms and have been quite ill and have not just had a positive test) have had the vaccine and most of them both vaccines. The vaccine does not stop you getting Covid or passing it on but it does come with awful side effects.
1473694759780814862	@delaunois_larry @im_winzane @OccupyDemocrats That's not correct. I know three vaxxed who died. Eight of the 11 people I know who have COVID are vaxxed. Two of them are in the hospital. You vaxxed are the super spreaders of the virus AND misinformation... Like your tweet above. You aren't invincible.
1563964494350495750	@AliMae0515 @TheExtraFiles @DominicMoss13 I kept thinking lymph nodes were just from ebv activation or long Covid cuz everyone has them too mine were Pretty huge by time they diagnosed me my whole spleen was full of cancer lungs stomach etc
1438516411308003328	@lefefer @bigsound56 @SamSneed2013 @dubsndoo @AdamJoshDotCom The majority of people that get covid have mild symptoms similar to a cold or flu and they recover just fine. Some don't even have those symptoms, like me, I lost my taste &amp; smell &amp; that is all. I guess David thinks I should have went to the ER &amp; asked 2 b put on a vent for that.
1376954498250207234	@thomaskaine5 Just got my 1st dose this morning. I will wear a mask until 85% of the country is vaccinated. The vaccine keeps me from needing to be hospitalized but it doesn't prevent me from gettin covid or spreading it.
1366565341661388803	@Its_me_Yemi @BLeighHoward I’m doing a lot better! I haven’t been tested since the positive but my guess is def. COVID free! A little more than 90 days out now so I’ll be getting the vaccine soon.
1531314540591210496	@EmbryEthan Let me say, in my multi-generational home, 6 have covid. 3 had tests at urgent care and are reported. 1 had a positive home test and informed their doctor. 1 had a positive test and didn't report it. 1 hasn't tested, refuses to test, has all the symptoms (also only one unvaxxed)
1545871599294943234	Was a little concerned cuz I was not shaking this lingering sore throat from the Covid symptoms I had.  Went to urgent care and diagnosed with laryngitis now.  Ughhhhhh! Treating it now and just continuing to rest up this weekend.
1288220687908261889	@HankIngram @davesizzle @AlexBerenson And, if you have just gotten over the cold, you can test positive for Covid because the infection from a cold has the same anti bodies as Covid...I do not trust the numbers they give on Covid deaths. As for the vaccine...I don’t believe it will be a safe one...
1377063164462952448	@sarahkliff So I don’t feel good, go to the hospital for a Covid test. Should the hospital waive any charge just because I had a Covid test? I mean I took a room from someone else, possibly a life or death situation, but I went for a Covid test that I could have done elsewhere.  CPT codes?
1552508584591777792	@foreveaendeavor Yeah, and she admitted it was a misunderstanding. In fact, that conversation ended on a friendly note. Idk how I belittled him. If that was the case, why did he keep checking in on me after I tested positive for covid? I advised him to get his anxiety meds changed or increased.
1449810604445765633	@CBCAlerts After Hinshaw’s PR debacle last week we need clarification on what constitutes a Covid hospitalization or death. I would wager that many of the people in the reported stats were admitted or died due to other issues but had a coincidental positive PCR test.
1426401043689078784	@GeorgeTakei 1 bed left. Patient 1: 39 yo Unvaccinated. Now in ER presenting bad oxygen levels.  2: 74 yo. Healthy male. Stoke symptoms. 3: 9 yo. Unvaccinated. Can’t get it. Got Covid. Presenting bad oxygen levels. I know my priorities. 3, 2, 1 Why is that bad?

1473456370385104899	My whole house (partner, two kids, and two cats) still haven’t tested positive for Covid.We don’t have symptoms because we’re not sick. Thank goodness we’re all unvaccinated or this could have been much worse.
1431742195204231172	What?! Here’s another one. I was just trying to find journalists who died OF Covid.I quote:“former BBC Farming Today presenter Richard Sanders has died at the age of 62 after contracting COVID-19 in hospital. It is unknown why Richard was in hospital.”😳https://t.co/ZzrNeIyUBe
1467566344241664013	@Klova_5 @MissB1112 @redpillpush3r @JedediahBila What? My God. You are in complete denial. No, children admitted to the ICU because they have Covid are in the ICU … for Covid. How do you not get this?

This isn’t 1000s.As for masks, every review tells you that they do not stop the spread of viruses!I’m afraid you’ve shown yourself, despite the figures, to be a Covid hysteric!
1482778457713131524	day 3 of a having covid. Took another test to make sure it wasn’t lying to me. No it was not. still positive. thought i was feeling a bit better but he said sike b tch and now i have the most brain splitting headache and ear ringing i’ve ever felt. just finished crying over it 😁
1383309983165517827	@ruskadevushka_ My wife goes to hospital, Wednesday, for Total Hip Replacement surgery on her left hip; but for COVID, it would have been last year. The cost to us £0.00. UHC should be a right in all countries, not just some. I hope you are beginning to feel a lot more like your old self today.
1563651628489740289	i say this as if i didn’t just include a picture of my positive covid test in my post https://t.co/6vHKlG0tfi

1501435742274338817	@Jordanfloyd__ I don’t get to go I went to get the Covid test thinking it would be negative and it was positive I’ve been a hot mess all day I literally hate everything
1443616555636596741	if my covid test will be positive i’m going to eat that whole bucket of caramel popcorn while i can still taste anything https://t.co/QoSJGwzv0j
1480582299703992322	I apologize to every patient who tested covid positive and complained to me that paracetamol it's not enough to get off the arthralgia and I kept saying to him no it works I'm at this situation right now :)#CoronaPositive
1470779150013276165	I tested positive for covid this morning, like seemingly half of Westminster...
1412083349456310275	@missy_131 Someone I know hasn’t had the jab but got a blood clot in the lung after going to pub to watch football, diagnosed as covid. Has been taking steroid injections in shoulder before going to pub though, any Dr before today would have seen the link between steroids and blood clots.
1597921680579387392	I had my 5 th Covid jab 🥳today 🥳🥳🥳 vaccinations WORK 🥳🥳🥳 over a 6 mth period I had close contact with 3 family members that tested positive 🤔I didn’t get it 🙏🏼🙏🏼🥳When I leave my house I Wear a MASK 😷 Be SAFE everyone, DONT Take risks COVID is Not over 🤔👇👇👇👇👇💙💙💙 https://t.co/yffmBDHtiA
1434861746238464000	@Cheryl1572 @JillB513 @Sorrell_Lab And you still don't have a good answer. I won't end up in ICU. I have human ivermectin prescribed by a human doctor to be taken prophylactically and at the first signs of Covid.
1460778392278736899	This all comes on the heels of me having Covid earlier this year and being hospitalized. And over the last two years, we have buried over 10 people in my family. Lord, have mercy.
1477509164209430530	@JEDBPK @Angry_Staffer Truth. Most caps were for $1-2 million lifetime, and I'm seeing hospital bills now in the $5-7 million USD range for Covid. That many zeros freaks me out. ECMO, transplants, and months in ICU aren't cheap.
1444348284949172226	@GovKathyHochul Respectfully, I encourage the State to take up the goal of urging NYers to get fit as well as vaccinated. CDC from March ‘21: An overwhelming majority of people who have been hospitalized, needed a ventilator or died from Covid-19 have been overweight or obese.
1481085570390634497	sooo my area is out of rapid tests and everywhere that offers tests are appointment-only and they're booked for like the next week. but without a covid test showing positive i still have to work. so should i have caught it i would be spreading it regardless bc these states suck
1376149439094603776	@cheerfulcabaret @Dr2NisreenAlwan @dgurdasani1 @Know_HG @ClaireHastie1 @NidaZiauddeen @YaoGQ I got diagnosed with Hashis 2 years ago and the virtually all the symptoms on long covid are what you get with hashis levothyroxine is only good until you get your next hashis flare. They symptons are so debilitating and I understand what long covid sufferers must feel like.
1424966224308539392	CDC: Nearly *1,600* children hospitalized with COVID. The number of children under 5 yrs old with COVID *tripled* in the first half of July. I'm sure current stats are worse.One child hospitalized w/ COVID is one too many. Children *must* be vaccinated to return to school.
1476934250507210756	@John_P_Carvalho I have a home test and a pulse oximeter if you want to use. Full disclosure-the home test I used said negative when I was positive. My Covid presented with cold symptoms, fatigue, and headache. I’m in Opelika so could drop the goods off or meet you
1339684408262062080	It’s been 24 hours since my first dose of the COVID vaccine and I am feeling great. Just some arm soreness from the shot. Had a full day doing procedures in the hospital and taking care of patients. Feeling fine like any other day. @MdAtlPermanente @KPMidAtlantic @LifeatVHC https://t.co/rDNf1Tweza
1358498223929909249	@below_level @dawnteo @unterdengingko @HelenBranswell But better than going to hospital and better than dying for sure. I think most people would take a few days off to get it over and done with and then be thrilled to go back to normal life. This assumes of course that Long-Covid isn't a possibility after having a vaccine.... ??
1393512236673638400	If you’re in hospital with any variant of Covid because you didn’t take the vaccine then I’m sorry but that’s completely on you. https://t.co/wXsMGenJzU
1473401730406756363	Kinda feel like everything being open is a bad idea right now. New Orleans went from 150-something cases to almost 500 over the weekend. And I don't believe this includes the number of people I know who tested positive for covid at home.
1428174223231516679	But just to be safe- went through the Covid test site, honestly thinking nothing of it. Went to work because I still felt mostly okay- took some DayQuil, wore mask at work- still mostly felt normal. 24 hours after test, results came in. Positive. Not what I expected at all
1427910923314814978	this nexus of information about covid is really getting out of hand, i have been receiving calls with various symptoms which are far from the described DOH symptoms and that’s not the worse of it all, imagine this people kicked some hornet’s chest once they get to ER.
1541474159502544903	Really sorry guys I think my streaming for this will be put on hold as not only have I tested positive for Covid but so has my little one again really sorry but I hope to be back streaming soon #ENVtuber #VtubersUprising #Vtubers #gamergirl #Streamergirl #Streamer https://t.co/FwN9OOdne2
1443236485143142401	@denise_dewald I'm very upset about this issue. @HoltPublicSch in Holt, Michigan is allowing (keeping?) teachers diagnosed with #COVID19 in classrooms.Now, teachers are contracting the virus and spreading it to the community via transmission in the classroom. I'm immune compromised. 😟😠
1414676139956649987	@rtenews I’d rather this approach than that announced by Johnson today. A bit less turnover for pubs &amp; restaurants but fewer people in hospital and getting long covid. In 12-14 weeks, the whole country will be vaccinated.
1412101459320131585	2 weeks before we open up, managed to avoid COVID and isolation and go into work every day then @CS_312 and @smithyRL2000 get a positive rapid test result 😔 I blame Southgate for this, definitely picked it up watching #Eng
1503903544482885632	Pulled a hernia @ work yesterday, fiona Stanley hospital put me with covid positive patients cause I wouldnt do a nasal rat test. No fever, no symptoms, not my reason 4 being there.Fiending for cases much.
1520452496933621763	Thank you Seattle for having the foresight to protect yourself, love ones &amp; others. This made me so proud. This is why when I ended up in the hospital and needed surgery they didn't have to turn me away. Thank You Gov. Inslee for your quick response to Covid, you saved many lives
1509057505388867588	"So let me get this straight. There is a record number of people in hospital with Covid, yet DRoss using his vast medical knowledge, is calling for the government to end the requirement to wear masks ""in certain"" places. Where would that be Dougie? Intensive Care? 🙄😷"
1483981437653110785	I thought vaccines were developed to prevent catching the virus. So many positive cases of the “FULLY VAXED”.  Sorry, you still can not go to work because you just tested positive for Covid 19. I understand you are fully vaccinated.  Apparently it doesn’t mean much.
1481834599437193217	@DebbieBowie10 @SpeakerPelosi Fake data sorry.  They already admitted fake numbers.  Admitted because of covid or just happened to test positive for covid.    Also where are the at home treatments ?  Are you telling me that we have millions of drugs but not one is prescribed to work.  Wake up.
1481465457865539584	"LETTER FROM SCHOOL:""Good evening Families. I am notifying you that a member or members of our school community have tested positive for COVID and may have exposed others at school.""CHECKS STATE SITE NEXT DAY:Dozens of new cases recorded yesterday, 3X the number the day before"
1488790350043009024	@UKLabour Have you heard of Corona Virus and the morons who are in hospital and who don’t believe in the vaccinations? I wouldn’t admit them as they don’t believe in the virus and something to do with the Conservative party!!!! As for promises what about the Labour Party promises. Corbyn ?

1483262078827724800	I think this cycle of closing the gym and opening the malls is creating a negative result cause more people are going to be coming into the hospital with other reasons related to mental health and further comorbidities and COVID is worse for people with many comorbiditiies
1433525515336380417	@ValorLeaks No my favorite group got diagnosed with covid i'm not fine 😃
1385384795837026310	In the course of a week I’ve had to deal with Mum having a health scare that landed her in hospital (she’s out now and on antibiotics), a coronavirus scare post-Mum’s hospital visit (tested negative, thankfully, but she’d had a fever and dry cough so we were fretful)...
1435288617430093829	@Mominsweats @kaitlancollins 1. Why do you leftists continue to spew this fake news about horse dewormer.  Nobody is being prescribed that.  They are being prescribed the human infection treatment version of Ivermectin which has been used for decades.  Two people I personally know were hospitalized w Covid..
1481033541542625281	@Sammysmom15 Chances are good that all stats reported in OK are numbers FAR BELOW the real numbers.

1431132418526756868	@LibbyforJustice @Angry_Staffer It is a therapeutic for treating people who have tested positive for COVID. I presume a positive test is required to get the $4,000 infusions.
1398257511866810374	@AmericanAir I find it so disgusting how you guys will not refund my flight! My roommate tested positive for COVID and my trip has to be cancelled! I'm on unemployment and could really use the money! I am utterly disgusted with how you treat your customers!
1479163712812380160	"Anyone else tired of this line?""I did everything I was supposed to do, vaxxed/boosted, masked, socially distance, avoided large crowds... and I still caught covid.""Then they add: ""I'd be in the hospital or dead if I hadn't.""🤦‍♀️"
1459650134963331077	@chipfranklin I think $200 is CHEAP considering the average covid patient that has to be hospitalized costs are in the tens of thousands of dollars!
1473558324096421893	@kylegriffin1 Please tell me how regular citizens know if it’s Omni / Delta etc 🤔 When you get a Covid test , you are only told positive or negative, same with at home tests
1376631607520600070	@RedNhappy3 @L0ve45 My understanding is that the vaccine does not stop you from getting Covid it just stops you from having it so bad your hospitalized or die.
1436798212149493762	@pcrclaims I’ve seen a lot of tweets by people who were extremely ill in the hospital after catching Covid, but are sure they’d be dead if they hadn’t gotten the vax 😂😂😭😭
1452077361625772047	@InkstainedFox03 @pureblood3691 @NototyrannyNOW @grayphil27 Wrong.  Viral pneumonia is more prevalent,  but less likely to be diagnosed due to a more benign course.Stop pretending to be a medical expert.  Go work in the ICU and treat a covid19 admission.  Call me when you don't know how to turn on the ventilator.
1429688110611316737	@AshleyClaster @SpectrumNews1TX I didn’t send mine. They have been pulled for this year. I refuse to let covid come into my home here. Jobs no longer have covid protections, you test positive, your home two weeks no pay. We can’t afford to loose our home because the school district can’t keep my kids safe.
1339289489185918976	I had the privilege of getting the #COVID #vaccine. I thought about our patients ravaged by this illness in the ICU... and in a rare moment of #hope, the momentous culmination of decades of painstaking hard work that got us to this moment. #ScienceMatters, and it’s the way out. https://t.co/vhNtzYwPlk
1476244506412564485	@catladymom24 @CTVToronto Last I checked people under 20 have the lowest risk of being in ICU &amp; the lowest risk of death due to COVID. 19 deaths in nearly 2 years is statistically lower than that of the 2018-2019 flu season in that same age group which stands at 34 as per StatsCan. Our kids are safe. https://t.co/nebsJhBWBE
1562607034528571392	@jespergarm @JohnsonBragg @CmcChapman @JordanSchachtel I know of at least 2 people in my real life, obviously that won't work for you, I have read plenty of stories of people saying their loved one was healthy and got covid and went into the hospital and died of covid,  guessing you won't believe those stories either.
1527582457813696512	@MrJonCryer I'm currently laying in bed on day 5 of a positive covid test.  I'm vaccinated and boosted.  My symptoms are on par with a sinus infection.  So while the symptoms are minor it's becoming somewhat unbearable. Things don't seem to be getting better.  I can't sleep.  It sucks.
1390645193729216514	If you can't provide a test report why are you doing Covid test at Airport.They took my sample on 03/05/21, as on date still I don't know whether I am tested positive or negative.#Covid19Odisha #Jharsuguda Airport#CMOodisha
1388595073110183941	@Fulwellendbogs If I’m in ICU with Covid, then it’s because I’m vulnerable: either old or with a health condition where I should be shielding. So that means I’ve taken risks with who I’ve seen or going out. I’d take responsibility for that. Aren’t we supposed to take personal responsibility?
1509752321869180930	@j_mcelroy So what time length do they figure Covid can survive in waste water?  Scientifically speaking...  Curious of the science... As I have seen and can provide the lab, that held a stool sample for a year and still tested positive.
1368364738325970944	@GovPritzker @FamilyCHC The vaccine. This has been one month and a half since I've registered with the health Dept. I have underlying medical health conditions. Not proud to say I've been tested positive for COVID on January 28th. I need your help please. Health Dept is not responding.
1444980201121742848	@JamesLamancusa I am recovering from lung cancer surgery and an #unvaccinated nurse could have killed me. Right now, the goal is to protect the vulnerable and I’m guessing 90% of people in the hospital are sick enough to get #Covid_19 even if they’re #Vaccinated#DeltaVariant #VaccineMandate
1378039766021632002	Happy my job takes covid seriously however if I’m fucking negative after 7 days of exposure why can’t i go back to work? if I consistently test negative, have no symptoms, or have no contact with positive person why no work 🥺
1383807362243256334	@Breaking911 Amazing: Can't name one person in my entire city, not even county that has even been hospitalized due to covid. Not much of a pandemic when every single person you do daily business with hasn't even been hospitalized.
1473087019903451139	"@laralogan FEAR, FEAR, FEAR... No mention of the fact that the vaxxed can also get, spread, have symptoms, be hospitalized, and die from Covid19 and/or any variant. During a harassment training, I learned that talk like this is called ""OTHERING""."

1385559093855850498	@flaming_rh @AndrewRTDavies I think the question is why have we had so many deaths despite the restrictions? My guess is poor decision making early on (hospital patients shunted into care homes without being tested) plus dodgy stats: covid deaths are actually all-cause mortality figures with a positive test
1421504510393032704	"@StephenBowden69 @PriceSmith8 @69ayylmao69 @beetletwit @chrislhayes Yes I see the vax is still incredibly effective at preventing death and severe illness.

1532115687996641284	@nathaliejacoby1 Got covid before we could get vaccines.  Hubby was in the hospital a week.  Mine was mild but I have long term effects.  Hearing loss, autoimmune disorders.  That was January 2021 and I’m still not over it.  Still get brain fog.  I’m now fully vaxxed.
1325788528870117378	Great news about the preliminary covid vaccine results. Sadly my body decided to catch coronavirus itself and produce its own antibodies! Test result came in positive this morning. Can't taste or smell!
1425490682433605635	At the beginning of COVID I traveled to assist exhausted hospitals. Sadly, I will not continue. I’m not leaving my children to support anti-vaxxers and sociopathic governors. My heart goes out to hospital staff in these states.

1356376846288318465	Thank you @clairecmc — the vaccine feels like a lottery. My husband is in the hospital and I can only drive limited distances. We’ve had dose 1 but dose 2 was removed from our community and we have no way to get dose 2  so what are we to do? Help! #CovidVaccine #whidbeyisland
1459185680714764335	@kaley__joseph @JHC_53 @LisaMarieBoothe Want more info? I could make a list of over 100 people who had covid. 9+ of of 10 of them said, they didn’t like it, but wasn’t scary. I know 1 person that was hospitalized &amp; 1 that it really knocked him on his butt for 2 weeks. The rest have largely said the flu was worse.
1522957766641520644	@BristOliver I wonder if the figures cover the cases who have Covid and then 1-4 months later, after testing negative several times, they have mysterious heart and breathing incidents, are rushed to hospital, scanned, and, eg, clots on lungs are identified etc.  Are they in LC figures?

1549902658097631232	Just want to tell everyone please be safe out here. COVID is still here! I caught it for a 2nd time. Believe getting the shots helped because the first time I got it. I was in hospital and didn’t think I was going to make it.

1385566918543765504	@drsajumathew Interesting. I contracted covid in December of last year. I have had both Pfizer shots. What is the likelihood of getting covid again? If I got sick again would I still test positive?

1476546906545393664	@Lizardking_67 Oh for fuck sake. Why do I live here. I don't do anything anyway and have no plans but the dictatorship rule of the province has me fed the fuck up, especially when these morons are counting pregnant ppl et AL. as hospitalized covid patients
1446472306360938500	@albertan_angry What it comes down to are the processes  ring followed in the hospital to keep covid infected alive.   From what I understand, every treatment is denied out side of ventilation with DNRs.
1483555276338778115	May have gotten covid again. My roommate’s boyfriend tested positive yesterday and i’ve been feeling a bit groggy and my sinuses are acting up. Got tested earlier, so now I gotta wait for the results to come in. Hopefully it’s not positive but we’ll see.
1393346070890131456	@Rosie @MiaFarrow Me too. We have several nurses that had gotten the vaccine, tested positive for covid. Right now it appears to be light cases but the long lasting affects are scary.
1481680323205382145	@mackette52 I don't know for sure, but I'd say the vaccinated people who landed in the hospital had other problems, like cancer, heart trouble, etc.  The vaccine isn't a magic shield, but it is a powerful weapon against Covid.
1367299794968969216	I was very fortunate that I never tested positive for Covid even when everybody around me had. Monday I got the call from my Doctor that I was cleared to get the vaccine. I was hesitant at first but decided to set the appointment for today. Perfect timing living in Texas.
1502313557668544516	@TSB I have travel insurance thru my platinum account. Can’t see any mention of covid. If I book attractions in NYC but we can’t travel as tested positive for covid leading up to travelling will these be covered if the attraction won’t refund? Thanks
1469863440286052356	@SaintEd61 Moronic has yet to kill anyone. Think about that....Nobody has died after a positive test or with presumed omicron in 30 days.The only way that's possible is by rejigging how deaths are classified.Time to withdraw your deposits I think, Covid is over and austerity is next https://t.co/vtzV1xcTEG

Cr7 is yours against viral and bacterial infectn
1478510315138650117	i haven’t (knowingly?) gotten covid in the past 2 years, and i just tested positive on the 4th day of 2022. happy new year!!!!😍
1479316468130992130	@PatsKarvelas Not necessarily - my husband consistently tested negative while quarantining in a house full of COVID positive family members with no space to isolate from each other.
1472326274165129223	@ChrisCEOHopson I believe, however, that many of the current Covid hospitalizations are incidental, ie. admitted for something else but tested positive during pre admission screening

1430195818603057154	@SWFLPatriot Thats how they get the variants. The only person i know thats in the hospital dying of covid was fully vaxed and his roomate had a sniffle. All this while kate brown says no vaxed persons in her hospitals. The lies are clear and present and the danger is real. Food for thought.🇺🇲
1352281766762065921	@Alex_Stafford please can you answer why my 73yr old mum who is due to have an operation, and is classed as a priority patient is unable to have the COVID vaccine before going in to hospital? I have searched high &amp; low for places, but with no joy. The patient care is appalling.
1487508814173814789	President Biden I got all my shots my booster shots I followed everything now I’m in the hospital for another 14 days because I just received COVID-19 I have to be in the hospital for 14 days in isolation

1345218478903492610	@KirkCameron I hope you and your followers don't get the COVID-19 virus, if you do or they get it, don't go to the ER and expect to be treated by healthcare workers, this makes you a HYPOCRITE!  There's no vaccine for being stupid!
1503115943731507203	@JeffOnTheRight Covid was a minor nuisance for me last November for 2 days. I'm telling you this from the perspective of an immunocompromised person who spends 3-4 weeks per year in the hospital with real viral and bacterial infections.
1551660337736425477	Everyone around me is getting covid and I'm supposed to go camping next week. 3 negative tests so far but with my luck I'll test positive the day before leaving 🥲
1451978261655957505	@BSNRN030 I think I’m most annoyed at the lack of risk evaluation for going to the ER.  I am fully vaccinated but that doesn’t mean I can’t get Covid or even a bad symptomatic case given the right strain and hx of asthma. Also it’s a nice day and I just don’t wanna. Like I said..venting.
1545729482568658944	7. You’re OK that the nurse I worked with in ED two days ago with his surgical mask round his chin in the small, unventilated nurses’ room but who thoughtfully pulled it over his nose while bending over the small baby has tested positive for covid today
1420553986197757952	@AndreasKullman4 Thanks. I'm safe in rural NSW but love ones in Sydney are certainly struggling. 6 members have covid19, 2 in hospital. All from one household.
1482958275519946753	@nhara1983 I live in Mexico. They have blatantly lied about cases and hospitalizations. The third world is more devastated by covid but the testing, reporting and people that actually go to the hospital are less.
1382140880950341634	@keithdennison Someone said it means you already had covid I never tested positive for it but in Feb 2020 when it was a thing I had all the symptoms with a negative flu test
1382322760035270656	In 2wks, I will be Fully Vaccinated &amp; will be 95% protected from COVID. Even if I do get it, my body has enough antibodies to fight it &amp; I won't get a severe case or be hospitalized.  Very excited to protect the people around me &amp; be able to see more people I love. 🙌🏻🖤✨
1363935058596425730	for context, my boyfriend got covid friday night and we were together until tuesday. he tested positive on thursday &amp; i tested negative thursday, saturday and sunday! vaccine potentially saved my life #pfizer #livelaughlove #swag

1575833992275845121	Thirteen days. That's how long my kid tested positive for covid. We kept her out of school as long as possible, but after 10 days, as long as there was no fever, we had to send her back in.The cdc guidelines are garbage.
1520846902295613440	@MindfulMaterial @mapleafs34 @1stHungarian I'm all over? You can't maintain a single point and you're jumping to a different topic. 😆Of course you shouldn't be allowed to fly if you have Covid. But they don't test for Covid pre-flight anymore, so anyone could be positive with Covid now. 😆 That's been my point.
1392916024345890824	@AnaCabrera @TimNaftali Even if you are fully vaccinated, you can still get covid &amp; be asymptomatic. 7 people from the NY Yankees all fully vaccinated tested positive &amp; 6 are asymptomatic. You can get it &amp; spread it. I'll be wearing my mask indoors &amp; out, especially when around people I don't know!
1431236229299834885	Call me in humane, but if you are refusing the vaccine, get covid, then go to the hospital for treatment……I say back of the fuckin line.

Never place confidence in vaccines even as you should take them. #FloridaCovid has about 10% of hospitalized who are fully vaccinated. Would you go to a club if there was 10 chances in 100 you could get COVID and be hospitalized? @cfax1070

1474438544466665478	@KatieMaree_88 hey, just so you know if you test positive for covid you can actually get the person who spat on your face arrested for attempted murder since covid can potentially kill you… i had someone cough on me and that’s what the cops told me when they came out for the report.
1462873563350847495	Ah well, a positive test for Covid and the feeling I've been hit by a train ...  This is not fun. Take care and stick to the masks the social distance and anything that reduces your risk of getting this awful illness. 😭
1471588022923714560	@Skeletor1982 Seeing NHS staff in tears because of their ever increasing workload caused by selfish unvaccinated people in hospital beds with Covid is good enough for me. It should be for you, real people not data

1413374171984314369	This new Covid variant is just doing the most. Once someone goes to the hospital, it’s a miracle for them to recover and come back. I pray this one makes it 😭🙏🏾
1381481964599906304	Anyone who went to Wrestlemania. Please get a COVID test and stay home. I’m seeing Lots of positive tests. Wear a mask.
1380867853209923587	The hospital where i work only has 8 covid cases total. 2 in ICU.What a big difference from just a few months ago when we had like 70 . Wow.
1343181580680966144	@silv24 Given that about 25% of severe covid cases are caught in hospital to begin with it's also good value for vaccine:case prevention ratio. (I know its not proven to completely prevent transmission but surely it is likely to help).
1480002762792386560	the amount of patients who have told me in the last week that they chose not to go to the emergency room for serious medical problems because they couldn't afford to catch covid is honestly heartbreaking

1560979236403437571	@TonyStowell3 @MattHancock @GA_Solicitors @GMB @garethicke @ickonic @IckonicRightNow I was working in a Care Home. We had no Covid, until a high profile, London hospital sent a Covid positive patient to us without letting us know. She infected several patients and staff, some of whom died. She had been discharged before test results had come back from the lab.
1339772921686835201	I have a wife who was forced to take vaccines because she worked in ICU. She is now retired.  If they had tried to make her take this covid vaccine, I would not guarantee anyone on what or what I wouldn’t do to protect her.  These freaking drs pushing this are vile.
1380945598233329664	My hubby got a call last night that a couple he knows is very ill with covid. The wife was taken to the hospital and put on a vent last night. He was pretty shaken upon hearing the news. I begged him to get the vaccine because these variants are no joke and I'd prefer he not die.
1412829677287141376	Guys I think I got covid. Been going to the hospital for physical therapy.
1421223022179065863	@WHO @DrMikeRyan This doesn’t make sense..ex: I read 74% of the Delta Covid cases in MA are fully vaccinated people. This vaccine supposedly lessens viral effects however some are hospitalized and some died...isn’t the vaccine supposed to stop the spread? Doesn’t seem like it’s stopping anything!
1505149334840832004	@DrKate_Miller Love it. For my specialists it saves me 1 1/2 hrs for a 10min conversation and I don’t have to wait around possibly catching Covid in the hospital/GP waiting room
1522906743193227264	Well my 4 month grace period is almost over Time to prepare for covid season!!! Will I test positive a 6th time ?? Or am I immune yet ;) Time will tell !!! https://t.co/XOXfcwQYti
1615042740336590849	@keithsklar It's not rhetorical at all. Let me tell you: consistently between 70-90% of those ending up in ICU/dying from COVID-19 are unvaccinated. I've seen one single case of a possible vaccine reaction. The jab is estimated to have saved 10-20 million lives over the past 2 years.
1472779880118972422	@JoshuaPotash Good grief. My fully vaxxed BFF tested positive for covid today after I insisted we get a rapid test from cvs. My fully vaxxed and boosted self is now isolating for the next week (at least). This messaging is definitely not compassionate, and dangerous.
1376605731391213575	It seems like every day I read a headline that says something along the lines of “new extremely dangerous strain of COVID-19 is spreading rapidly” or “Why covid is here to stay 😱” but it’s been over a year now and I’m still waiting to test positive
1414116419629895684	I would like a BBC announcement to tell the world I have tested positive for Covid as well please. There is no limit on the sympathy I will accept at this difficult time.
1395440908523294724	I mean, given how much hospitals received in funding per case I'm amazed there aren't more expose's on how people died because they weren't covid patients but got shoddy care due to not being worth anything to the hospital.
1418535646394736645	Now they r claiming antibodies from covid wane after 6 months, now how do they know this at this point? Too early, &amp; then, my sis in law has STILL not been retested for covid after fully jabbed but hospitalized  w/respiratory  /heart problems, Y not Houston??
1476008632194117634	my FULLY VACCINATED supervisor just tested positive for Covid …stop shoving that “get vaccinated” “ wear a mask” BS down peoples throats!!! You can do everything CDC recommends and guess what? BING BONGGGGG
1560076523117371393	@AnaKasparian Sorry Ana, but you are young and healthy. The vaccine meant nothing for you. 80% of people hospitalized for Covid are OBESE. The other 21% have underlying health conditions. I got Covid a year ago at 48 &amp; was unvaxed, but healthy. I was sick for 2 days then I was fine.
1381685208332832772	@elisa1121 The thing is that you and yours are vaccinated. You will be ok the others have to worry about contracting the virus. I was totally against it until I got the Covid and wound up in the ICU for a week. As long as you take care of you and yours don’t worry about the naysayers.
1471964144257712140	@SlavitchMichael @SteveMcGeorge1 @StuntmanStu So is the common cold. And the flu.  And from what I’ve read and heard, the effects of  Omicron are not much worse on those who are double vaxxed than a cold.  But we don’t limit or close restaurants for those.   3 people are in hospital today due to Covid. Zero in ICU
1413531891982954504	@peeleraja @sidin i guess struggling with covid for a while (in ICU) and then passing away is a massive double whammy. cuts down both your savings and future income. also wondering if standard insurance policies (5-10L per year) cover enough of tail risk
1384469668979744769	Idk if this is possible but I’ll pay someone 30 dollars if you can get a positive covid test with my name on it. I’m trying to use these covid vacation hours and grind The show for a week straight

1478952021780746244	@lotuswoodstock @ComeGetYourCat If 1,354 kids *per day* were hospitalized for drowning you’d abolish every swimming pool.And because your bullshit got me curious, in 2017 almost 1,000 kids drowned in the US. Last year, 700 died of covid. In a one-week period just last month, over 300,000 kids got covid. https://t.co/ef75Qy7pqG
1412808405304049673	My family tested positive for covid. Last 5 days we overcomed difficult situation. It's better now.Even we already vaccineted it was hard.Even you already vaccineted please don’t take it easy.Always wear MASK! take good care of your safety and health. Stay safe,everyone.Fighting!
1387905787746521091	Thread. Meanwhile, I know of more than one Covid death after at least partial vaccination and one rehospitalization and positive test after having been cleared as “recovered” from a prior Covid hospitalization. Things are still unclear, here.
1416425428085092355	@AnneWhi84558608 Proof? Not one child under 16 has died of covid in the u.k and I'm unaware of one being ever admitted to icu... Some have been hospitalised but for children seasonal flu is statistically more harmful... So what point are you making?
1438118094833127428	@realchasegeiser yep. She is the only Covid person I know who has been hospitalized this whole time. She has co-morbidities. I know 2 other vaxxed people who have had Covid and remained home.  I do not know anyone, unvaxxed, who has had Covid. I know they exist, but in 19 months, not in my world.
1341446707431784448	Having successfully rode out Covid once I get the vaccine will be an achievement. Having family members and people I know test positive. The best preemptive attack we’ve seen. 😌
1452443636893995010	@ClauWowPaw Posts on Reddit &amp; 4chan, I’ve never used those sites lol. You clearly haven’t seen the data from the gov website stating vaccinated people are in hospital with Covid. You did no research and took a trial vaccine but I’m the uneducated one? https://t.co/lW9MmdEpg7

1542669015092535301	I think  I’m sexy but I dunno. Not sure I guess. I just tested positive for COVID and am headed to Minions showings all weekend to try and start some shit. Are you in?
1516105984925646854	@nilikm Sad, I hope that this child recovers. With no underlying conditions &amp; available data, it is very likely they will. Pre Covid, my 3 kids were admitted to hospital @ points in their life for these same symptoms...Continued in comments
1568009678399078400	@ProfPCDoherty @CircleReader I just was diagnosed with Covid today. Now I am nervous.
1519939443984986112	@JeffChamberlin6 @mendingmenace @elizabethwhit20 @Humanlty1o1 It pushes Ivermectin and is about how Covid is actual snake venom and the vaxes are venom or anti-venom - I'm not sure, and Remdesivir makes you a hybrid with Satan. So they're trying to demonize the drug mostly used on very sick people with respiratory problems in hospital. 😠
1598110233054023680	@_xhoudini @DrSdeG I'm sorry that you have all been going through this.   Have the family members who are now sick previously been diagnosed with covid?
1412383294533083141	@QuakerJon @Luke_Bird @GaryLineker There are more vaccinated people in hospital with covid than unvaccinated. I am amazed people trust Pfizer and Pharma companies as they have all been fined for bribing and falsifying data. Pfizer received the biggest fine in history and caused the deaths of many African children

1379834242960515076	@iamasiadenise I just saw one that said he tested positive for Covid
1375306758697017346	@PaulLund74 @Zigmanfreud Not really true. Teachers indoor with kids who test positive for Covid aren't tested or aren't MANDATED to be tested. I would think you test everyone within a pretty big area.
1374430084874919936	@CMOH_Alberta I will have a Covid update right now for you. Using Yesterday's numbers0.14% of all of Alberta is infected.0.006% of all of Alberta is in hospital.You are self admitting the healthcare system under your control is overwhelmed by these numbers.
1380434248079970305	@AsdaUkSupport  just had my delivery I am self isolation your website says your driver will put in bags.  My driver did not put anything in bags told me self isolation is over my husband was just taken into hospital for covid.  I i want an apology from your fucken driver
1437066015121289222	@CazzaFPL Captain and loyalty. Bielsa trusts a small group of players, but he trusts them a lot. Not aware of any Struijk fitness issues, but Klich was out with a positive covid test recently. Rodrigo specifically, I think Bielsa really wants to work and maybe judges it differently to us.
1386677213051777024	Your whole plan will be ruined one student has tested positive and what kind of demand teacher are expressing that go and take your covid test I have a simple question for them will they send their child to the hospital for test?#cancel12thboardexams2021 @PMOIndia @DrRPNishank
1477508077855277057	Everyone in my family (all living in the same house) has tested positive by both RAT and then PCR test to covid - except me.Everyone is sick with flu like symptoms  - except me. Everyone is fully vaxed - except me. 🤔
1471966074191101954	Literally can’t take anyone seriously who doesn’t take covid seriously. Currently in the hospital and I’m vaccinated. This is no joke.
1420212427703169027	It’s chillin tho I think I might have Covid I’m honestly exhausted from a lot of things so hopefully I test positive
1394188676372975616	Idk, don't say you tested positive for COVID when you clearly didn't.  One thing I hate is making me worry and overthink. Tolerated this for a few days, but no, I'm not that girl anymore. 😩😩😩
1480731792202244096	@last1stbornx @whereispankaj @Timcast I had covid.. and I didn't die or get hospitalized. Omicron isn't scary.

1383071855272157184	@artist4ever @suzibitch1 And I know a woman who knew she'd been exposed to COVID and rather than quarantining, went to her appointment. She's now tested positive.  So she's in the Stupid People Factor too.
1482535534220169220	@Millions 81 coins . My cash app is dgoodale65. Nice win would be good since I tested positive for covid. I wouldn't wish this on my enemy
1358158634874789892	To my understanding all care home residents in Scotland have received at least their first dose of the vaccine. So why doesn’t this read, “10 residents have died after being vaccinated at Scottish care home, whilst 43 staff tested positive for coronavirus”?

1452782511176577025	@dankojones We have 2 who claim to have it, but probably haven’t been tested and won’t be unless they end up in the hospital. I hate to think of when they get better what they will say about Covid 🙁
1375125956122267655	@VailResorts I didn't use my pass at all this year because of family members in high risk group.  If I caught covid, there is a high risk they would have ended up in the hospital or worse.  You need to offer a roll over credit to customers that couldn't take the risk of being infected
1436023868204851232	@NyQuilDayQuil What if I only think I have a cold, got a negative flu and covid test but haven’t had the common cold diagnosed by a doctor so it could still be something else as far as I know. Should I use your product for those symptoms?
1614614562862415872	I am not anti vax. But when the #COVID19 vax came out, no doctor or researcher on the planet could say what potential side effects there would be and the death count was artificially inflated by counting any death with a positive test as a covid death #unvaccinated
1430213409719586822	@MayorKnoxWhite Never mind, I found the answer. A Covid Hospitalization is anyone that has tested positive for Covid OR Influenza. Based on this data, they may be in the hospital for something else. https://t.co/dXflKFZUPM
1472956291257704456	@Emywinst Yes he's good. I only problem I have is.This weekend I'm tested positive for COVID-19.  I have No Symptoms, No Doctors told me how to take care of it besides to  Quarantine for 10 days. It's there  Antibiotics, or another  Medication? I'm fully vaccine but they not telling us

1478401928069582857	#POstables I know many of you are waiting to hear my COVID results and the test was positive. Because I’m fully vaccinated and have been quarantined for a week, by CDC standards I am “free to move about the plane.” Feeling fine too 😊
1478198992697794560	@DreaCupcake_ 😭😭😭😭wow really? This pandemic is real, and people are taking it lightly. I had Covid in August and was in the hospital for over a week. It's no joke or picnic. I hope you don't catch it Dreamcake .
1447559461741076484	@HerdenMichelle @beefix @RealCandaceO Actually no… I wear a mask so I don’t breath on strangers. And yes, I may still get Covid. Just like I might get a cold. Vaccination means not going to the hospital. Not dying. It is with us for the long haul. Reducing its ability to kill people is worth it.
1596100313122947072	@VesperAegis @tee9540 @WalkerBragman I have never had a positive Covid test but I abruptly stopped forming new autobiographical memories the way I used to in the spring. I’m a completely different person.
1479167771988488193	@jadamsonpickett That sounds so miserable! Really sorry you’re dealing with this. Anecdotally, I’ve seen lots of folks on social media say they had symptoms for several days before their COVID test came back positive. Might be safest to assume you have it. But either way, what a drag.
1446237305354788867	I find it supremely ironic that anti-vaxers refuse and scoff at the science that developed the COVID vaccine, but when they're in the hospital at death's door on a ventilator, they embrace the science with open arms.
1471002017061556226	@JamilFarouk @ZulianJoubert I have 6 direct family members who got Covid, 5 in this wave. None vaccinated. Not one severely ill, not one in hospital. Your faith is strong.

1379440073851219968	@t_yarmas @AlexBerenson I’m pretty sure you are wrong. That chart would claim then during all of winter there were never more than 60 people in the hospital with covid at 1 time. Impossible.
1480158936561074178	@JRD0000 He said he had covid positive pcr test when he was at events maskless. So he's either lying about covid or he's a (well I'm sure you know the sort of word for it) people with covid shouldn't be out in public

1430919018765066240	798 children admitted to hospital with Covid this month alone and the government are claiming schools are safe for cev/cv and all other children? So they are taking cev kids off the shielding list now. No many with a data sheet and a clip board is talking me around.

1387437748299128834	@blackgirlinmain I just recovered from Covid and if I didn’t take care of my body prior to contracting it along with having my first vaccine dose, I think I would be in hospital
1442823983372636162	@LionelThring @ChristianWalk1r and the sheep says........ The vaccine does somewhat help with the severity of symptoms, however, you can still end up in the hospital and die from covid even if you are fully vaccinated. Show me where they say masks work....I'll wait... They don't work...

1568762340572647424	@md_wallach @AnilMakam Tom, if Dr Makam says severe Covid is over, based on n=20, it’s over! Dr Makam also told me the death data are “fake”Some patients test + for SARS-Cov-2 incidentally when hospitalized for some other cause; that’s not what Dr Makam was talking about—he said death data are fake!

1376562460325515264	@DarkFilly because everyone loves infographsI've never got confirmation of something I heard on the radio news that COVID causes a positive Flu Test and vice-versa.

So I'm sorry but sounds like you don't do research on your own, because you would find there is no data saying variants effect previous exposure.

But we're all required to get a vaccine before we can get back to normal life, even tho we can still spread it? Even though we won't get ours till late August ffs.

1480970957904748545	@ReadMoreBible I haven’t had COVID for 18 months since vaxed in Pfizer trial, nor have any of my 28+ family members who’ve been vaxed. If any of us get infected we’ll be protected from severe illness leading to hospitalization or death! Vast majority of Covid patients in ICU are still unvaxed.

1458118428695449603	@thisisallicoul1 @LifeIsAmorFati @DrLeanaWen Yeah so you can still contract and transmit covid while jabbed. The jab efficacy is shit after 6 months. You can also still end up in the hospital. I applaud ike your effort at regurgitating the talking points tho.A for effort!

1424729283730288641	@iconovoxx I couldn't handle the guilt if I chose not to get vaccinated and gave covid to my kids or grandkids, but then it seems some people would have a clear conscience with the risk/possibly. They would be 100% responsible if their children need up in hospital. Not worth the risk.
1454172623093460993	@snpsandsnRNPs @Guru85Neurotic @Capd_Crusadr376 @Borys_Kit @kimmasters Those Numbers are inflated the cdc had hospitals count everyone that tested positive within 30 days be counted as a covid death, regardless of case of death. So the truth is you and I have no idea how much covid has truly killed
1446839238729867266	"My guy @ASherrodblakely dropping some knowledge on the COVID-19 vaccine ""personal choice"" that many NBA players are talking about it right now. It's only a personal issue until you test positive. Then it's most definitely not 🏀 https://t.co/kFzoyM6HFu"
1477789135435931650	Thanks for the Birthday wishes, my birthday was good until I found out my Big bro’s wife got tested positive but don’t know if my Big bro has it, Covid ruined my birthday dinner tonight.
1345759551094665216	@karendumas @FOX2News @charlielangton I thought your comments this morning about the vaccine were appalling. You can note the three people who tested positive after becoming vaccinated, but WHEN did they get covid? Was it before getting the jab? It takes over 2 weeks to build up enough immunity to prevent illness.
1382190869738967045	"2nd one is because i said that a doctor said ""boo we hate your pussy"" abt a person i dont like bc their gcs got delayed due to the hospital being full of covid patients and they were complaining on twitter abt it while p were dying lmao"
1355594027484082176	Misleading headline. He tested positive. We already know that's possible side-effect of vaccine.This could be a career-ender for folks who have to test negative to keep jobs.What I want to know is what happens when someone gets vax, then really gets covid-19.
1465314979213578255	@ringsau They have to start issuing vaccine card equivalents to those who test covid positive. Im vaxxed. But it is preposterous that a vaccine mandate is being forced on the covid-recovered.
1465545261812387844	@tbailey1976 I guess we are not told. I just got text, phone call, whrn I had tested positive for covid. That was back in Oct.Never knew what type.

1436592495253757952	@johnredwood As far as I know, there was no NHS Early Treatment for Covid 19 in the United Kingdom. People were just told to stay at home (without treatment) till they became so ill that they had to be taken to hospital. Many people died because of this policy.

1428207277832605701	@_lewisy @dvir_a agree. the data should be presented as incidences: 0.06% of 16-19 year old males diagnosed with COVID-19 end up seriously ill, while 0.016% of 16-19YO males develop myocarditis due to Pfizer vaccine. @yuvharpaz [as I said earlier: MoH has better AE detection capability than CDC]
1356381042681274368	@mikedav14049206 @mermaid_daisy He’s doing great.  I’m trying to find out when he can get the Covid vaccine. I think you have to wait if you’ve tested positive.
1388704225446793216	@PersianCatLadyJ @CapitalismEvil @drmwarner I'm a nurse. Had my first Pfizer shot Feb 24. Second shot that was scheduled for Mar 31 was bumped to June. I became ill and tested positive for Covid on April 28th - 9 weeks out.
1480704015553941509	@NickFondacaro Make no mistake, children being hospitalized FOR Covid is something we need to be aware of -- but if asymptomatic cases are being picked up via testing when a child *is admitted for a NON-RELATED issue*, it's inflating the numbers.And I got grief for pointing that out recently.
1433974945508380678	@JCCFCanada I don't like it, however.....your chances of getting COVID while in hospital are not insignificant. That would be terrible for a transplant patient.
1476342800513789953	@rob_bristow_CA @QMccashin @JT91saucey @rayferrarotsn Yea I have, I know a handful of people that work in the ICU. Literally say they haven't seen a healthy unvaccinated person die of covid yet, in fact they have seen more people die by the treatment for covid. And the numbers aren't accurate because people are in the covid ICU
1427413609483735042	I was diagnosed with Covid yesterday and I feel terrible 💔😢
1478115653592793088	This. This is why I am terrified of testing positive - it's not about the temporary inconvenience of acute repiratory illness, but rather the unknown lifelong effects of long covid - something 1 in 3 people who test positive end up dealing with!
1516580149508116483	@singer_joseph @aoglasser Exactly.  78% of all hospitalized with COVID were obese. The overwhelming majority by choice.  People with treatable cancer died because of peoples lifestyle choices. But I guess that’s their “freedom”
1461291074773782529	This is what happened to me! I got exposed to Covid, had a negative antigen, isolated straight away after getting symptoms and then got two negative antigens while waiting for my PCR test which was positive! I didn't test positive on antigen for 5 days after displaying symptoms

1384704010297384965	Maldonado on Altuve: “So far he feels good, so that’s a good sign.”I’m assuming Jose tested positive but is asymptomatic. The teams’ secrecy around Covid is really annoying.
1484288009352720386	just had a fun lil covid scare (my roommate tested positive) i just took a rapid test and was negative. Currently quarantining in my room 😳 it’s only the 3rd day of my semester
1395504065031942149	@POTUS Remember when the coronavirus was hitting hard and all those white people were out there spitting on people and several racist white groups with threatening to spit on others if they tested positive foolish of me but I thought that's what the coronavirus bill was about
1436306634343657484	@hahaokfine sorry, I dont agree. Nobody has the right to perpetuate Covid, spread it to the elderly or children that cant be vax. And when non vax get Covid, they end up hospitalized, intubated, or dead. that's on all of us.
1416889968321044481	Keep pulling yall did a awesome job yall pulled me right to where im supposed to be at and that's in the hospital for covid 19 i just wanted to say i love y'all for that

1355293621982027781	@RealMattCouch I love driving trips anyway. I had the Covid a year ago this week. I will not be taking the vaccine since I tested positive for the antibodies. Furthermore aren’t the airlines hemorrhaging enough cash already.

1478394286425223173	@kathy_leibowitz @News12NJ It's scary to think that you assume everyone who gets COVID and chose not to get the shots ends up in the hospital.Nobody I know is, including the many that chose not to get vaxxed. It passed in 2-3 days.

1422218421408776198	I spoke to Ruby about my experiences in hospital with Covid. Please get tested regularly, even if you don’t have symptoms, and most importantly if you do have it, isolate properly. A lot of preventable losses and the government are looking to blame young people.
1425007109926707209	@wfaa Don't travel internationally!!! Everyone I know with Covid has been fully vaccinated and they are SICK. These were otherwise HEALTHY people who would have just had mild or no symptoms pre vaccine. And yes. Some had to go to hospital for the Pneumonia
1510293313294946311	@AMannanBaig @angryhacademic Sorry for “butting in” -Thank you , we need help. I need to get back to the pre vax me, my life like many  others have been totally turned upside down. I’ve been diagnosed with unexplained neurological symptoms in the aftermath of a covid vaccination- it’s in my clinical notes
1518993065008107523	I don’t care who you are—unless you work on my personal staff—if you test positive for COVID, get some rest. No symptoms can easily turn to symptoms.
1478826578134155268	@RecordingAcad So basically what everyone should do is just go into their homes lay down and just wait to die... this is absurd. And I was in icu with covid 10 days. Don't live in fear...
1511021586496860166	@katieharris140 I'm finding it really tough too. Tested positive less than two weeks ago and at least at peak covid I got all of the sleep. I can hardly take care of myself. Wish I worked from home but as a teacher I can't work like this.
1426026278855995393	@MosmanResources @peterc_150 I suspect they want to utilise all the AZ before they expire, so let’s ‘live with Covid’ and drive the numbers up, as more people in icu and death increases, people will get the jab? I might be totally off. Can’t help but think it’s a calculated move by LNP.
1425648107518320641	@EliseiNicole This is why I’m against free college tuition. No amount of schooling will help these lost causes in Tennessee. 97% of unvaccinated are hospitalized and over 99% of unvaccinated die of Covid. Just let them continue to not wear masks and let Darwin do it’s job. 🤷‍♀️

1514366034031128585	So the two people i live with have both tested positive for Covid. I've done 2 tests so far and come up negative luckily, but considering the close proximity in which we live, i've probably got it and its just not enough of a viral load to register yet bleh
1431065476394852352	Prayers for my hubs please. He went to er yesterday and they said if he wouldn't have come he would have died. Covid has decimated his lungs/heart. Drs never saw such damage from a healthy person before. He is getting many tests to determine a course of action.
1401922167374184454	@s22bos21 @peterbakernyt @axios @Ipsos @DavidNather Good point. I missed the blaming but you are  on point. Still at this point I’m blaming those who die from this (post-vaccine) because they chose not to get vaccine. One died yesterday and one in the hospital now. Not afraid of covid but afraid of the vaccine?
1425631664336633861	I have about 8 patients admitted to the hospital within the last week alone! &amp;only two of them were vaccinated…those two had mild symptoms and went in due to other reason not pertaining to covid…six of them are in the ICU with oxygen, pneumonia and one on a ventilator…

1617254241369735170	@banthebbc @ScottAdamsSays I don’t believe people were duped, they’re just stupid. For example, they literally TOLD YOU that “Covid deaths” were “deaths from any cause within 28 days of a positive test” for example, yet there are people who, to this day, will cite that figure as the number of deaths. Mad.
1476165589139955716	Pinged this morning saying I'd been in close contact with someone on 27th Dec who's tested positive for covid. I've not seen anyone since 23rd Dec! #bemused
1475952843433598979	Hubs &amp; I had “original” Covid 1/21. He’s had a small cough and fatigue the past few days, so today he home tested positive. I think it’s just a cold &amp; anyone with a cold will test positive, since that’s what Covid actually is.
1480976977263800323	@WUTangKids I ate hummus - delicious hummus - more than once when I was hospitalized for Covid in 2020. And I got better. So I’m going to suggest hummus is a cure for Covid? I’m so tired of these morons.

1479558854576848899	The numbers people quote in many places as people hospitalized because of covid are people hospitalized with covid.  The difference is important, and I cannot believe the supreme court arguments didn't clarify this today.

1378374635323031555	@AmigoNews20 @photomikeyhere The government are fine to push the 'died within 28 days of a positive test' narrative and record the deaths on the covid death stats so moving the goalposts to deny that they are vaccine related deaths doesn't work for me
1599875678568316928	Don't know about you, but I am still struggling with the assumption 'We got through Covid'. There are around 5000 people (over 400 in hospital) right now who might not agree with that. As for LC, it's a myth, right?

1384161013696655368	@MayorHancock Everyone I know that has had the vaccine has had a worse reaction then every person I know that actually had covid. I know more people that went to the hospital after vaccine than covid. So go screw
1488231770810163200	Honestly probably the most nervous half of my life there. Felt a bit shit today and took a Covid test, was fully expecting it to be positive and I’d miss Easter Road 😅
1472606011013967882	@JohnHillbery I don’t have the answers and neither do you. Respect his decision &amp; I wouldn’t wish Covid on anybody.I tested positive lost taste for a week before any symptoms, they lasted a week, then no taste for another week. Dr said cuz I’m not high risk
1543305126122852353	@DrJenGunter My husband was double boosted and got COVID. He is still testing positive 10 days later but his symptoms are better. We can't figure out where he got it because he was only around a few people prior and none of them had it. I tested negative.
1518568393766588420	hey y’all, I tested positive for COVID. i’m getting a PCR test today, but for people’s info, here were my locations for the last few Louis shows:- Manc1&amp;2: back of pit, middle- London: back of pit, left-middle- Donny: back of pit, left
1384325486986285063	@MelDMann @PergamIC I saw multiple people in hospital with covid last week including several in ICU on life support. You are not over reacting by doing simple things to be cautious.
1447629854422278144	"@kmcurk The radiology tech in the ER I went to asked me if I had Covid. I said no, and that I had been vaccinated. He proceeded to tell me that he hadn't and wasn't planning to because so far he's been fine and he wasn't worried since he's ""a lot younger than me."""

1426651014501998596	@gamitech @Mike45223 @SunsetZen1 @NAChristakis I had Covid last December was significantly exposed 2 weeks ago to someone who was Covid positive over a several day period.  I didn’t not get Covid again.  Went has far as to test several times the next week and never tested positive.
1389448028004798464	@Shehzad_Ind I understand its best to be negative in these covid times ..but its only for the PCR test .. Be positive man !!!!
1549154500799340547	just tested positive for COVID and i actually feel like i’ve been hit by a bus
1447614591408787463	Tested positive for #COVID19 after getting the vaccine even though coming in contact very many times before without the vaccine i get it less than 2 weeks after being vaccinated. It is not safe or effective. #FJB
1474398415438192677	My nephew just tested positive for covid. Someone tell me again why I shouldn't be pissed off at all the selfish shit stains who wouldn't wear a fucking mask.
1572959550709403648	@drsimonegold Ivermectin is horse medicine and will not treat COVID....My entire household was about a day from being in the hospital, a great doctor treated us with Ivermectin and we completely bounced back in 48 hours.

1522202191154532355	@MusketAnna It's been no harder than colds I've had in the past, so I assumed it wasn't Covid, but work asked me to do a test and it came up positive.
1427598156947202049	@redmorrigan @GovAndyBeshear Approx 1 million kids under 18 in KY. Total deaths to kids since day one of Covid is 2 yes that is what you are reading 2 deaths total. Under 18 in hospital for Covid 3 not 300 it's a total of 3. Talk to me a out kids at risk agaim and at risk of what ?
1427373254117892109	@The_Old_Rascal @mckennaware1 He know these people are lying…everybody lying…I went to the hospital with lax requirements on Covid sanitation requirements…not nan one of us got sick. Not one and I was in dat bish for a week…this whole thing is a farce
1418989439033004033	In case anyone forgot, this is my county. We quit school testing in January. HUNDREDS of kids were testing positive weekly for months, and we quit releasing daily Covid data. No test, no case. I kept receipts, &amp; someday I will come for our leaders, if I survive.
1450089212083150849	@Otto_English I’m so angry with Them breaking rules so oftenI was homeschooling, not seeing anyone inc my support net for my MH. Trying to make WFH work like a lot of othersI ended up in hospital 7 weeks MH relapse. If people followed the rules less would be dead. Covid AND excess deaths
1377347473224605697	It’s absolute bullshit that I can’t get the vaccine before certain people (who act like covid is fake) and the fact that just because my asthma hasn’t put me in the hospital within the past 6 months I’m probably going to be one of the last people to get it that’s disgusting
1466019768465596421	@2FloridaMermaid @AlexandreRosaC8 @KirseyBelle @AmyA1A My point is that we shouldn’t be wasting our time arguing over masks. It’s stupid and driven by media, but if a business requires it, then respect the rule or don’t enter. I trust the data on my vax which says I likely won’t go to the hospital if I get covid. No booster yet…
1472606587470626827	@jennsinger @JayDabhi @MeghanMcCain I find it odd that they aren't reporting what other causes are sending people to hospitals at this time of the year. All kinds of things are sending people to the hospital not just covid. They are understaffed because of the insane vaccine mandates.
1383013565918031878	My pcr covid test came back negative! Hubby was infected 4/8, diagnosed 4/13. I slept next to him, kissed and snuggled him from 4/8 to 4/13. But I still have to go to work and see patients but yet quarantine at home when not at work. How is that safe for others?!?
1326279871186825223	@MISSIRISDENISE1 @aigkenham @unashamedojesus Nowhere that I have seen does it say that the vaccine CURES COVID-19. It only says that the vaccine PREVENTS it. So only take it if you have tested negative. If you tested positive, you are stuck with the virus.
1379967664135622657	@ameetkhabra @carillonjane I guess we need to wait &amp; see if it is a bad case of COVID - because technically the vaccine is supposed to keep you from getting so sick you have to be hospitalized but it is not 100% protection...? Or we are 90% protected and that person was the 10%? Oh, this is such bad news!
1474366166642606101	@IreneDethlefse7 @BMeiselas Why? Vaccinated people can spread the virus, too. Triple vaccinated people are getting infected. Not my fault you were sold a defective product. I've never been infected. I'm not going to the hospital. 80% of covid hospitalizations are overweight and obese. Quit blaming me.
1432824716729806848	@anniefitness We didn’t have COVID in 2019 for a start , in my 20 years in icu I’ve never had someone die from the flu
1419134305528287234	@itbothersthefk1 @FairDinkumCap @abcnews I don't understand the question.COVID is many times worse than the flu.Flu doesn't put otherwise healthy people in hospital or kill them.Flu doesn't cripple the health system in advanced economies.
1430247898198028293	@jrbj2310 @CoachDerekMason I'm not all into getting into a political bullshit argument. I'm not. My wife is in the medical field and works at Emory in Atlanta. They have yet to have a fully vaccinated patient die from COVID. They haven't even had a single person have to go to the ICU...
1479942694684303361	@abbylabar_ @CanesOnBally Well no COVID concern for Freddie, as he’s already through that fiasco. My thoughts are Raanta tested positive thus cannot go?
1423331294067441670	I would like to just reiterate this concept the goal isn’t to end covid , it’s to have zero ppl gger deathly ill and go to the hospital from covid …it’s really not a hard concept
1552694140105801734	Got my second booster shot today. My arm hurts and I feel a little tired but otherwise I am perfectly fine and glad to get the extra protection for working in the hospital and interacting with a lot of people. Please stay safe everybody. #CovidIsNotOver
1486396729779965961	Doing a home test for COVID tonight &amp; was told to go back to the testing garage on Friday. fkn swear I will beat a bitch up if it’s positive this time around. Jk
1445933024026132486	@TheNicholasSams You think?? No local doctor would touch me when I had Covid…was told to go to the hospital if breathing got difficult. Front Line Doctors me a hydroxychloriquine prescription…Recovered nicely now.
1374082201621512192	@ScottFishman I do not know anyone who has died from covid, and only know 2 that have tested positive.
1477190868704501766	Five nurses in my wife's unit tested positive for Covid. Get your fucking shots and wear a fucking mask.Happy new year.
1456618514421358601	@tandog421 @CharlesSneed17 @sj_ca1867 @TSN_Edge @TomPelissero @TSN_Sports I'm sure data in the US is similar, but almost 40% of hospitlizations are under 50, so while people may not die of COVID, ending up in hospital is not fun. The United States is also less vaccinated than Canada, so those sick &lt;50 people are perpetuating spread in the community. https://t.co/INbwUj6XZ4
1407671581174865924	@SenWarren Vaccine hesitancy is occurring because @CDCgov @CDCDirector are silencing vaccine reactions! #transparencyIsKey I had #covid19 last Nov &amp; got my 2nd @pfizer shot in April. I was hospitalized the next day. Stop being pompous &amp; ACKNOWLEDGE it Here’s my story https://t.co/eepLP0QYZg
1583377780678733824	@antonious320 Our union gave us 2 options.quarantine without being tested, or be able to leave a city centre hotel but with a covid test which if positive requires a week at Penny's bay... I think the 2nd option was still hypothetical though.Anyway, the majority went for quarantine.
1477431048359358468	@linnetmoss @beinlibertarian Being unvaxxed, healthy and having already recovered from Covid I’ve even less likely to end up in the hospital 😎
1593039427831746560	@ytunderground23 @teflontelfer @Mayhem15118416 Personally, I'm still masking in public. We had 2 newborns in my family end up in ICU for RSV. No tylenol or advil for kids in the stores. It's not just covid lately.
1486332240284028936	@joncoopertweets I don’t think the unvaxed should be allowed to go to the hospital if they get Covid, so no, I have no sympathy
1393328375041708032	I’m back, and the word of the day is transparency. Folks, it seems the COVID infection I fought off over a year ago ended up wreaking havoc in my central nervous system. I’ve been diagnosed with post-COVID fibromyalgia—a condition characterized by chronic, incurable pain. https://t.co/QHEhDzrYqQ
1386696784123203586	@PalmerReport @Rosie5278 Exactly!! I was in bed with a fever, aches, chills for a few days after Moderna #2. BUT... I knew I would improve &amp; not end up hospitalized (or worse), I didn’t have to be quarantined, &amp; I knew it meant I was more protected from COVID than prior to the shot. Soooooo worth it!
1550939479648526336	Mine is also tapering off after 3 days but I'm still going in for my PCR test cos my Doctor wants to monitor for Long COVID, if positive. My RATs continue to be negative... 🤷🏽 If PCR was still de rigeur in Canada, this wouldn't have dragged out so long.
1519004779699228672	@ElectionWiz i dont believe them at all , they are full of shit none of them have or got COVID every 2/3 weeks they pick another name out of a hat and say they have or tested positive to keep Covid a headline i dont believe none of it they are phony you can see right through it

1480614316181053441	I don’t think Covid is fake.! Having said that a healthy person who contracts this has a better than 95% chance of surviving it.  Now if you are85 and are over weight have high blood pressure and diabetes or any other disease The maybe not so much.  If you go into hospital ? https://t.co/dwMnGuc5as

1465288568876802053	@JagerLizard @Da_Fixxer @NewshubNZ plus I don't think having positive tested people staying in MIQ is the solution. we all manage to stay home with other illnesses and when things turns bad you seek help (call doctor or go to a hospital), why should covid be any different

1481449763249668097	1 of every 77 Whatcom residents tested positive for Covid in the first 10 days of 2022, per the @BhamHerald. That is an absolutely MIND BLOWING number. And I've been following omicron so I knew it was going to be crazy but that case rate blew my mind.
1385440931692748801	@zang0 @paulg Please learn fundamentals of statistics, metrics like test positivity rate and how death rate is calculated in India (its based on covid positive patients so less testing doesnt impact this metric).

1478368134746849280	@DuaneSnow12 @BrandonJMay @RealBrysonGray Show me where hospitals are ‘overrun’. Hospitals are always busy. That’s how they make money. I’ve never seen an almost empty hospital. You? If you go to the hospital because of a heart attack and happen to have Covid- you’re not there BECAUSE of Covid.

1378739380605571080	@hanna_mrs @drmwarner @ONgov No, I showed up because a doctor said if we spent $114 to give the one women a day off, she wouldn't have been in the ICU with COVID. I pointed out we don't have a crystal ball and the $114 would need to actually be $1,900,000,000 since we can't possibly predict who has COVID.

1523016104909500416	Got a notification that the hybrid event I attended virtually this week had an attendee to the in-person portion that has tested positive for COVID. So unsurprised and I'm feeling a lot less FOMO about not going.

1561017219898920963	@Kit_Yates_Maths @danielgoyal My partner &amp; I have tested positive. We can afford the £9.80 for 5 tests. We are fit &amp; healthy generally but it’s really wiped us out.

1597665571575070720	@Heathsmiff @Magnolia_613 @Burns95085638 @ColleenAckert Many illnesses spread as a result of &amp; following war &amp; migration. This includes but is not limited to ‘Spanish’ flu..,which yes was overly and mid diagnosed, much like COVID. Your assumption also proves the saying associated. Sandman IS in my recommended for you, unwatched
1436205176994545665	@SmomKev Exactly and mine are just Psych meds and with my mental health their playing such a dangerous game yet I see addicts walk in and fill scripts like tic tacs like wtf I’m suffering trying not to go to the hospital cuz of covid people
1428354898832216076	@wardmj4 @EricTopol I’ll agree that cases are higher at 100k per day but deaths are down to 700 per day (in the US) That’s a lower CFR. I think the definition of a covid death needs to be addressed, especially post vaccine. A positive test without symptoms isn’t a covid “case.” https://t.co/bjVd6k7He2
1321819519745171457	I neva had a vaccine, I neva took that COVID test, I don’t go to the hospital or doctor no mo, and I’m pretty sure I’m still healthy and breathing right😐

1438115944572723203	@Mike_Burke_UK I’m okay-ish. I just can’t agree that the situation is improving here in Japan. It’s okay if you don’t test positive for COVID and don’t have any other need to go to a hospital.So basically don’t have the virus, cancer or even cerebral palsy like I do.
1461456678109556740	@JukeboxPaula Oh no! Hope all will be ok! I got vaccinated in March. Got Covid 1st wk of October....I was sick for over a week but didn't wind up in the hospital. I also got the monoclonal antibody treatment. Ached, exhausted,headache, slight cough/cong, but mostly exhausted!!!
1373435520534073345	One year ago I was diagnosed with Covid : rough 30 days.  Thankful for  docs and nurses that got me through. And for my wonderful FAMILY and Church. #HCBCaustin What a difference a year makes. Let’s end this virus #COVID19  #GetVaccinated https://t.co/YlE96gM0iL
1474797945174343685	Shoutout to nurse Yvonne kicking out the dude who tested positive for covid19 (!) 5 days ago (!!) had a sore throat and a headache (!!!) and was insisting on getting a new test to get back to work on tuesday. I see you, nurse Yvonne.
1484011739419230212	I tested positive for covid and i'm getting bored into day 1 of being locked in How fun
1514088805141139457	@SueSueCurious My oncologist a few weeks ago wore his surgical mask underneath his chin! But told me covid is NOT the flu, as many think, so I should still avoid it. I'm not in treatment now, just check in every 3 mo. No clue what I'll do if I have to go back to treatment or be hospitalized.
1469039592489857026	@russianbotMB @afneil @bradlow69isback I am banging on about the fact that while in Hospital on the day of the illegal party you or I could not visit and say goodbye to loved ones. Regardless of the cause of death the restriction was due to Covid.
1426035758733795334	A very short list of things I have a hard time believing recently:1. A Sydney man who travelled to Byron Bay who “didn’t believe in Covid” when his wife was in hospital being treated for it, then later got tested for it after he developed symptoms
1620153404256587776	@EliseStefanik @Duncan4Congress and yet you support anti choice mandates for women who seek to end a pregnancy.  What about patients?  I was in the hospital in 2021 and asked that a nurse who  told me she was unvaccinated not be allowed in my room.  Nursing shortages existed long before covid.
1382153572213751808	@drandrewb What exactly they are testing for, on healthy people? For flu, cold, corona viruses? I guess even a stone from the moon will test positive with that crap. You are doing a big disservice to you profession by spreading this non sense.  Stop this charade. Is enough now...
1377600463063937024	@Nav_Dhadwal @SkyNews No, the UK counts them in line with the WHO guidelines. Other countries don't follow them.The one area of our reporting I don't agree with though is that if you had a positive test, recover, then within the 28 days get hit &amp; killed by a bus, you are counted as a covid death. 😡
1440965618258173955	@MichaelaNewell_ @MFWitches Yeah, right....now one of them is in hospital with covid, so that may be a forlorn hope....but I get the sarcasm
1470823688475869187	@omikhatib @boogsuge @ThomasDrance We just played Carolina and they have a few players that tested positive for covid. I'm sure everyone got told to mask up from management
1468072889786290185	You know your life is shit when you wake up at 4am to do a covid test because somebody you play poker with who you sat next to on Friday tested positive. Oh I’m also getting McDonald’s but that’s not part of the test
1375261493382483973	@sourstufff @mooninfirst I read it. Also read into the statistics. Zero hospitalizations or deaths from covid for the vaccinated that had a positive test. The vaccine is a cure. We have to stop being afraid of the cure.
1478795227267694592	@timkaine i just tested positive for covid last night at ER so scary for me with fighting cancer at same time please help i uploaded my test results on my gofundme page under updates section - https://t.co/BW8OIAAYld
1479188501404995591	Was supposed to go out to eat with my boy until his covid test came back positive, and he said we could just have dinner together over FaceTime tonight 🤧🤧❤️
1401762426203381763	@LauraMiers Not really the tip of the iceberg. In the UK Covid deaths are any deaths within 28 days of a positive test, irrespective of actual cause. I would wager that there are far more other-cause deaths misattributed to Covid than Covid deaths misattributed to other causes.
1459538206068719624	@SeamanCraig @ibleedsilvrnblu @KevinDArnold @SamIAm2021MD @TheScottCharles OK, but why is a casual eyeball diagnosis or a positive PCR test enough to say someone died FROM COVID despite numerous comorbidities? I'm just guessing, but maybe it's because they get financially rewarded for doing so? How much do hospitals get paid for filing a VAERS report?
1420127880596557828	@JohnFer55158671 @nytimes You’re missing my point. I’m not just lucky. All of the hundreds of ppl who I know have also not gotten sick or have they been hospitalized for covid. I’m not an anomaly, this is just being blown out of proportion by the media. Healthy ppl will be ok.
1481591778365304832	@ZubyMusic Zuby, welcome to Australia where up is down, right is wrong and vaccinated covid patients in ICU means the vaccine is ‘working’. As an Australian I don’t know whether to laugh or cry but I want off this island.
1377107711968473090	@operickson @zeynepyenisey Cool so you're fine with signing the declaration that says if you develop covid you will not under any circumstances go to hospital and will die proudly at home. And I mean it when I say proudly, no crying as you drown in your own mucus cold and alone in your own bed.
1472218369432633348	"@mehdirhasan I guess she hasn't seen the countless stories - ""Vocal anti-vaxer contracts covid, dies in hospital"".  I fear this will be in their future."
1479133924727132164	I dont know how but i feel fine other then the sniffles but i tested positive for #Covid so now im locked in my room while my fam has to stay away from me….fucking hell like wtf!?!??!
1382547240800047113	@LegendaryEnergy I saw a meme of a uncovered little trash bin at a nurses station in the ER with it overfilled with used masks. If covid was so bad and if its true it sticks to surfaces why wouldn't they throw them away in a biohazard waste?
1514337782650617858	@drmikehart My doctor told me off the record three things you do not do you do not take a Covid test under no circumstances put the poisonous vaccine in your body and if you feel sick do not go to hospital call your doctor immediately and I will give you the medicine to make you better
1384137699427188742	I am praying for the speedy recovery of Dr.Manmohan Singh who has been tested Covid Positive.
1447638270016462849	@NC_Governor This is such a lie. I’ve had 2 kids at home sick with Covid the last 2 weeks and they wore their mask every day. Not to mention people I personally know always wore their mask either passed or in the hospital on a vent. You and all the rest in congress are nothing but big liars!
1487829490235543559	Thank you to @CheeseburgerROH for his patience on this.

1387159101394857986	Why are people still delusional about this virus? I know someone who still thinks Covid is a hoax, got covid, with a positive test STILL denied she had it, and is now saying it’s us vaccinated people spreading it. I just can’t deal with stupid people. https://t.co/nO4lmK7mWW
1512034705004183553	Had some bad news a few days before our wee break, was diagnosed with post covid fibrosis, they don't no enough about to say if it will get better or if it'll get worse.

1469811865924501507	@leepers500 @NickKave @chris_notcapn The most effective form of treatment for my kind of leukemia is not being administered by my oncology center due to the danger to patients from unvaccinated covid patients in the hospital.
1374799419803983874	Thankful to work for a job that immediately disclosed and shut us down for a positive COVID test Sad because I just got off unemployment and need moneys
1468137028802039811	Please, come to the hospital and tell me we’re lying about bed availability and covid cases because “everyone I know that had covid is doing pretty damn fine” okay 🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴
1490810791439781893	If the Covid narrative were true, everyone in downtown Ottawa would be either hospitalized with Covid or dead by now. I do not think the Canadian government would be panicking like this if it expected “Covid” to kill off the non-socially-distanced crowd. 😆
1388306440561983491	So yaa I was feeling so low from last few days and I have tested covid positive,and I have quarantined myself. My throat is paining, I have fever and my whole body is aching. I can't write more coz my fingers are literally paining. Stay safe everyone.
1455158017540902920	@MollyJongFast I personally know of 2 that was reported as something else. Both were in their 30s, men, were in the hospital for Covid. Released and 3 weeks later admitted again. The death certificates stated heart problems as cause of death. No mention of Covid, even though both still tested +
1395080932332277770	As the country starts going without masks remember  that even with the vaccine people can still get covid-19.  I'm now proof since I tested positive after our office started getting lazy about mask wearing and the unvaccinated mixed with the vaccinated.  🤬😷
1480677053020180480	The number of people hospitalized for #COVID19 in #Indiana also continues to rise. We did not quite (as I had expected) set a new record over the weekend but came close with 3,399 people hospitalized for the disease, or just 61 patients below a record. [3/5] https://t.co/IkxGkketMx
1379796745782235149	I wonder if health insurance companies will deny claims for people going into ER or hospitalizations with covid-19, but declined to get the vaccination? Seems like costly hospitalizations could be avoided but some people stubbornly won't get the vaccination
1387424772276035585	This poor kid. He started as a likely top-10 draft pick. Then he had a back issue. Now he's tested positive for COVID.I'm going to be a fan of his, no matter where he ends up. Will still probably hear his name called tomorrow night.#NFLDraft2021https://t.co/n86sXaXeHO

1508448997098377223	My husband has just been told by the covid app that he's been in close contact with someone who tested positive yesterday. That would be me, then 🤦🏽‍♀️
1438845817922727937	@Funzee8 @AuronMacintyre Don’t get a vaccination.  That’s your choice.  Don’t go to the hospital though if you get covid.   Stay the fuck home and deal with it.   And if you die from it or have long term health issues from it. well too fucking bad.   I don’t want to hear the bullshit though.
1550588026161573888	Guess who just tested positive for covid… and I’m really scared…
1435934534604922882	@globeandmail I have been warning of this for months we have in the United States roughly 100 thousand hospitals to serve 350 million people at this rate of hospitalized Covid patients our medical community is going to collapse with in the year is my prediction I specialized in ICU Trauma https://t.co/eIzMZZOi4O
1471344484134768642	While most RPhs aren't in the ER, stretching us is just as dangerous. I can't care for hundreds of patients on my own, certainly not 7 days/wk. When a pharmacy has no RPh, it can't open. Meaning pts go without meds, and some will need the ER instead. An ER full of COVID pts. 🧵
1550310439317393408	@cnnbrk I just took a Flowflex COVID test tonight and my test was positive too. I reported it to my state health department online. I've been double vaxxed and got a booster. So far, I can still taste my food a little but I can't smell much of anything.
1611539656180383745	@FrancineR1234 @TomFitton They are safe and effective? Is that why more people with them end back up with Covid and in the hospital? I don’t have one and I am great
1472891164718247936	@UKGastroDr My Nan died alone in hospital 2 days before this due to covid. Aged 97. Makes me so angry.
1470806677771407368	@EssexPR @wesstreeting @UKLabour Where's the previous variant of covid gone?When someone tests positive but have zero symptoms, like 95% of positive cases, how do they no what variant they've tested positive for?I thought labour would be all over the government for the parties last Christmas, silly old me.
1379585401623617551	Trump did better with COVID than Biden. A good example of it is the border. The border has been more secure during Trump's presidency than any other time. Biden is letting ANYONE in the country, some tested positive with COVID. I guess most people didn't think about that one.
1532294354802556929	Well looks like I finally got caught by COVIDLast night's test was negative but today's is positive Mostly just feeling grotty, like typical concrud really, hopefully it stays mild

1380155696931561479	Is it bad that I’m kind of excited about the possibility of spending 6 days in the hospital ALONE after finger surgery? (Might need a special treatment to make sure I heal properly and w/COVID restrictions id be alone.) Not quite a relaxing spa vacay but it’ll do. 🤷🏽‍♀️
1383223478204043267	Fam we still have a ways to go. Don’t let your guard down. I’m hear to bear witness this virus is real. Please continue to protect yourself.  I suffered from a severe case of Covid and was hospitalized from October 29th to December 10th. https://t.co/i4kxQwA7gR

1432477040045854727	@apsmunro @jcbarret Im an ICU nurse in Denmark. May i ask if the children who Are in hospital due to covid in the UK Are healthy/normal weight, or do they  usually suffer from comorbiditties?I Got a personal theory that obesity plays a big part in covid-hospitalizations, both in adult and kids.

1551590455082639362	@intercede007 @TheLoneWolfx @WilliamBoone93 @PrisonPlanet I’m not sure what article you’re referring to but hospitals are incentivized by claiming those hospitalized w/Covid are unvaxxed just as they are incentivized to ventilate &amp; treat patients with Rendesivir. Unvaxxed furthers the narrative &amp; those treatments fill their pockets w/$
1380323943177981952	@peregrinacf @whiskywhisky4 @Tokkemon @JoshuaTorrey @DavidAFrench This. I tested positive for Covid after my first dose. Had a fever over 100 for 5 days, was so sick I could barely get myself tested. That’s the alternative to skipping the 2nd dose. Covid is not a joke &amp; avoiding it is absolutely worth a day or two of flu symptoms, trust me
1430419611133128709	@abs_ripped @blacModerate @EricDJuly And a dozen of them have died in car accidents. 3 or 4 ODed. 1 or 2 are millionaires. And my graduating class was 202. So, less than 1 person is hospitalized with Covid.
1474141459934855174	@FlyMai16 This is my 2nd time w/ Covid. First was March-May this year - was hospitalized twice. It was serious. This time around, it feels like the flu, a hard flu, but none of the breathing problems I had the first time. My current symptoms began last Monday, so it’s been almost 2 wks now
1416038237697609728	@mrwk1954 @SWMarelise @SheelaghG @Plandemic10 Not childish - I still know of NOONE who has been admitted to hospital with covid never mind died of it.In the 16 month of a so called pandemic!And I don't live in a little bubble
1444214492250849291	@Alex_Neverm1nd @WADeptHealth You misunderstood vulnerably. Vulnerable people are those at high risk of hospitalization. I bet your child will be fine. Its the flu or less for healthy kids, kids have a higher rate of a major adverse reaction to the vaccine than being hospitalized from covid.
1531413188146737152	I tweeted this and then tested positive for Covid :0!
1429845809286184965	@DrReddyGI I rarely go to the ER, but have had to twice since the pandemic started.With 25 covid cases in my little antivaxtown rural hospital, I wouldn't go now unless I had a compound fracture or a heart attack.

1385066627591327752	@jaysondemar The value is that people find out what's happening around them; namely, that a small number of vaccinated people are contracting Covid/being hospitalized.  I want to know that so I can properly assess my risk.
1450802763600965635	I just read that double vaxxed Mayorkas tested positive for Covid. Maybe one of his 100s of thousands illegals he's letting in unvetted gave it to him.
1381151804927352833	@VarshaEGaikwad Nobody in India,Be it the central or the state government has take cognizance of students mental health.We are humans too,We have families.#MentalHealthMatters,Only Not for Students it seems.What if I test COVID Positive after I write my #boardexams2021 and infect someone?
1619049181653630976	@aazureway my work has a similar stupid fucking policy that no one has listened to. if you test positive but dont have symptoms you can still come in and work.i work retail.no one with two braincells to rub together is coming in with a positive covid test.
1384249937441918981	Just sat with my kids for two weeks while my wife slept all day and laid in bed with covid. I tested positive Friday and just got scolded because she didn’t get any work done today while I slept. Ok.
1379816110812446724	I don't think I can ever forgive this Government for the way they've handled Covid.We have a beloved family member in hospital who is struggling mentally, &amp; we can't even visit, let alone give them hugs they so desperately need right now. 😭CC: .@Buddha_aka_me.@transguysteve
1297044828090519553	Given the Tour’s relationship with drugs and testing I fully expect it will make a positive contribution this year to the search for a Covid 19 vaccine. Tour de France: teams will be expelled if two members test positive for Covid https://t.co/YTs8GuPUn8

1476754795893452802	@rpmerkow I had cancer surgery 11 months ago.  I was concerned about going into the hospital with Covid raging. Now I'm glad it was then and not now.
1382580967110418432	@iamZoomie Last week...had faced problems at every step...first no appointment for RTPCR...then result after 72 hours... Chest CT waiting for 2 hours... no bed available in hospital of my choice... Aadmi aadha to udhar hi thak jaata hai..Covid side pe reh gaya !!
1617334033981087744	@meggyface626 @DawnJohnsonGA @TheAndyCortez @AngeliaDesselle @elonmusk @ScottAdamsSays Well there are a lot of things one can do to potentially lesson symptoms, but governments pushed vax as the only solution and just told you all to go to the ER if you couldn't breathe.Also crazy to me to credit the vaccine to beating covid when so many do fine without it.
1549641052046368769	@JFA13041967 Why do all these people keep saying you won’t die from Covid if you’re vaxxed? I know more fully-vaxxed and boosted people who’ve died from Covid than unvaxxed. Why? All the fully-vaxxed people I know keep getting Covid, and several have ended up in the hospital. Why?
1396145775374000129	My atok sedara currently in icu ward and doctor said he's critical. Half of his lungs were damaged.. please doakan for him 🥺 Covid is real guys, take care of yourself

1436513385043005444	@xstoicunicornx @charley_ck14 Best of luck to you, and to whomever you may infect along the way who may not have the same low chance of not dying from it. May you never need to be hospitalized and keep needed treatment from other patients. When you get covid, I hope you don't end up having long hauler issues.
1384885766657126402	I was gonna do a lil health update and there will never be a good time so here it goes. I’ve been sick with long covid or post covid syndrome, real bad, since the first week of June 2020. Since I didn’t have a positive test it was 6 months of hell before I got traction.
1380347977835941893	If someone is due their second covid vaccine, but are currently an inpatient in hospital, I don’t understand why that vaccine can’t be organised?? Surely they are VULNERABLE, and a second vaccine is important? Local GP surgery is saying that they’ll have to wait until...
1468994781321871364	For everyone fretting over the number vaccine doses that might be needed for Covid I can tell you I have had 47 doses of the flu vaccine and only caught the flu once in my life. I didn’t need to go to the hospital and never even came close to dying from it. https://t.co/NKA9BGpodd
1393245290149335041	@Forequick9 @RadioFreeTom Yes the CDC messaging has been utterly confusing.   I am fully vaxxed: got the J&amp;J vax day before they paused its use.  No symptoms except pain at injection site.  Never have had any symptoms of Covid.  Tested twice in December when husband did.  He tested positive then
1477022900091772933	Tested positive for covid, RIP NYE plans. Wife is negative so far so I’m going to seal myself away in basement.
1478146242987319310	Interesting.  I checked the stats for my city and with 1000 active covid cases no one is I'm hosptial and no one in icu....in all of my region only 1 in hosptial and 1 in icu out of 4000 active covid cases. Why did they one everything and go virtual with school again?

1378256099879518216	@gaiasjourney I was diagnosed with covid on March 14th. Within five days I had double pneumonia. I was deathly ill. I was a hold out on the vaccines. I’m not anymore. I can tell you that NOTHING is worth the risk! I was making end of life plans with my family. I’m lucky to be here.
1579974153763196928	@iglesiasnuevas it is up to you how to utilize the data. When I am asked, I am comfortable recommending COVID-19 vaccine as benefit&gt;risk but I understand that this is polarized, and large sectors of my state have said “no way”. We will do our best for every patient hospitalized, always.
1386005304823984130	@EdoajoEric If I were managing a full panel of COVID19 in ICU, we wouldn't be here with cyproheptadine. The trial would have been done 6 months ago. I observe. Consulted on some. Some CCMs end up using cyproheptadine. I observe and observe and observe.
1385812086266077188	@Ken04989139 @Ryanxinchen @OvigweEguegu @Radicalism In November of 2919 I was diagnosed with a respiratory illness, later identified as Covid by two renowned pulmonologists. This was verified by the presence of Covid antibodies in my blood samples from the emergency room after the information on Covid was coming to light.
1412455409688981507	@johnpavlovitz COVID-19 mutates on an hourly basis.  This virus wants to live just like YOU want to live.I just wish you included that NONE of you are in the hospital on a ventilator because you are fully vaccinated.
1426516666716991489	@bod_uherald @williamhboney1 The GAA approach to the safety of is players is a joke. I know for a fact a county team fielded  a player 7 days after he tested positive for covid. Management and even the team doctor knew!
1538750229444370432	Still testing negative for Covid. :) Not that I’m complaining, of course XD. My next test is in five days, but so far, I’ve managed to dodge it despite everyone else in my house testing positive (holing up in my room has helped a lot XD). Let’s hope that streak continues.

1457333591357083651	@Jinx12271 @dcherring I see a double standard: An official covid injury/death only require a positive test within 30/60 days to be registered (it may have happen regardless)An official covid vaccine injury requires autopsies, follow-ups, research,  approvals, etc. Big Pharma has immunity regardless

1346301082218201090	@RealDoctorMike I have an interesting question for you regarding the Covid-19 vaccine. If someone tested positive a few months ago and survived it do they still need the vaccine? Shouldn't they have a built up immunity to it like Chicken Pox?

1377562661706104840	One week ago my husband was in the hospital with Covid and pneumonia. I was home all alone, also sick with Covid. I was afraid to fall sleep because I was afraid I'd have trouble breathing and no one was there to help. We're better now, but I'm still afraid to fall sleep.
1379619668076322816	@purpIeboa i’m hoping it’s not covid &lt;333 but i’ll say i only had a sore throat, got tested for school and was positive so just be careful!!!
1601880768606883843	Negatives: tested positive for Covid (I’m absolutely fine) and am still required in work.Positives: my black glasses/black mask with vent combo make me feel a bit like Shredder from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 🥷
1422988224905957376	@Don_Knight @DaveMic49712574 @marcorubio I would prefer zero children hospitalized with COVID.
1374796032157040640	I can't be with my baby in hospital due to covid19 but I know he's being looked after well by the @KHFTpaeds Nd my hubby. 2 nights the longest I've been away from him. I've given up chocolate to raise money for @TheBHF https://t.co/vg0ftCJYcj. https://t.co/yYikFnDzAC
1374471390774972424	@georgiaEtennant Sad because it's still tuesday and I can't wait for the weekend, but mostly very happy because at least the covid cases in the hospital where I work are at the lowest they've been since the pandemic started :)
1373033740247695362	@CNNPolitics I’m sure a lot of people have the antibodies and have no idea. I get tested every 6 weeks with a group of people. Many have tested positive after testing negative and never knew they had Covid
1409229592674672641	I am now used to this Covid19 nton' nton' 1st wave I was in Cape Town(Western Cape) with higher infections, 3rd wave I am in JHB(Gauteng) with highest covid19 infections, I tested positive twice as well. #Level4 #CyrilRamaphosa #GautengCOVID19
1394376475759964160	@EmberQuintenn Am Arun from INDIA,My wife (27yrs)is critically ill and admitted in hospital ICU (PAST 36 DAYS)due to serious infection,brain damage which not related to Covid. On this situation,any contribution will help us fight the situation. https://t.co/yXJMnRLQ62 https://t.co/T7Fj4iwT2i
1553064028074872833	Actually gutted that I managed an entire pandemic not catching covid and I’ve just tested positive with it for the first time 😭Never felt this kind of ill ever
1543061200568782850	@gayandmean so i had covid in january and im a nanny. while sleep training, i took off my mask, stood over the baby's crib and shushed her the day before i tested positive and she was fine. so fingers crossed!
1428942471480762595	@TheRealHoarse Drove my car for the first time since Apr 16. I wasn't vaccinated yet when I contracted COVID. In hospital for 3 mths. Medical induced coma. I almost died. Home care/physio has ended. Muscle strength improving. I have always been healthy but will never take my health for granted.
1339612416607473666	"@MrMichaelBurkes I just hope if people dont get it, they dont get REALLY sick with covid then end up in the hospital on a ventilator and say to themselves,  ""DAMN wish I would have gotten the vaccine"". Just saying."
1510193754681995268	@loz31063748 @N_J_Bennett @NSWHealth So tell me how many of the 96% vaxxed and the 4% vaxed are vulnerable to dying from covid 🙄 Not all of NSW is in danger of ever ending up in hospital let alone death.
1545682856059748353	@DemianeukTania @PRGuy17 I was diagnosed with covid this week. Despite having 4 covid jabs, wearing masks all the time at the shops and using sanitisers it got me. Thank you to the ratbags that can't do a simple thing like wearing a mask correctly, over the nose, under the nose doesn't work. 1/1
1459169810684817409	@Marco_Poloo23 I haven’t been to the hospital not once and I’ve had “COVID” twice.... what’s your point....
1554135158097321984	AND HE TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVID THIS MORNING.  I just washed the makeup off my face and changed into my house clothes. https://t.co/kSXmRV6R4B
1441407845522558985	Two positives, one negative, and a question mark (me)...Still no symptoms, but after a second positive for #COVID in the house, getting tested again (was planning to in a couple days anyway...)
1411962871517380609	@9NewsSyd @cokeefe9 Why aren’t you reporting on the 5 NSW Covid cases in ICU? I thought they’d be headlining the news... unless they’re actually vaccinated, like the NSW Minister who couldn’t lift his head off the pillow for a week after coming down with Covid. https://t.co/cNrHzbwZx7
1472777555895795712	How many people do you know who have tested positive for COVID within the last month and were they vaccinated or unvaccinated? Let me know. Curious.
1414205880556523524	I am trying to find compassion for people getting sick, being hospitalized, being put on ventilators, etc in spiking Covid waves down South. But I just can’t. I exhaust myself just thinking about their utter stupidity.
1387803168814379014	@DrakosArts I mean to be faaaaaaaaaiir even if u get covid while vaccinated there aren't any recorded instances (to my knowledge) of people being hospitalized for it so as long as vaccination is required then it should be safe enough.  But I heard that's not the case so fuck that
1383276876181872640	My tl is jusI tested covid positive ...Or sm Dr. talking abt the high rise, well its jus scary 😶😶
1478778317302022145	Family I have just tested positive for COVID.
1372877718962978819	@GovCanHealth @JustinTrudeau Covid Alert is a joke, does not work. I was in the hospital for a cat scan. I am sitting across an elderly man. There was another man  on a stretcher in the aisle waiting. As we were all waiting, the elderly man’s Covid Alert app went off. Mine never did.
1480389559074578432	@rego_arego896 As far as test goes, test yourself twice to make sure it’s not a false positive. As far as the piggies, I would avoid handling them and maybe wearing a mask when you do need to be with them. Go to the CDC website they have a section on pets when owners have covid.
1513418383311749129	@Amalgamquietude This is true. I was in the extremely vulnerable group. I caught covid in Jan 2021. I had only been out to hospitals and INR checks at my GP’s. I refused to go into hospital as I did want to burden the doctors with the decision to leave me in a corner to treat someone younger.
1429203712392654848	@kglarson @ASlavitt Care to elaborate on that? Of people currently hospitalized in my county for #Covid 85% are unvaccinated. And they’re unvaccinated bc they listen to the ppl who don’t give a shit about them. The callousness on the Right is reprehensible. THAT’s “insane”.
1524792407753166849	Well, turns out it is covid! I was full on sick and still tested negative.  Going on day 3 before showing positive.WHO LET ME STREAM 36 HOURS WITH COVID?!?! 😂 https://t.co/4McrVMPMgf
1386834396922122245	Remember when Tanzania tested the DNA of a goat and a pawpaw and they came back positive for covid19??I DO. I TWEETED ABOUT IT.That leader of Tanzania is now dead at age 61.Watch starting at 40:15 - 43:48https://t.co/RrOi0QhuIu

1424511525084090368	Lolla folks. How many of y’all tested positive for Covid. ? So far I know of one person 👀
1415408962111827970	@leoniedelt I'm assuming this is one of those tests that test for IgG and IgM?You do realise they are some of the most common antibodies in the human body? Testing positive for IgG and IgM doesn't make any link to SARS-cov2 /Covid.Please correct me if I'm wrong.
1455269270762496010	It took me Buffy being hospitalized for covid to find our she was a Trump supporter. I don't think it's funny but I'd like to identify a pattern
1473625884355661830	@POTUS Rapid test don’t work!  I am positive with COVID and the rapid test came out negative when the other one came out positive I took the rapid test twice and came out negative!  It simply doesn’t work!
1354127856775929859	The coronavirus vaccine has been stringently tested and is 99% effective and the main road out of the pandemic.If I've had the jag why do I still have to isolate if I'm in contact with someone who is positive?Because we don't know if it stops you catching covid???!!!
1402717873898987529	@Natalia01Mateo This is the wrong message to send to Canadians.  I wasn't allowed to see my Nan in the hospital before she died because of Covid restrictions.  I guess her life means less?  You make us follow rules and you decide who doesn't have to follow them!
1481034865638359046	First run since Kiawah on 12/10.  Tested positive for Covid 12/21.  Got wind resistance from beard now? That’s a lot going against me. LOL.  I’ll take the results.  Dam to Dam relay coming up in 7 weeks. Lake Murray to Lake Greenwood w/ 5 others. Then taking spring and summer off https://t.co/s3oRhxceBJ
1370450296812367872	I have been so strict with my #covid safety practices, getting tested weekly due to my work w/ #teachers &amp; #kids. 3 weeks after being fully vaccinated, my last test came back positive. I’m asymptomatic. Quarantining @home. The vaccine is working. Symptoms are minor. Go get yours! https://t.co/FPKbtZv7H3
1477411219480870913	So I got tested just now and I’m positive for COVID so I’ll be off for a while longer TwT
1487056405324603398	While I'm all for people being able to choose - and the vaccine doesn't prevent COVID, it's just like the flu shot. Would you rather be out of commission for a week or more; or in the hospital? - or instead just have a mild cold-like thing going on?
1511662928944300033	hello, i'm sorry to bring bad news on this afternoon. i tested positive for corona both self-diagnostic kit and a rapid antigen test. to honor my muse so i'll minimize interaction in timeline; don't worry, i'll recover. keep your health everyone, jiwoo loves you! 🥺🤍 https://t.co/OWlNmy77PB
1479061002922573832	I’m in the ICU rn but recovering well, stay safe from COVID y’all this isn’t just a “cold or flu”. Really hits you very hard man get the booster get vaxxed
1488171706116100099	@JustinTrudeau Hi - I have tested positive for COVID today and I am triple vaccinated and my entire family is vaccinated.Please do your part and get vaccinated - it’s the ONLY way to stop COVID and to get out of this pandemic!!! 🤦‍♂️How stupid do you think the Canadian people are?
1391060551913152514	@Femi_Sorry @PhilScottMRTPI I hope the government sues you for this awful spread of fake news!!! Even the BBC state it’s deaths with a positive Covid test in the last month! Not deaths OF Covid!!
1552459297040150528	Annnnnnddd I tested positive for COVID. Damn I was so sure it was just a cold
1471657519638630402	@KellDA Don’t go. Follow me for more survival tips. Tuesday in Chicago I had an all day indoors work day plus social event. Next morning: “we want inform you that you were in close contact with a person who tested positive for coronavirus after developing symptoms overnight.”
1354887780149694466	@lunanatic Do you know what happens when someone goes into Hospital for treatment @lunanatic do they have to have a Covid test or a vaccine before hand? (I know it's unlikely anybody gets in the NHS now unless they've got Covid or a broken leg) just wondering?
1375130859737595907	@BerylAunty @SetSpeed @HugoGye @dseddon91 I mean, you might argue based on that study - if you hadn't read it.Unfortunately it relies not on confirmed death data, but instead the death within 28 days of a Covid positive test data.Seriously flawed.But such is the poor standard of scientific literature today.
1462405030456274947	@RoyalFreeChty and @RoyalFreeNHS have provided me with treatment and support when I was diagnosed with #epilepsy in the middle of COVID19. As you can imagine this was a huge shock and change of life. Without their support this would have hit much harder. https://t.co/cIBYRpgfqb
1391906043861557248	I saw yesterday, for the first time, an ad for those who test positive for Covid to contact their doctors about getting the antibody medicine. Regeneron is very effective but we aren't getting it out there. Why isn't some organization shipping Regeneron to India? I want to know.
1373362626214961153	I have tested positive for Covid.
1555712855156043776	@ClaireFosterPHD @Timcast That miracle drug nearly put me in the hospital, and I still got COVID. Shill elsewhere. Plus, as a Ph.D., you could probably do better with your grammar.
1377361541113122816	Tested positive for covid but will still be able to do what I do from home... except golf😔
1601612621320716288	It's 00:19am now, The day after I was diagnosed with covid, but I think everything will get better soon.Johnny said have a nice day or nice dream! 💤 https://t.co/vilUgCiWv3
1409705491719065600	@maiamimi I had the shakes &amp; was feverish, but that means the vaccine was doing what it should be doing. My system is sensitive due to an autoimmune disease, so it is worth a night of discomfort to not be hospitalized with covid.
1489383934752440323	@SexCounseling @DawnSoares1 While I will agree with you, I was blessed that they just supported me. I was in the ICU for two weeks on a vent, iv antibiotics. I had covid and the flu.
1432575407891435520	I was diagnosed w covid not too long ago
1521520631426129921	Yesterday I tested positive for COVID. I don't feel good but can only imagine how bad it'd be w/o vaccines &amp; boosters.Unfortunately, this means that after 2 years of remote desk I'm going to miss the first week of #OWL2022 in our new truck, but hope is I can join remotely. 🤞 https://t.co/9LOkDAZEen
1429261431086583811	Covid is dead ass real and people are dying. If you get sick and go to the hospital.. you’re taking away medical care for someone who ACTUALLY NEEDS IT (i.e: Cancer patients) People laugh like its a joke. Fuck you!  Prevention: mask, vaccine, not going to crowded places.
1401953009614180355	"@light_bex @GemzME @RichardTofts @Telegraph Really? ""many""? As someone in the first wave, my ""treatment"" was ""stay at home unless you need to be hospitalized"" and my official diagnosis was based on symptoms - when I was finally able to see a doctor specializing in treating covid patients, 9 months post-symptom onset. 1/2"
1598414119505371138	Hi everyone, sorry for the lack of videos from my YouTube channel as of late. The reason why is because I tested positive for Covid a couple of days ago. Thankfully, I am making a slightly good recovery at the moment but I will update you all on when I am feeling fully better.
1482067344025436160	If that test didn’t tell me I was positive I legit would’ve had no idea I have Covid
1548755777069821953	If I've spent any time with anyone recently i just tested positive for covid so getting tested would be smart!
1444045947051331586	Negative #covid test means I’m coming home this weekend. Was almost hoping for a positive to be “stuck” in Europe for a few more days…#vacation #greece
1614037789363822592	@ScottAdamsSays My stress levels got high when I was going into the hospital with COVID back in 2021. After I got out the stress levels were back to normal. Stress levels got high again when it seemed like my employer was going to mandate the clot shots. They didn't, stress levels back to normal
1379403521041301507	Yesterday the nurse called, asked me a million ?s &amp; told me to come to the hospital Friday so they can do a non stress test on my baby. She said she'll be calling everyday, same time to monitor my symptoms. Idk if that's reg covid protocol but I feel very taken care of
1434219067003613185	"@rdumont99 I've read that after some arbitrary period of time, BC's rulers don't count patients hospitalized due to Covid in the census of hospitalized Covid patients.""If you don't take a temperature, you can't find a fever"" - Law X, House Of God."
1353980763004416000	Fuck that Vaccine too many people had covid around me and all of my tests came back negative. I literally quarantined with Covid patients twice and never caught it. If I test for antibodies I probably test Positive ...so what does that tell you ❓
1449920274984538113	michaela’s funny af bc her mind was just not in the right place at all when zach tested positive for covid but I’m also confused as to why she had to go back home 🤔
1454155888105705472	Just got my Covid booster and my flu shot. My nurse said he contracted Covid last year and was hospitalized twice. He’s still struggling with long Covid and the effects of taking so many steroids for so long.

1475727449682067456	@BenAsskren @MythinformedMKE I know more vaxxed people that have caught covid more than once and some even hospitalized, than i do unvaxxed people.
1382083191884939266	Was told that I didn't have the virus - right at the start of lockdown - hadn't visited any high risk countries. Was told to self isolate - when I came out of that isolation Mum was diagnosed with Covid, passed away days later
1375484776623304708	I think some people need to understand that from now &amp; over the next few months COVID cases are going to rise sharply, yes, but the numbers aren’t relevant anymore, because cases will no longer correlate to hospital admissions &amp; deaths, both of which will continue to decline.
1538824210164109312	@Rosie72988852 @Buckette84 Next tweet - ‘I’ve tested positive to covid. Thankfully I’ve had all 4 of my booster shots or it would of been much worse’

1473709122713489410	@Bossy_Leah Correct.Mathematically, their claim makes no sense. 203 million Americans have been fully vaccinated. If the vaccine works as they say it does, there should be way less Covid patients in the hospital than at any time during the year when there was no vaccine at all.I

1377629855936880640	@jensblog @erinhaust @UlwellingRacing I think YOU haven’t been paying attention to medical facts about the vaccine Ppl who have had Covid Or been vaccinated Are far less likely to get it again - even from differing strains If they do - very, very few get hospitalized and NO ONE dies So her question is fair
1427713132038864898	@BethRigby What a great idea....I was fed up with your 'gotcha' questions totally unrelated to Covid issues during the Govt's COVID briefings. Why did you never ask things like how many Covid 'cases' were actually ill...age...in hospital...for how long...discharge rate etc etc ....
1614077019599564801	@CCINDYT7 @GrantCardone @LisaPresley How many of those diagnosed with Covid actually died from the vaccine? How many of those had the rubbery blockages throughout their veins. With all going on now I would say it’s wise to dig in and do the research. Problem is they know there’s hell to pay if vax proves the problem
1477936140212707328	Thank god for that. I can go to the UK today!**as you can test positive for a while after recovering from Covid, I’d been probably a little irrationally worried I’d test positive, not be able to travel, and also have to do a follow up PCR and potentially isolate again https://t.co/GRsVJ7LNeC

1529206351611604993	I am deeply touched by the support I have been getting from the community while I recover from Covid. My symptoms actually got pretty severe, enough for me to go to the ER, where I got the monoclonal antibodies. I'm on the mend, and I should be getting to everyone's photos soon!!

1577653209631690752	I had covid, we don’t have hepa filters. My spouse kept their distance most of the time but we def shared space before I tested positive and after the 6th day, and they never got covid. They tested every other day. So no.
1384440516582907905	I've never waited so long in the ER before, even with Covid. This is absolutely shameful. Never ever coming back here.
1481134616350056448	Tested positive for Covid. Symptoms are mild due to me being vaccinated yet it's a very unpleasant experience.
1452939593632915457	@maskupfolks @PaulBateman3 @zylon9 😂cases of what presenting at ERs resulting in a 1 night admission? I doubt they presented with covid if they tested positive up 28 days prior, you’ve just been suckered by whoever manipulated the figures for the first graph!
1477316988431216641	@JamesWard73 What I don’t understand is why so much patients hospitalized because of Covid apparantly are not in need of mechanical ventilation. For what other reason would they be there? Is this not an indication that a lot of them are in hospital with Covid and not so much because of?

1404481704803201029	@CZEdwards Ah so both his high ferritin level and his very high troponin level indicates cellular damage.  I would like to see a random study with peoples labs post vaccine,  asymptomatic and not, and also labs of people who had covid where they were hospitalized and were asymptomatic.

1382318227431305216	@telekinetica I definitely support people getting the vaccine, as I know a lot of people who were hospitalized from covid.  With that said, I can't blame someone for not getting it and the shaming is a little out of control.

I spent 3 days in June ‘20 in hospital for an infection. Our medical group sends Covid+ to one hospital, all else to another.
1427958050082770948	I sincerely don’t understand this. Won’t the folks with mild symptoms/asymptomatic be the ones using these sites? Weren’t the RCTs of monoclonal antibody therapy conducted among hospitalized COVID patients? #epitwitter were there studies on outpatient use that I missed?

1457612543929765892	@EricDJuly @beinlibertarian I got Covid last week despite being vaccinated since April. It wasn't as bad as it probably would have been if I wasn't vaccinated because of my respiratory issues, but I still got it. They even automatically took us all to the ICU for an artificial antibodies transfusion.

1374279132373213186	@MerrynSW I’m afraid it’s very selfish to think of ones own pain. You must think of those with an average age 82 and who had positive Covid test within 28days who’ve been stolen from us with their whole life ahead of them. Oh take your vaccine be scared &amp; worship the NHS.#BorisJohnsonOut
1399818429159378950	I do wish people would realise that if you die within 28 days of a positive covid test it doesn’t mean that you died of covid. If you die in a RTA within 28 days of that covid test you count as a covid death although covid didn’t kill you.
1383683527552602121	Indeed sir, Even I was in ICU for few days due to H1N1, both H1N1 and Corona quite similar flu in seriousness.This was in 2017.. Before I met you in Istanbul in 2018.
1382544780660445186	The argument of “if I get covid I’ll survive I’ve got a strong immune system” just feels so wrong to me. Ok so you’ll be ok but you’ve now spread it to other people and they’ve spread to others and eventually someone will die or get hospitalized but that’s ok because you’re ok.

1436953325191241730	Well it was only a matter of time, thankfully though nothing much changes in my day to day life except for going to work.Tested positive for covid. Not worried as it's essentially a common cold right now. The runny nose is annoying tf out of me tho...
1427031657459093507	@TravisSmithRP @DonnieDinkle @ShardiB2 I NEVER said I wanted u or anyone else to get COVID.That’s why I advocate for the vaccine. If u don’t get the vaccine, u have a very good chance of getting COVID. Odds are NOT in your favor. Chances are I won’t get COVID, be hospitalized or worse. Statistics &amp; science don’t lie.
1512406380199690240	I'm kinda scared to admit I haven't gotten covid.But to be honest someone could convince me I was in the hospital on a ventilator and I'd believe because the last 2 years have been an absolute fire in a sewerage plant

1466298616851673088	@theclam I read somewhere  yesterday that if you have had a recent jab your COVid test could possibly show positive because of the spike, yet you could be negative? Anyone know how true this is?
1475606219226234883	@Megawatts55 I agree to some extent. But also, I had Covid a couple of months ago and tested negative before I tested positive (while symptomatic). We need more accurate home testing or cheaper and faster laboratory testing.

Zero!! I may have heard of 2 or 3 that went to the hospital. For 99.9% of them it's a mild to moderate case of the flu.

1479145340636913675	@pupboyla You're vaccinated and healthy no? I caught covid before the vaccines were even out and it wasn't great but was like having a flu. You're not gonna end up in hospital. But I get what you mean. If it can be done remotely and they won't let you, maybe it isn't the job for you?

1422663818589528067	LNP are ok with some of us dying from Covid. Even if I was vaccinated &amp; caught it, it would kill me. A cold I caught in March lasted 4 months, 3 trips to hospital.I would much prefer a peaceful, pain free, less costly death by VAD…but it’s mostly the LNP who are against that.
1480520376853618692	@oibusiness @JamesfWells My guess would be people who were not treated or diagnosed due to covid restrictions/no GP appointments and all the people who were illegally given DNRs so would have normally have survived

1601952623300644864	@SteveDeaceShow For some reason you'll continue to test positive for covid 90 days after infection which gives a 3 month window for them to count your death as a covid death.

1387556369583247365	@henrymcmaster What a reckless thing to say.  The reason why Covid hasn’t spread like wildfire is BECAUSE of masks when children have been diagnosed with Covid inside a classroom. Not a single chile has been vaccinated. I can’t wait until November.

I think @BorisJohnson was threatened/compromised when he went in to ICU with coronavirus, I think @realDonaldTrump is in hiding after a failed assassination attempt. I think this vaccine is the final stage. #help
1351232808744841224	In a twist of fate my foundation year rotations have meant I spent 4 months in ICU caring for some of the sickest patients with COVID, but today I vaccinated my first patient with the COVID vaccine in GP 😌 https://t.co/GMLalZYYLm
1486432733773524992	@cookingfor5 @MeghanMcCain @DailyMail I was speaking of my own personal experience.  I know a lot of people who have tested positive for covid. Not one has ended up in the hospital or died. Again MY experience so not a false narrative.
1476613305938632704	@pulte Hey Pulte I just tested positive for Covid. Could you help with my groceries so I can get them delivered? $ckas7 https://t.co/KyP4IVDHG1
1376855482925785092	@sweetsummer_t @jharvs9 @NC_Governor EVERYONE is vulnerable. The virus doesn't give a shit if you have no medical issues or if you have 20 medical problems....you can catch covid and die. Period. I work in ICU as a nurse, prove me wrong.
1440423317437968392	@caulmick I got my vaccine at my GPs. I have appointments in the hospital on a regular basis. Had two covid tests for procedures (December/February)
1427651326901690380	"After 4 weeks off, Jon Rahm said his second COVID+ was ""a little harder to digest"" than the one that bounced him from Memorial. Couldn't explain it: Tested 5 days; only one was positive. Still, no-go for the Olympics.""Still makes me a little sad, I'm not going to lie."""
1443942962388365317	@RachelNotley We should be seeing a precipitous decline in covid numbers correlated to dose uptake. 75% of Albertans 12+ have their shots, 87% 1/2. Instead, cases are up 15x. ICU up 20X. Hospitalized up 40x. Either the numbers are wrong or something else is wrong. I’ll let you figure it out.
1380887259029856261	On Monday Rhys, Vida + I all tested positive for Covid. It's been a rough week, especially isolating with a very active toddler.Fingers crossed we're through the worst of it now.Stay safe everyone, the pandemic is not over yet. 😷♥️
1387278654468608006	one of my kids threw up in class today and i sent her home which is fine but someone else tested positive for covid and i tested negative and i’m vaccinated and it’s like fine but i didn’t even get a lunch break because we were shortstaffed i— early childhood ed is The Bad Place
1530497992545148928	Handed in my final uni assignment for the semester just in time for Dave to test positive to covid 🙃
1392332552833146884	This day last year I found out I had Covid 😩 came home from Vegas and couldn’t smell or taste SHIT. Went into the hospital for an entire week &amp; was 2% away from being on a ventilator. I couldn’t breathe or barely move w/o choking. Couldn’t eat, sleep, drink. A mf miracle, truly.

1429614762913005570	@SauloLondono Why do I go in the ER with a n95 just for them to make me take it off so I can wear a surgical mask instead and then oops I get Covid?
1521363956157521920	Not sure about Josh telling me “the worst of the pandemic is behind us” when it appears that the precautions- free Bathurst show might have been a super spreader event and I tested positive for Covid this morning.
1483797789507305477	@HowardNick789uk @SkyNews Has been all along. There are still people going into hospital for fairly routine operations in their 70s getting Covid and dying. Happened to my neighbour so are the public saying that’s ok then because they were poorly and old they’re expendable!
1525104808151207937	These covid protocols make no sense. You mean to tell me I have to go back to work in 5 days of having tested positive for covid, but my kid can't go back to school for 2 weeks??? @GovMurphy you're killing me here. Wtf are we supposed to do with my kid now when I go back to work?
1488888517765828615	I tested positive for covid today :(
1317583578939727873	@fasting_crusade @Dreamweasel @realDonaldTrump Colds don't cause people to be admitted to the hospital.I take it you are not a supporter of the COVID vaccine?  Wonder why Trump is rushing one so desperately if it isn't that serious.
1480750057108430855	The person who very likely gave me covid when I had it back in 2020 just tested positive again. I guess that’s one benefit of him having a new gf who won’t let him hang out with me https://t.co/oDm8jJTb4E
1380626033074966529	Glad I saved my last COVID stimulus check because this week I spent it all on two trips to the ER for COVID treatment.
1479771891820896257	@Drothvader Yeah, this feels like a 24 hour bug heading into a head cold, but it has to be COVID, because I never leave the house and hubby tested positive 3 times now. I’m so glad if it had to happen, it happened at this time, since I am high risk. Also glad to be vaccinated.
1380663141428695040	What the hell #Michigan ?! We out did #Florida in #Covid cases?!!We're yet again high-risk!

1548101793007034372	@shewithcapitalV I was supposed to go to @Ascot in June but didn’t go because I tested positive on that morning. Now they refuse to refund my tickets saying it was my choice and they would be perfectly happy for me to go into that crowd with Covid. Go figure.

1419426487455866884	@errjustsaying @actiontiff So why are almost all covid patients vaccinated in lots of countries.  They should not be so I'll they are in hospital.  The covid patients should be the unvaccinated,  it being such an infectious critical illness.
1426314687889637378	@karl1711 @LisaMarieBoothe I don’t believe that there’s anyone who’s gotten Covid two times. I believe there’s some people who due to the bad PCR test might have gotten a false positive and then got more false positives or actually finally got CovidSurvive Covid = lifetime natural immunity
1436581724356587526	@tshepom35622623 @OHeart29 @Zoemkoena People who have been vaccinated are ending up in hospital ICU. I wasnt vaccinated during the second wave and had covid with flu like symptoms for only 3 days.So does everyone need to vaccinate???
1480398829354565632	I'm terrified of the respiratory stuff that comes along with covid because I've been hospitalized twice with pneumonia because I can't breathe. I have to go to the dentist tomorrow and I don't want to.
1374848066398908420	@Sloths7777 Today, on the anniversary of the day I was admitted to the hospital with Covid, I got my second dose of vaccine. https://t.co/Wscy2b9CRH

1551227802221150208	@TestOfTempest At the height of the pandemic it was basically mandatory to test every week, not including times you got contact traced and informed you were near someone else who was covid positive. So for me, well over 80 times

1503566180954562565	@kathygriffin @BarackObama Can we all agree that Kathy Griffin has tested positive for things much worse than Covid? She’s 100% Hollywood’s “I slept with a Ginger”
1425449683623637004	@bennessb I had to go to the hospital for routine maintenance yesterday and my nurse was telling me about how they’re seeing vaccinated people with COVID there. They’re all immunocompromised people. The vaccines just don’t take as well for them. She got choked up over it. It fucking sucks.
1476909431795458048	I love this story - a guy who was on BBC news in hospital with Covid put “award winning crisis actor” in his Instagram bio, some tinfoils gammons found it, took it seriously, and have ran with it. Beyond satire.
1402699030568779779	@momof3turkeys @Fraserhealth @DrVictoriaLeeFH I refused and agreed to put their surgical mask on over the top. When I asked why I was told that putting on one of their 'fresh' masks prevents my bringing Covid into the hospital on my 'used' mask. (I'd just put on my new mask.) Consultant, (N95 mask), didn't refer to my mask.

1542744139166617600	@ClemensLode @fitterhappierAJ Death WITH Covid is not death FROM Covid. You could die from diabetes complications — or a heart attack — and that swab will return positive. You can’t deduce anything from that! I can assure you, endless waves and reinfections are not a thing here. Why?👇🏾https://t.co/PWk4KKL5wd
1422719376977842179	@winesellingMark @MrNielsen14 @OregonGovBrown Maybe @MrNielsen14 would like to express his opinions about Covid to my patient in the ICU with Covid.  Unfortunately he will be too late because he died today.  He, like so many others fell for the lies that you have spread.  You guys are the sheep.
1431466382860832769	I dunno. Maybe get vaccinated or, maybe not run to the hospital when you’re sick with covid because you chose not to get vaccinated. Other people are dying because of that silly choice you think is so grand. Sissies.
1374204593438035972	Currently in Riverside County:135 COVID patients in the hospital. Lowest since 10-9-20. Only TWELVE days have had a lower COVID hospital count since I started tracking on 6-18-20.31 COVID in ICU. Lowest EVER recorded since I started tracking on 7-16-20.
1375326182036606977	Please take covid serious, I know yall have heard it 183737 times and are over hearing it but somebody I care about is fighting for his life right now in ICU and he's in his 20's.

1481825693851807747	I just got an email from my kid’s school saying one of my kid’s classmates tested positive for COVID and anyone at school yesterday was directly exposed. And what were we told to do? Send our kids to school tomorrow!
1453774126276042753	It had to happen I guess..After reporting on 500 stories since Dec 19 (mainly Covid),I see first-hand what it’s like to test positive 😳Thinking of all those who’ve been impacted by Covid - patients, families, &amp; amazing #NHS medical teams- and so grateful for the vaccines https://t.co/kxPAtyvLTy
1384295060670279683	@independent786 @Reptoid_Hunter Sure I’ll be clear. Since you seem to@be the only one who didn’t understand. The fact that I was tested specifically for Covid-19 and tested positive is the proof. I’ve had sinus infections before but the symptoms I had with Covid, were much more severe. When you have an earache
1503614397100478466	@arobertsonphoto @sajidjavid They didn’t come into hospital because of COVID where I work and the majority are double and triple jabbed.

1384111931154329604	My running tally of ppl I know personally who are fully vaccinated and have contracted Covid is 5. I wonder how they got it/who they gave it to before they tested positive.
1380563758372827139	@drdrew I know two people who have been hospitalized from the COVID vaccine and one that died. How about making it even simpler, fuck off Drew.
1559435401743310848	@AlbertBourla I never tested positive for Covid 19 and never got a single vax, which makes me thankful for my natural immunity.
1447902161082400773	@davidmweissman I know many who have had Covid &amp; some of those hospitalized.  Numerous have long term &amp; 1 died. Still, some refuse to get vaccinated.  I don’t get it! Hubby/I are vaccinated &amp; still mask being 70 yrs old. Covid is NOT the flu!
1478019204179767307	So sick update. I probably have COVID. I do not know 100% bc tests are all sold out in my area but I was in contact with someone who tested positive and I have the symptoms.

1519440354390519815	Current problem. I have no idea what my areas covid risk is. Covid count is listed at zero for weeks. In the past few days, 3 people in my circle tested positive for covid. Media reports vaguely reference rising cases. This is not enough info for good decisions.
1456297127198576643	@stache_stash @carlie_shannon Yes Covid. Considering the post I’m replying to, it’s easily inferred. But here is confirmation that yes, Covid is why he is hospitalized. The embolisms were caused by it.
1377731802278813701	I tested positive for COVID today &amp; this sht is nothing to play with. A whole year of working in the hospital without getting it &amp; it hit me hard af.

1373682025987780609	@CromwellStuff I am baffled too!! In a real pandemic you wouldn’t test yourself to see if you have had the virus!! I tested kids for two weeks in a school for Covid and not a single kid was positive over 10 days, but they are all brainwashed, there cleaning like no tomorrow!!
1478997598786801664	@GregoryCanning5 @DBienkiewicz @vespasji @TechnicallyRon Source please. I’d be willing to bet you mean 40% of those in hospital WITH covid. And I’d also be willing to be that the total is pretty low. 40% of 3 people isn’t much for example.
1384544840155754497	@CreativeDavidT I am nearly diagnosed of a cancerous prostate spanning 12 months of tests and WebMD matches. Will know in a week or two.  Forget COVID, I am more worried about a surgery and aftermath.

1425804010192310277	People asking what the side-effects are of the vaccine. 1, where have you been?2, millions didn't catch covid so bad that I went to the hospital and died. No I haven't caught covid yet because I'm vax'ed and masked.

1355320069870514176	A Publix pharmacy in Cape Coral saw delays in getting prescriptions filled due to the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. I spoke with a woman who has multiple sclerosis who says she almost ended up in the hospital because she couldn't get her meds: https://t.co/sgpIxpmCeB
1459439687756623874	/ hey y'all, it tirns out my absence will be longer, since my covid test came back positive. i'm fucking scared. 😭
1373558067711807488	@lefty_here_ my understanding is no company promised no infection..only promise was no risk of complications from covid or mortality and that too at 90% efficacy. it could also be that a person is covid infected already but diagnosed only one or two days after vaccination
1449853163490750466	Dude is documenting invisible shit thats flying from the sun, thru the earth, and recording its existence 10 atoms at a time in a tank filled with fluid 1 mile underneath the earth, while my antivaxx fam member nearly dies in the hospital from covid but he says it wasnt that bad.
1437951974893182976	@ThavasRas @nzherald Surely if they had a test then they would have been advised covid rules? Who tested positive? I assume all MM are now in MIQ along with close family members being tested regularly @chrishipkins @jacindaardern @AshBloomfield I hope these were not the gang who attended Tangi?
1594705283632500736	Calling all #SymfonyCon2022 participants! Please be aware that I have tested POSITIVE for COVID19 and that first symptoms have appeared on Saturday, November 19, 2022.Take extra care and test yourselves in case of any symptoms. Especially those who I might come in contact with

1379048767526146049	(2) After hours and hours of Pt and Treatment all winter.  I was only around the person who tested positive for less than 10 minutes.  In addition, I have already had COVID in the past (mostly asymptomatic), and TESTED NEGATIVE since being contact traced, yet there is no way...

1454863628197249025	@sheryld64646160 @ZubyMusic An obese vaxxed person is more likely to spread covid and end up in the hospital than I am. I’m healthy and am covid recovered. Should we put fat people on calorie counts? Obesity is our real public health crisis.
1346532333160165378	I don't know how accurate this figure is, but I can say this much. When I went to hospital for my blood tests, there was a steady stream going in for vaccination here.BBC News - 1.3 million in UK have had their Covid vaccinehttps://t.co/EchJqH8Muh
1417531092949782531	@RAFALOCA1 @ActuaryByDay @kmpanthagani @COVID19actuary Well, I agree with that.  But the week of July 11, appx 800 people 65+ in the UK where hospitalized.  About 91% of 65 and above are fully vaxxed.  That's appx. 11 million people.  40% of hospitalizations are vaccinated.

Despite being cautious and maintaining social distancing and wearing a mask etc, I have germophobia and OCD so do the math
1377663103534522368	20% known deaths from Covid acquired in hospital when being treated for other illness. Appalling. NHS need to answer no excuses.I witnessed empty handgel at entrance to hospital and not one NHS staff entering a ward used the hand gel.All touching the door. Total lack of hygiene.
1541909266126315521	@CovidHse @RealDeniseWelch Lots of people i know have covid atm, none directly caught from hospitals. All feel awful and it’s lingering, none in hospital. Lots of people i know also seem to have issues with blood clots, 3 fatal after operations in the last two weeks. Thats just on my world. Stay safe x
1377481937313529859	@ABC i decline i just read a woman took her second dose of the Moderna vaccine and tested positive for Covid. i also read a congressman as well also was vaccinated only to test positive a month later for the virus. these vaccines needs more development.

1418254139830640642	@ChadCantRead @Timcast I’m treating the COVID vaccine like I do the flu shot. Which is to say every time I’ve gotten the flu shot I spend 15 days in the hospital with pneumonia 2 days after getting the vaccine. Remember COVID has treatment options but many of the side effects of the vaccine don’t.
1508455403981578245	@CyaraBird No one cares about the elderly come on. I've been sharing and letting people know about how they didn't even attempt to save COVID sick elderly in the start of COVID. Policies put in place that told LTC managers not to send anyone with COVID symptoms to the hospital. No one cares
1421682073647992833	@clairlemon Really I had covid never went to hospital stayed home and recovered you are being played 🤦‍♂️80% of deaths had 6 or more co-morbidity’s according to the CDC the vaccines don’t even prevent infection or spread
1382642003108892674	Devastating news ahead of the big 6 pointer against Mainz 😩 we’ll be without our manager, his assistant and Lukebakio as they have all tested positive for COVID. I wish them all a speedy recovery 💪🔵⚪️
1546266371302227968	Idk why I feel so awkward coughing in the hospital or waiting room like if you ganna look at me funny go wait somewhere else. We here for the same reason sir and if I were worse or had covid I don't think I'd be allowed to wait w you😂
1379781427399688199	I'd like to see ghost hunting tech tropes spread into other field.  Imagine a device that tells you if you've tested positive for covid by lighting up and screaming like a broken theremin.
1399158553475272706	@russell50034368 @nadyat1998 @realstewpeters I’m so sorry for your loss. I only know a few people who had Covid, none of which died. I know of 2 people who have died after receiving the jab, and another who was extremely ill and admitted to the hospital. I don’t know wtf they did, but it ain’t looking good for any of us!
1469979531012358144	@EurostarUK hi there. Just wanting to find out some information. I have tested positive for covid, but was due to travel on 16/12 to France, which I can't do now. Can I get a refund on my ticket?
1481025572939702273	@dagenmcdowell Correct me if I’m wrong, but I’m with the understanding that after having Covid you could test positive up to at least 90 days. So what’s with a negative test to go back to work? If my understanding is correct, you would have to stay out for up to 90 days.

1477303147735494661	@irritatedwoman @TheMorningSpew2 It has been a thing for a while. In October I was tested for influenza A and B, and Covid (a separate test). Came back positive for all 3. Doc said they saw it sometimes, but couldn’t explain it.

1530374825440681985	I'm 63 and just tested positive for covid for the 3rd time. I'm still dealing with long haul symptoms from my bout in January, was just starting to come out of the brain fog and I fucking got it again. I'm angry and very worried about what this will do to my body.
1488981695869034499	@JReinerMD Oh, you’ve just nailed my biggest fear with Covid - being alone, scared and sick in the hospital with no visitors. That’s the biggest cruelty of this pandemic - isolation, loneliness and dying alone. It wasn’t supposed to be this way.
1386210281487929344	@dc_dhanbad Respect sirI have a mild symptoms of covid where i have toh check RT PCR test weather i was negative or positive when i visited a government hospital near Baliapur block....they said today no RTPCR test will held here...because of sunday.. please help.

1508552168374157328	@talkRADIO @Iromg Mike Graham's show number of people being prevented from visiting their loved ones in hospital is a scandal.

1530779243533197313	@dysclinic I am still being investigated for endo, but the day I tested positive for covid, I started my period. I bled so much that I was given double dose of high E BC and TXA to stop my bleeding. My HBG dropped so much I now need iron infusions. I believe it is all connected.
1379434715355115524	@tonyposnanski I’m sorry you aren’t feeling well, but glad you got your shot! Have you ever tested positive for COVID? I’m worried about getting my shot too soon after having Covid. It’s interesting to see how different people react to the shot.
1389040813921816579	@maskson247 @Hopeful86848674 @MonicaGandhi9 I was in the hospital for an extended stay in December. The nurses told me over half of that hospitals staff has had covid.

1445112366576771077	So I have a situation:One of my professors got tested positive for COVID AFTER we met and he was experiencing symptoms on the weekend and I had him Wednesday afternoon of last week in person. I’m scared about being on campus more. I’m not experiencing symptoms btw.
1421991195606138880	@georgebrown06 I believe I heard on the news yesterday or the day before 7,000 hospitalized in Florida with covid
1529429944291405825	@elevenelb I am not vaxxed, I don't mask everywhere (I only mask up in the hospital during visits) I shop, dine out, AND I am fighting a winning battle against stage 4 cancer. And beat covid without breaking a sweatOdd how things work out
1387752456097046528	FINALLY - What I have been saying from DAY 1. If not for obesity, we may not have even heard of Covid.CDC study finds about 78% of people hospitalized for Covid were overweight or obese https://t.co/d3CA9PQk1H
1481054581081657352	(Also I am probably fine but I did still test positive for COVID about a week and half ago and while I think the acute illness really is gone, I keep attributing every random discomfort to COVID now)
1433916252163031042	So ya. My kid tested positive for Covid. Everyone is vaccinated and we’ve done everything “right.” It’s incredibly scary…my current biggest fear. They said to “assume we all have it.” If you could send some love my way while I quarantine and hope for the best…🖤
1408093686337093632	Actually just had my first Covid test. It's the first time I'd needed one because the test and trace app lost me know I had come into contact with someone positive. Came back negative, probably because I've had my two jabs, but it was slightly worrying even though I've felt fine.
1373623863058309122	As a veteran of the math wars I’d love to see a follow-up question asking respondents what 20% of people w/Covid ending up in the hospital means(Completely agree that sense of risk is out of whack)
1441109901791485959	My Trump-loving, antivax family now has pneumonia and COVID, thankfully not in the ICU yet.They really are showing us libs who are vaccinated and refused to attend family gatherings because of their attitudes. FFS 🤦‍♂️

1483595044821127168	@ctemtb Christ 🤦‍♀️ My FIL is severely immunocompromised (cancer, diabetes, amputee, etc) and the flu is enough to put him in the hospital basically annually. Meanwhile, his case of covid was manageable for him at home. No one should be going out sick, period, whether it's covid or not.
1516527551182786566	@AirlineFlyer @ssegraves testing i’m still iffy on. I know quite a few vaxx &amp; boosted folks who traveled abroad, got covid, didnt know they had it, tested positive due to the us mandatory test and had to stay there 5 more days.
1395550763846275073	I m a bit confused. While we are discouraging ppl from coming to hospital due to potential of exposure to covid and wanting to decongest - we asking elderly to make a crowd for their vaccination in the hospital?
1372256679379800068	@autigers1970 @thomasmckenzie A woman in a care home near me had covid last year, then had both vaccine doses this winter--&amp; just tested positive. Hopefully it will be a mild case, but she must have contracted it from someone vaccinated, bc that facility is fully vaccinated.
1503555119941627904	i went to the hospital &amp; thought i was about to die made em covid test me n all
1519502023120625665	Well, It worked for me. SO well in fact, I didn't get sick AT ALL. Took as a prophylactic and was 100% knee deep in COVID for a week. Multiple people tested positive for COVID... Including my wife. She used Ivermectin &amp; was better in 3 days. Others didn't &amp; were sick for 3 weeks.
1490426537228730369	Either Covid is a fluke or I’m the fastest mf to bounce back without being vaccinated. 7 days or less and I’m negative now. When I tested positive I answered them questions different 👀

1420110290096697347	@CSomething11 @NaomiYoungstein @Coo_ray People with Covid who are actually admitted to the hospital do so because they’re showing signs of things like bilateral pneumonia and dangerously low levels of blood oxygen. I’m sure some less sick Covid cases are going to ERs, but they aren’t given a bed and are sent home.
1362756180649607170	My wife was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma last year. Her oncologist STRONGLY recommended she get the #COVID19 vaccine when offered the chance, and I concur. The risk of and harm from an immunosuppressed cancer patient getting Covid FAR outweighs any vaccine risk! 👇🏽
1467798758897422339	@tinamasawi Actually much less often with the mask wearing and sanitizing. But I know too many people in different geographical locations in zim who had flu symptoms and they've all tested positive.

1513303127067402241	@tdbhate Count me as one.  Hospitalized two weeks ago and after two years of NOT getting covid, fellow patient's family didn't stay masked their entire visit and gave me a lovely present...covid.

1386641927911641099	@BenQuin62369463 @JuliaHB1 @devisridhar We are talking 30-40 here why do you keep referencing people in their 40s. And can you supply the data backing up your baseless claim that tens of thousands of 30-40 yr olds were admitted to hospital due to Covid? I'll wait.
1521397279307231233	Just for fun I did a Google search for Covid, Cnn, taiwan and got nothing beyond a story from 2021 about last years outbreak (when Taiwan was mostly unvaxxed) and Pelosi cancelling her trip due to a positive test.
1416527752061231105	@patric_reynolds @unscriptedmike Not so! I know several vaccinated people in my city that ended up in ICU with COVID! They were first responders and one of the first to get the vaccine.

1484041470277419008	Extra sick days are actually a big problem. They disincentivize teachers getting back. I’ve an in-law who is a public school teacher who tested positive but is NOT “sick.” If she had to take her own sick days she’d get back ASAP, but since she has 7 “covid” days she figures, WTH!
1528379909571325952	I was supposed to head back home (Montréal) today, but yesterday I tested positive for COVID—train travels forbidden. She’s negative so far, I am masked inside the apartment.Since we have to isolate for a week, she’ll take her space back and I’ll be working from a couch 😅
1466659445505609728	@IMudlet @abcnews No need to lie, lol look at that chart I posted before, chance of death from covid is minuscule. Average age of death globally is 80 - 84, in AU it's 85. If you're 90 in AU and get covid and end up in hospital you have a 60% chance of survival. Numbers don't lie, it's fear porn!

Its still a majority if the elderly that are dying from it even though there vaccinated
1463719010403454979	@VancouverFiveOh @CatKeitlah @adriandix Because right now when you were diagnosed with Covid they are sent home for 14 days to quarantine. Do you know why? Because it has a fucking 98% survival rate and they give you shit to ensure it doesn’t progress instead of giving me the Ivermectin protocol to stop it
1451247859802705922	@Malcy43 @WithBiden1 Ugh, that’s not good, sorry to hear. I am considering going to a concert where vax or neg test req’d., but am worried masks won’t be req’d. I think we need to do it ALL. And yes, I know of at least 9 ppl who have had Covid. One went to ICU and has long Covid along w/ another.

1429037230274727937	#Freedumb I just saw a photo of a three week old baby in hospital battling COVID...makes me sick that these protesters think the lives of others don't matter as long as they can go to restaurants, casinos and footy games while COVID spreads.
1487084010769637377	@kesayers @JasonMiyaresVA I can pretty much guarantee that most of those died of something else, and just happened to test positive for covid. Many probably didn't even have covid. You do know that hospitals have been falsifying covid numbers to reap the financial benefits, right?

1377636833715056644	I starting working as a mailthem! but no longer! I was removed after telling my supervisor a) I was made to operate a vehicle with no working blinkers b) someone tested positive for covid + c) 2 many of the employees don’t wear masks properly or at all. @USPS what’s up with that?

1475362162205859840	I have long Covid and have since the beginning, I was unlucky and diagnosed positive in March 2020 when tests were not available yet in my area. This has caused me to have  issues medically, including not having access to care. PLEASE GET A PCR TEST! Leave a paper trail!!!

1470880531118055427	I have recently been told that the COVID vaccine kills almost everyone that takes it. Causes clots in so many.  Re-writes DNA.My question is: does anyone know anyone that died or hospitalized from the vaccine?  I was more sore from the 2nd one but Typhoid shots do the same.
1481272084848250882	I worked at the department of health for COVID cases and pls let me help you. When you test positive isolation is 10 days after initial first symptoms. DO NOT test again because your residual antibodies can make it seem you are still positive. Antibodies are good, don't trip but
1443690681122254854	I can not believe it. A dear colleague, who didn’t believe in covid, got it was hospitalized for it, released and 6 days later killed himself because he was ashamed. I am in total shock.

1563539268941021185	SAY NO TO SHOTS! To be honest I haven't even been sick since the very first day the pandemic started and had no shots ...  And I have chronic sinusitis diagnosed through an MRI. PLUS I DO DELIVERY GIG JOBS AND GO IN AND OUT OF EVERYWHERE AND ANYWHERE. SEE TONS OF PEOPLE! #COVID

1476321423962648577	@Kevin_Maguire Slight correction my bad. 27% of deaths for any reason within 28 days of a positive covid test are unvaccinated. 48% of ICU covid patients are unvaccinated.
1468993144226254849	@JohannaMellis With that being said, I’m 100% of the disposition that anyone who’s unvaccinated and admitted to the hospital for Covid should be given the vaccine as part of their treatment.
1571956747090132993	Re: #COVID19 I've had the shot &amp; booster. I felt horrid the very first day when I tested positive but all of that has subsided. It's been a cough here. A headache there. Beyond that, it's nothing like I feared it would be. I'm the only one sick, which is great.
1445352920376127494	Everyone I know who’s tested positive for COVID has been vaccinated.
1469211046976098305	@Shivajihimself @KatTrimble By accounts, they're quite reliable at showing if you're infectious. As someone currently with Covid, I tested negative Tuesday morning, had a very faint line for positive Wednesday and a deeper line yesterday. https://t.co/SSyezbISaE

1472606132418007052	How serious are some of us taking COVID? My close contacts are my husband &amp; two kids - and their close contacts are the same. For two years.If we'd test positive, we have only put each other at risk. We would have to call ZERO people to tell them they have been exposed.

1451357365773635617	When covid ends, our council should organise a ticker parade to all health workers and police who are doing it hard. I know the front line covid nurses and staff are suffering in the hospital. So far, our zero case beggars belief. But thank you all esp our @DrJoeMcGirrMP

A cold in April put me out the whole month. My first vaccine shot (moderna) had me stiff and sore the next day and that was basically it.
1614711749634330624	@Mathiso44580013 @healthbyjames Well, I think most doctors would agree, they are not very good doctors. And I tested positive for Covid right after my first series of vaccinations, and I had no symptoms whatsoever. That was Delta. So I was very thankful I had gotten fully Vaxxed.
1513619524855255041	Some data for an oral therapy for hospitalized moderate &amp; severe covid patients was released. Agent reduced mortality by 55%. It’s a cytoskeleton disruptor that blocks microtubule trafficking…I’ve no idea what this is. https://t.co/wXciS6dogS
1374125543499698178	@jake_kesey @UDontNeedMyMail @bdgrdoc @DHSWI It’s possible to die from a cold, but even the flu, I know 0 who have died, 0 who have been hospitalized, and with covid I know over a handful. You can admit covid is worse than the flu without acting like it has a 50% mortality rate. I don’t get why that’s so hard
1397265257932869632	@walidgellad Mask them up and test. Mine was positive despite vaccination, I am still not back to normal 20 days later. Mild covid disease is not mild enough.
1431929355127726081	@FatsPostingLs That's what I hate. 78% of covid patients on the ICU are obese, 40% got diabetes diagnosed (others got probably already undiagnosed diabetes, pre-diabetes and/or high insulin which is unhealthy by itself).

1502932104065261573	@Ya_a_seen_Him Get a covid test.I thought it was the booster till the test came back positive.
1542194639158902784	@gtconway3d Well I was in the hospital being denied life saving surgery because of a covid vaccine and test I was refusing. Yah that's still happening in America!
1374057340387819520	Going to be weird watching this on my 🛋 📺 at home, while I finish up the last 24 hours of my isolation due to positive COVID test last week!@MilesCC_WBB is in great hands with @AshlieLarson. They are very well prepared &amp; more than ready for this situation! Have fun!!!
1426694186259030017	@dvillella @RonFilipkowski Before Covid, a few years ago I was in the ICU and my family could visit
1476563423718559749	I worked with a person who tested positive for COVID all day 2 days ago. And our boss said he was okay and didn't send him home 🙃
1381444845802258435	Today was one hell of a day. I don’t have any words to adequately describe it. We were in the ER from 10am-7:30pm before finally being admitted (into room 666 😏). I had to leave at 9 because of Covid visiting restrictions. She’s alone, in pain, and scared to death. Please pray!
1442625566339842051	@laurast51362949 @McTeagle74 @MissGizzie If I get covid, I will be much safer than relying on personal immunity. Assuming I don't have to be hospitalized. Anyway, I do actually know how it works.
1334462812001800192	@SepsisUK I think we should be offering a test to check immunity in those that have already had it before jumping to give them a vaccine.  Surely if you have had a covid positive test result this is sensible?  How easy is it to do a T cell immunity test?
1377298908100100105	I tried to get a mobile rapid COVID test and these niggas gone say just go to the ER we ain’t coming lmao https://t.co/pOg89DWifL

1419395855715610630	Quick question - my wife tested positive today for COVID today, I will get tested tomorrow. I’ve had my first Phizer jab a few weeks ago - does that mean I automatically test positive because of the vaccination?

That said, #COVID19 cases are up over 100% in 2 weeks and test positive rates are over 10% in my area, so I’m concerned about where we’ll be in 3-6 weeks.
1387484081152094210	Reason no. 1 for why I’m not getting the vaccine:My wife tested positive for COVID over the winter, so we quarantined for two weeks. All the while sleeping in the same bed and having sex. I never tested positive or had any symptoms. Guess I’m just built different
1569086571546087426	@hazard_zach @Dakota_150 I had Covid in Spring 2020. Wound up in ICU. A few lingering things got better post vax. The remainder are what they are. I may well wind up with early onset dementia from it. Only time will tell.
1427496957430226948	@canammissing Devil's Advocate here.According to my understanding, you still get Covid when vaccinated but the vaccine prevents you from falling seriously Ill.So you'll still test positive.At least that is what we're being told.
1596059837011558401	@rachelschraer if i remember correctly people who died within 28 days of a positive covid test were added to the covid death figures - even if they died in a car crash. shame you didn't dig very deep 2.5 years ago,
1372748959244939269	I have a close family member in the ICU with COVID pneumonia. 😭
1385959862148898820	@CryptoSnoopBER @crypto_bitlord7 According to the CDC, 78% of those who were hospitalized were either overweight or obese. In my city only 6% of those who died from covid were under 65 years old, and many people speculate this 6% may have belonged to our large homeless population
1384364960755724295	@hoddydod70 @alexjac877 @LooksToCamera @Jordania213 @DPJHodges Worked all the way though in a busy supermarket no covid, no staff off, mixed, no family in hospital, no deaths wake up n get a life not easy for someone with #fbpe in the name ok I know!!!!
1428387443472883712	@dianaberrent I'm all for monoclonal antibodies, but I believe that the best application would be for Covid patients with severe symptoms - such as problems breathing, as opposed to asymptomatic vaccinated people who happen to test positive.
1449059893986557955	I believe in my natural immunity so much I’ll make everyone a deal:I’ll let 5 people with Covid sneeze on me. If I don’t test positive or show symptoms for the next 14 days, I don’t have to take the vaccine or show a vaccine card anywhere.
1529899253438394368	"@TylerRuinsTV @Adam_Newman Wow, and yet I test positive for Covid, I have symptoms, and all I get from Tyler is a voicemail that says ""Choke on it, you hog."""
1476073953063886848	@MurrayGrubb2 @italgal67 I made him go get tested because he travels a lot for work and if you test positive, you can get a doctors note saying that you had Covid on a certain date and then you don’t have to get tests to travel for the next six months because you will test positive
1408417855150907394	@aDatingDad @domsloft A mum on here knows An entire school thats shut due to the sheer numbers of kids across different year groups who tested positive. I’m sure others have too. The damage our kids thru covid.long covid &amp; there needs to be recompense

1467127157260439556	"In the ER with the GF yesterday.   I asked a nurse ""So you seeing a lot of Covid?""   He took a thoughtful second and said ""Nah; a few come in here, but none of them seem to get admitted"".      I am suspending my credulity for just about everything I hear from the media"
1406667991849259008	also kind of weirdly guilty to have been vaccinated in march because I was only diagnosed with epilepsy in feb, so in my mind it sounds like I was trying to sneak into group 6 even though I’ve had epilepsy for over a decade 🥴 #HighRiskCovid19
1453446960577384461	@ScottAdamsSays Had COVID, recovered, tested positive for antibodies 6 months later. Meanwhile, those I know who visited the hospital received no treatment in the early stages, just told to go home and come back if symptoms got worse. I think poor treatment explains a lot of the serious cases.

1607503987301048320	@JustinTrudeau I just got over Covid-19 a few weeks ago and although I was sick. The vaccines did keep me from seeking medical attention and be hospitalized. My husband, Children and Grandchildren have all had Covid-19 now and we are proof The vaccine works.

1386556291900792832	Rushed to the ER on a Friday I was not allowed to advocate in-person for her care due to COVID restrictions. I got a few phone calls. You see she had lived with me for ten years. I had advocated to get her healthy. Along the way we had many roadblocks &amp; I broke down doors (5/X)
1484691645878575105	@kimmaicutler I tested positive for Covid yesterday morning, and I assume it’s the Omicron variant.
1378043622478782467	I 1000% respect covid restrictions. I was advocating for them the second we knew about the disease. I mean, palaeopathology is my specialty... But when I have to pin a note to my husband chest about why he is in the Er because he is unable to tell them himself... I just?
1460280555514187776	Hey all, my wife has been ill since last week. We did a rapid at home test the other day and she came back positive for COVID. Have an appointment for 2:15 pm today to see about a monoclonal infusion. If you’d keep her in your prayers, I’d be grateful.
1339317704809963520	The first COVID-19 vaccine administered in Southwest Oklahoma went to Laura Thomas, RN, at 3:06 p.m. She’s served on the frontlines in the ICU since the beginning of the pandemic.

1478097883400314881	So excited* to catch Covid in hospital now (lol it's ok with the length of waiting lists I won't be going to hospital)
1467959378800168971	@AlistairHaimes @froopywoopy Oh my! So that’s your angle, well firstly you may want to check the numbers in hospital for jabbed and Unjabbed, also you do realise that only 5% of beds are taken up by Covid patients (obviously not) &amp; on that basis, you need to stop obese people eating, smokers smoking etc etc
1379898357427040258	Damn I tested positive for COVID 19. 😪
1381627066748133382	@BarryCPearson @bashersi @24tog I'm vaccinated and my chances of ending up I'll in hospital were feckin slim in the 1st place. As a Spanish resident over the past year I've travelled through France and Spain twice. Never been affected by covid.
1445951601152335873	I am fully vaccinated, an ER physician and a man of science.  Here is what I am seeing.  As more and more are vaccinated we are seeing more and more vaccinated test + for covid.  I have seen 4 tonight and still have 2/3 shift left.  One went to ICU and probably won't survive.
1488572238496370688	nah i’m pissed cause if you tested positive for covid that’s means stay in your damn room and quarantine. just because your symptoms aren’t that bad doesn’t mean that you’re not contagious.
1549896290024054784	@matoakit @BadCustSvc101 @VoteLabor2022 @psvbluemts At my hospital we test and segregate any positive Covid patients, though not to the extent that we did at the beginning, because the numbers are lower. All staff masks &amp; visitors require a neg test. Not perfect but safer than mixing them in with the general census.

1431924378405572618	@DMification @Jimmae_D @Fourtescu @GBNEWS @thecoastguy But it’s not 5 MIL when they count deaths for ANY reason that just happened to test positive for covid (not to mention false positives) within 28 days or more in some circumstances.

1478075235224244224	I was tested positive with covid 3 days before my flight @Expedia and @JetBlue still charged me a cancelation fee, blaming each other. Shame on you!

1386331832682262530	@lachlan I had a severe case of Covid (2weeks in the hospital). I had a reaction to the Pfizer vaccine similar to yours. Definitely way better than actually getting Covid. Getting vaccinated is a no-brainer. I'll get the booster too if it's decided that we need one.

People need to learn their own personal risk ratio &amp; research the experimental gene therapy injections.
1516796896219701251	I met a lady in town having a garage sale . She was in the hospital and her nurse told her everyone that died there (end of 2021) died with Covid and all were boosted . Not shocked . Media keeps this quiet
1481634896418246656	Someone in my area tested positive for Covid yesterday. This is their solution. Didn’t even send the guy home. El Oh El https://t.co/orvVeqNES3
1376996537134415872	@slowdownandlis1 @jcoots43 @IanVestal @MomusNajmi @harrylitman I have RNs in my life who work in hospitals. 1 in particular in ICU w/ Covid pts. Not everyone can b counted as covid death even when covid related. So death count could be more considering states like FL who have hidden on purpose death counts.
1419230930032603136	@sajidjavid HOW DARE YOU! I spent 3 months in hospital with covid and another 3 months rehab.  After spending a YEAR SELF ISOLATING! I've had both jabs but as I'm high risk and the vaccine isn't 100% i still have to. I'm not cowering. I'm protecting myself on #NHS orders!
1440482847106617346	@B52Malmet @POTUS @WHCOS The monoclonal antibody infusion centers at various facilities are probably not designed for inpatient hospitalized people.  OK, if people wish to get infused at a laboratory confirmed positive covid test result, I won't object.
1488577474065805313	From my facebook memories today. February 1, 2020 is the day when the first person was diagnosed with #covid19 in NYC. We were so clueless back then.  If only we had received proper guidance on how to stay safe.  💔 @SurvivorsChange @covid_loss https://t.co/BCq9bIcijp
1376566254840987652	@munderw341 @ChrisAlbertoLaw @kaitlancollins @ddale8 @MassGov I just worked my butt off again this last weekend in the icu. Covid after Covid. We shouldn’t have to be “full” of covid to get compliance
1455010141032439815	@ABC7Chicago FTR: I will never apologize for not being vaccinated. Vaccinated people can spread it, get sick, get hospitalized, and die. And half of them think it’s their job to shit on people who don’t want it.Covid might get me one day, but I least I won’t turn into a segregationist.
1483429657542381568	They really can't make up their minds about this. I get covid and give it to my family and suddenly the vaccine was never supposed to stop me from getting sick and spreading it, and the shot was just there to stop me going to the hospital.
1479567570420256769	I just suffocated an Antivaxx COVID patient to death with a pillow in the ICU of a busy NYC Hospital because he hadn’t received a fourth triple dose for Omicron. How do you feel?
1400974152509669379	@TheMancRedDevil @NarrinderT @FurlongMick I felt absolutely crap with a fever &amp; a bad cough. Then I had a shock as I was sure I hadn't got COVID, but had a test just in case &amp; was positive. The long term effects were really unpleasant.
1373019386928316418	@DonTravlos @MichaelJosem @TweetbeatIOM Yes surely just a misunderstanding going by recent precedents? I mean if you can put 24 people in hospital and totally get away with it I wonder what heinous things these two have done as a covid breach?
1372690529645850627	@30feethigh @SleeptillnoonB @charlienicole @TrusteeFord No one is tellng you how to think. As far as I am concerned you can go out maskless catch Covid 19 and spend a month in the ICU.  Then when you are about 50 you will have to use a portable oxygen tank just to breath or hug your wife. Enjoy your maskless day. Donate Organs.
1409410003828719617	@MGreenwoodWW I heard that lots of pupils at West Kirby Grammar tested positive for Covid. Do you know how many? Are these numbers counted in Wirral’s statistics? And what action they took to reduce the spread to other pupils + staff? How high are numbers in other schools?
1435700941198708741	@KathyConWom @CMY1952 @calvinrobinson Don’t they tend to stop the worse effects of covid? That’s all I need - not to be seriously ill in hospital - a bad cold like reaction I can deal with!
1597527764185145345	grateful for my boyfriend for taking care of me while im sick and going to the er with me and staying by my side even when we found out i have covid https://t.co/Hwie2EqkCj

1464426141629005829	@GabrielMartinMD @Chacarron314 @fit_feminista @fordnation 4 members of my family that lived in Europe just died of covid recently. They were triple vaccinated with Pfizer.  First doses in April, and 3 rd one in October. Delta variant. All of them between 60 and 70 years old. They were not admitted in hospital because of vax= safe.
1519012243811229696	@Cigleris Hi Peter, her music is not really catalogued properly so I don’t actually have a full list. Because of Covid I could never get to her and once I could she was in hospital… I hope I will still be able to help to get her scores available.
1427978850026369029	@mmaug @kylegriffin1 I know, there really should be a cap on how many beds go to covid at this point. Prioritize people that didn’t choose to put themselves in the hospital
1375927248570753032	i’ve been inactive as fucc because i am dep*es*ed. tonight i made the decision to quit my second team which i was apart of. i lost my job yesterday (again) because of covid and my mums being sent to hospital soon for scans and tests due to ‘cancerous cells’ i’m
1514411062698729476	ok, i've caught up on the ny shooting updates, the police brutality incident, the mental health breakdown, the OTHER mental health breakdown, the positive covid test, anything else y'all wanna throw my way before i settle down with my switch or can i get some peace
1506791576806207493	@BlackKnight10k I believe so. But I keep hearing different stories! Like, he's still in the hospital and may be intubated!! The family is claiming it's an infection, but apparently that's a common excuse that families give one someone is being treated for Covid
1437351868984971267	@DrEricDing I know someone who went to doctor with low backache/suspected UTI ( back in about May 2020) . As a precaution doc ordered a COVID test. Came back as positive. Not hospitalised, no respiratory symptoms -inflamed kidneys and extreme fatigue. Couple of month to feel well again
1386023600428363776	57No underlying health problems 🤣😂In a coma...Has failing kidneys Tested positive for covid....And dying of covid I presume. I smell 💩💩💩💩Jog on loopy loo 🤥No time for these loons.

1462518452829175815	@LMP_mamaof3 @KimChumley2 one in 59 of unvaxxed are admitted to hospital that have had covid. one in 13,000 of vaccinated the same. you're right. your choice. i'll take the shot. everytime.
1384520418468323335	@jin_dionysus our family is one of those, doctors here are the way they'll say you've corona even if u go for eye check up. I am scared shxtless everytime we've to take dadi to hospital for her weakness, most of the times we ask doc to come home. But can't do that for testing ://
1455292097653837827	Hmm hung out with a couple on Thursday. One tested positive for covid on Saturday while the other tested negative. The one started being symptomatic last night/this morning. Probably low risk of transmission? Do I get tested?
1597421089302654976	@AnbilM2 Two of my colleauges recently tested positive for Covid and one of the went on to be sick for a week or two. Its still pretty real, we just don’t talk about it
1336703133414723584	I’ve tested positive for covid and I wouldn’t wish feeling like this on my worst enemy. Please just keep ur distance and take the vaccine. Trust me
1382288043307044865	@spaceninjauk I always say 1 death is tragic but I could never understand how it was right thatI test positive today for covid, I recover, within 28 days of my positive test I get run over &amp; killedMy death certificate says covid as cause of deathSomething very wrong with whole situation
1481961489615527942	@McDonaldsUK @ubereats_uk Always fancy a McDonald’s. But I was supposed to go on holiday today, until I tested positive for covid so certainly need a pick me up #fancyamcdonalds
1430245213151375363	@strickdc @amymaxmen I recall reading that only the unvaccinated are being tested for Covid on admittance to hospital!   Don’t know what to believe anymore, but there’s a lot of data manipulation going on
1426031033594433543	4 weeks around May and June I isolated for being in contact with covid positive persons. Twice kasi after first isolation when I got cleared, the one I have to meet due to work tested positive too. Getting this email is frustrating. But the longing was the worst.💔 https://t.co/1ozzPq6t1L
1470986999838515203	@EthicalSkeptic Doctors aren't any more competent when it comes to hospital treatment. We hear the threats of maybe unvaccinated people shouldn't be given a hospital bed for covid. Good. I don't want one anyway.
1473343423973314571	Spent the past 2 years going into the Hospital for work every day with no issues. Literally my first week working from home I get Covid.... How 😬😬 https://t.co/UzZ88PvDUC
1471866282052046849	someone in my class tested positive for covid https://t.co/C9jSnkZ2nq
1380318411222360065	I tested positive for Covid. But like I feel fine except I can’t smell taste, or smoke
1459398226138656768	@funboyone @RyanRodgersYo Not everyone gets hospitalized or dies because of Covid. They get mild symptoms, I know you want them to die but they won't. But you Neil should be careful cause Darwin will come for you if you go out of your house. Most of these people protesting are vaccinated as well.
1416291322303025153	all these idols being tested/diagnosed with covid makes me wonder if there’s some brujería going around 🤨
1344897356525953025	@SkyNews Last night, a close family member was admitted to hospital with Covid-19. She is young, works in a Care home &amp; had her first vaccine on the 19th. She is terribly ill. I can’t believe it is right to delay having the 2nd vaccine, when the 1st one is clearly not enough protection
1418282647982313476	@awong37 @CFL @sskroughriders Hey remember that time the Habs coach tested positive for COVID in the 3rd round of the playoffs and the entire team had to quarantine so they canceled the whole thing?(Waiting)Neither do I

1423310444681367554	After 510 days of working from home, my office is scheduled to return to on-site work. And, this week we had our first in office Positive Covid Test.......so, yeah., #GETVACCINATED
1510260597815926785	@thekylefree I did antibody test 2 months ago to see why I haven't got COVID despite the fact that I have not been vaccinated and in everyday contact with positive people, I figured that I might have had it earlier. And I wanted to see can I get documents that I recovered so I can live... 1/
1410946220143480837	@MaxB4_ Covid testing is wierd ngl, had Covid symptoms last year but didnt get tested, got a random test 2 months later when I was completely fine and it returned positive
1405028940515889153	@lthomasnews the study's silent on-if Patients reporting in Dec.2020 were vaccinated or not sullying the waters i.e symptoms could be Vaxx-related. Other HUGE problem: its scientifically established- PCR test is known to produce significant false-positive CoVid diagnoses in the first place.
1418178076089880579	"@Culinary_orgasm @KildayMorgan Goddammit! I knew it! I hate these COVID fear mongers so goddamn bad! The vast majority of ""breakthrough"" cases are asymptomatic people getting a positive test through random screening. The vaccine protected them from getting sick from COVID! Just like we want!"
1480159266900164611	I am a Biomedical Scientist and I have been vaccinated and boosted and so has my wife. I *know* it is the single most important thing I can do to protect everyone and avoid being admitted to ICU or dying from COVID. And because it will protect those I care about most. 💙 https://t.co/V3tm19CiD4
1607210537129242626	So it's been a day. Had a lovely dinner with my adult child + their partner. My second kid tested positive for Covid just before coming over, as did his partner.  While we missed them, we all know we dodged a bullet tonight. Keep testing before you gather. #CovidIsNotOver
1482284622864023555	I tested positive for covid this morning can I make jokes about it?
1388118739070111745	@RGigliotti12 @June_Sav1 @GovWhitmer And maybe you need to go to the ICU at your local hospital and see what Covid can do to your body and then tell me which loved one you want to give up for your liberties. Freedom isn’t free remember, there are sacrifices.
1444826770423881730	@jrstrain74 @KarieSkipper @SueurLucille @jacobcabe @logical_steve_ Same as cancer that's pretty disrespectful if you ask me, have you ever had cancer I bet if you did you would t say that. I bet you would t tell a sick kid in the hospital that to them either.  Better be glad you got cancer kid you could have covid you know the virus 99% survive.
1441045411469344770	Day 5 in the hospital for my pops battling Covid/Pneumonia. Waiting for updates via text or phone call is killing me. Send a prayer up for him and my family.🙏🏽
1476148183306846212	The whole COVID debate has got very polarised and I am sure both sides have some valid points. But I would like to know the following:How many in hospital not or part vaxxed?How many deaths involve underlying conditions?How many deaths from Omicron and how many from Delta?
1366484738681298944	@Marmel People who have had Covid are receiving the vaccine!  4 people in my SNF have tested positive twice.
1440171303936270352	@BlackMamba9093 @crystalyeary1 @RealCandaceO I care, although I used EGCG (didn't have quercetin at the time) + Zinc with C&amp;D's.All Fever/Pains/Fatigue gone in ~18 hours from when the Covid-19 “cytokine storm” started ramping up.Tested positive for antibodies 3 weeks later. No vaccine for me as long as they are there.
1427156261120978945	I'm watching this documentary about people who are in the hospital, have COVID and still don't want to get the Vaccine
1429565065338949636	@iTamaraLoves45 Never tested, no vax shot, got covid, had all the symptoms, didn’t go to hospital, didn’t see my dr, gutted it out for 12 days, didn’t think I was gonna die, my immune system took care of the virus…….. done
1431678831627325444	i am very sorry if I am not very active as in this week. I tested positive for COVID-19 yesterday and it's hitting me pretty hard. hope you guys are safe and get vaccinated!! &lt;3
1379172362147495937	who can get me a fake positive covid test 🥺
1429854980240986114	@BrianMarAlli @politicususa Because calling them all names has worked so well thus far. I've seen it on here. The lack of humanity and care for your fellow citizens. 1/4 of our covid cases caught it in hospital, so someone with a broken leg does not get treated if they catch covid in hospital? WTF.
1478534219328536578	Full disclosure. I did announce this eve at our #troyny City Council Mtg, after making it 22 months #Covid_19 free and vaccinated, yesterday after feeling a cold coming on I did test positive and am presently quarantined. Doing great with mild symptoms thankfully! https://t.co/tFk6Z0Pis1
1416827435979460610	@PCJ3dogs @ktumulty @jaketapper @SharonLNYT It’s a good point, with the reduction of infections in general like colds, I might be in favor of continuing social distancing forever but I’ll never get the vaccine. I would have caught covid by now because my girlfriend tested positive but neither  of us got sick
1447330163172257798	@GorhamBrandon @samanthamarika1 I know a guy who survived covid, he was in the hospital for a while, his insurance company has not paid his hospital bill as he was unvaccinated. He has started a go-fund me page to help deal with his medical bills. Covid is changing people's lives for the worst
1434126809638084611	Please pray for me. I tested positive for COVID
1321811687838785537	Danny, please stop trying to give the impression that you have a scientific understanding of covid PCR tests. The flu vaccine will not cause a positive test for the reason I already stated re: genetic code of SARS-CoV-2.
1290672769366142986	@mitchellvii @cindyloufun *Covid Positivity rates does not equal sickness ..*Ppl are symptom free *You can simply have a strain of the corona virus in your    system, from the flu vaccine &amp; test positive...*Death rates down, Negativity rates up, = HERD IMMUNITY*Masks don’t work *C H I N A V I R U S
1458607372818079749	Going down into a sewer tunnel to bring a kid back into the hospital after we'd escaped the person chasing us. I think he had covid and needed care asap. Balcony, reading a story. Almost time to eat.#dream #DreamJournal #DreamDiary
1549595653340565504	Just tested positive for covid so I guess I'll get started on the list of movies I've been meaning to watch from films to be buried with lmao
1532108782251163649	just tested positive for covid ffs 😭 i survived 2 years without getting it cba
1489013060052426753	@RpsAgainstTrump 🙋🏼‍♀️ I hope I’m not jinxing myself by saying this but I’m happy to say I have not tested positive for Covid.
1350179406753505280	@SummersetLass My fear is that because of the fast vaccine roll out it will be used as a reason to say we’ve been successful in our Covid response. In reality it’s like saying well done to the person who beats their partner up but they took them to hospital for treatment afterwards.
1582497845755584513	@j_zimms Second time I had Covid was very different than the first. Legit thought I had a cold but knew it was Covid bc my partner tested positive even though I (initially) was testing negative. People really should just get PCR tests it’s free with insurance and much more accurate
1375147436365209603	@CPFCMOORE @SomePalaceGuy 3000 people in the whole of England in hospital with covid (some could have contracted covid whilst in hospital), ICU’s around the country with hardly any covid patients, yet I’ve got to wait 2 months to sit in a pub and 2 months to possibly go to Selhurst Park.
1385015340917215237	@conspiracyguy78 @HenryMakow Drosten is the one who told Tedros Adhanom to recommend using 45 cycles, instead of 25-30, to ensure a positive Covid test. I read Drosten's paper.
1381123712708190208	@seth_parker @ECMKat1 @FacesOfCOVID The vaccine doesnt cause covid. If she was tested for covid and came back positive, it was covid. I know someone who got the first Moderna and a week later was exposed to a covid positive employee.  She got covid.
1411567420049793024	I feel like I’m the only one that is still very cautious about COVID; avoiding gatherings, wearing masks, keeping my distance but mostly because Im around COVID+ kids in the ER. 🥺😢
1468635333780717580	@UKFootball010 I have had covid (tested positive Christmas Day 2020) it wasn’t too bad. I’ve had 2 jabs
1385407605628039170	My question today is.  If you get the vaccine and 2 or 3 days later get a covid test.  Will you test positive?  Logically I would think yes.  But I am curious if anyone has an answer.
1572634097763115008	@xxtinkerbell Drink plenty of liquids. If you have got Covid it's pretty mild. I had it 2 months ago and I tested positive for a month.
1558986135069671425	I think we all have family NOW going into hospitals w EXTREME CASES OF UNRESPONSIVE PNEUMONIA FROM COVID &amp; its the same family we begged not to get something.  100% of hospitalized people are going in w“rare” anything/everything. Try&amp; explain that away w REAL science &amp; stat risk
1376614672607150083	covid in america will never die bc theres ppl  who will test positive, and yet continue to go to work. its beyond me
1611058216556978177	@5_MeO_MaTT I’m super on the fence about these because I felt 100% okay and took 3 that were all positive for covid but when I made a formal appt to get a CVS test it was negative
1386839518494478338	Current ER situation - Guy on my left thinks he’s in the firehouse, lady on my right still doesn’t know where she is even though I’ve told her she’s in hospital 5 times already and dude to the far right is PISSED that he had to get a Covid test despite being vaccinated 😂
1384182710919303169	@BekyBran @mostsmartest @NC_Governor You are correct but according to The NY Times only 1-5% will be hospitalized b/c of COVID 19 and I’m certainly not going to let that little stat hand my freedoms over to government control. I’ll take my chances you stay home! Roads are crowded anyways. https://t.co/jvvrO9Fd58
1372646882133086213	So... I had to go to the hospital today due to Covid.Five hours later, pumped full of nutrients and oxygen, I was allowed to go home.And just to underline, that's how f*ing pale I was after the ambulance brought me in. Now I'm back in living colour. https://t.co/2oZeyG1EhK
1375150095788834825	Got a text for my vaccination appointment this afternoon, which is rad except for the fact that I also got a positive covid test result this morning, merp.
1398709021683720196	hear nah i genuinely mad now i cant believe somebody lied on my whole family and said we are in the hospital w covid in a severe condition. at a time like this that’s an insensitive LIE to spread oh my god. i not claiming this negative energy.
1449827831245119498	@LaurieLevy19 @SoCalViews @RuthMarcus I had Covid,I survived. Didn’t do to the Dr. didn’t go to hospital, I am fine. I don’t need a “vaccine “ my immune system works just fine.
1456243947504693260	@desertcheyenne @mtgreenee But it isn’t. Every person I know in hospital with Covid is vaccinated or an illegal immigrant. Keep drinking the koolaid fool.
1331581486739431427	I’ve been selected for the next stage of clinical trials of the Covid Vaccine! Off to hospital on Tuesday for evaluation and Covid tests. I replied to the email this morning and got a phone call almost immediately. I really hope I can do it.
1379706311005327360	If I could get some prayers please my husband is in the hospital they don't know what's wrong with him yet it's not covid his covid test was negative. I say thank you in advance for all you prayer warriors
1374817857272418311	@stillgray @thedutchfreddie Give me a freaking break. We now know how many are coming across our border, even without request to show back up for court, like they would, being bussed, even Covid positive where they tested, into our country. I think there’s bigger fish to fry than spring break!
1396538957538594821	@Lochlin88491312 @BusyDrT Well we tested positive for covid. But I hear what you are saying.
1488139546634166273	It really bothers me that my job doesn’t require a NEGATIVE COVID test before somebody comes back to work after testing POSITIVE. I refuse to go around others not knowing if I still have it or not
1346708410260066304	@Jason I have been in hospital in AZ since 1/1 (not for COVID) and overheard staff talking about vaccine. One got first shot weeks ago and getting second next week. One was scheduled for day and the other for Thursday. Vaccination site is across the parking lot from the hospital.
1357465552600588294	CT medical worker hospitalized with septis 7 days after receiving covid vaccine. Days of fever and no appetite DOCS unable to find original infection that caused unusual immune response. Could this be another adverse reaction to the covid vaccine?? I know the CNA personally...
1478217506221342722	@BayAreaGooner88 @KB7_4 @_HenryBolton I don’t care about verification. You can heed no warning you don’t feel you need to. Just don’t blame God when your number is up. I’m a Covid survivor. No vaccine necessary. I’ve seen what it does and I’ve seen what going to the hospital does. You’re just words on a screen.
1426507566075551746	@1776triumph @MSNBC I don't know where you got that information. But every report states that covid patients are filling the beds. Why are people who don't trust the hospitals telling them to get vaccinated going to the hospital to be treated
1476302905359708165	Kinda fucked up I'm more stressed out about my jobs COVID policy for isolating and shit,, with my boss and hr telling me different things instead of worrying more about having tested positive 🥴 I live in society 🙃🙃
1508736685625987072	@pookleblinky That’s what they want us to think and my theory regarding the false/asymptomatic covid cases. Everyone tests positive (the scared vaccinated will test themselves every second day) and then all injuries are a result of Covid. Give me a fucking break!!
1389656860580483072	@RajCMO I am a covid patient &amp; in fever from 8 days. Temp ranges bet 102-103.5.

I have kept taking medicine. &amp; done hrct scan &amp; blood test which mentions corona infection https://t.co/iw6aj1OYGP
1417771031494860800	666 right in the link you supplied. Take your lies and choke on them. I still only know one person that has tested positive for the Corona Virus, and she had the serum for work before she tested positive.
1433289196458835973	@Horseman9112 @JenNWCbus @thespybrief They do. As a nurse and a lactation consultant in the hospital, I have been exposed to Covid and I have not gotten Covid because I was wearing a mask, not N-95. I’m vaccinated and I wear my mask.
1454275118209904644	@icecube got the financial security to be able to turn down 9 million.I do believe (based on data and statistics) taking the vaccine is best for black 🖤 America. Covid is disproportionately killing and and putting us in the hospital.
1382109431068909569	Men are more likely than women to be hospitalized dt covid yet all I see not wearing masks to the gym are men.. y’all ain’t shit
1480093136907079684	Anyone tested #covid positive? I am stuck in quarantine #bored !! https://t.co/uJ2zJYbZU3
1409545076049518593	headache, sore throat, fever, runny nose, sneezing…. if i tested positive for covid 19 i wouldn't be surprised anymore.
1336921897792135169	@realdoll03 It wasn’t a full anaphylaxis, and they’re okay. I’ve had full on anaphylaxis. A 2 epi pen, nebuliser and blue lights to hospital, but the meds worked. I’ll still take the vaccine. Covid is more of a worry for me.
1486581037287280640	did i just,,,, get a positive covid test???
1406770143821172736	"No,  we, are still in a ""Lockdown or restrictions"" I'm not really sure what? We have football matches going  on, we have no masks outside compulsory, we have a varient on the rise, G7 Fewer than one in 200 amber list travellers test positive for Covid https://t.co/NvC0BMtZyp"
1422310256399601668	@POTUS It's awful in Alabama. Hospitals are full with people on beds in the halls. My husband and I finished our shots in March. We are not even allowing his family or anyone in our home. 4 of his family have Covid. One in the hospital. None had shots! Now they want them. Prayers now.
1521908327583825921	@MichelleDewbs A fair question but one that cannot provide a conclusive answer unless medical companies tell us the vaccines don’t work. For reference though, 12 of my family members (vaccinated &amp; unvaccinated) all tested positive for COVID19 over Christmas and all had the same mild symptoms.
1482703874356137986	@AdrianJ54716531 One triple vaxed has tested positive for Covid I read.Shows what a farce it all is.
1421881369437908992	@RonFilipkowski Next week, we will hear she’s in the hospital and saying I wish I took the vaccine. Covid tend to the be listening and finding you at the worst time.
1474083219951824897	@Shane83228624 I know a 30 year old who tested positive for covid 3 weeks ago and is currently yoked up to a ventilator and laying in an induced coma. 🙏

1421188699786723332	I've worked on the covid unit and treated covid patients thru the worst of it last year.... I'm vaccinated and tested positive today (after testing neg yesterday). And don't have any cases in my facility. My symptoms really starting to hit now.  Wear a mask please
1527802713945219072	@hoanghu78661698 Thank you. Got mine weeks ago. Haven’t had COVID, hope I never do, but if I ever test positive I will stay home so I don’t spread it.
1419343472964902913	@DrEricDing Ah. My husband has Covid now &amp; was vaccinated in January. He was not hospitalized but quite ill the past two weeks. He also was given regeneron , which seemed to help his symptoms. We are in Louisiana by the way.
1488419537443864576	@catturd2 But remember boys and girls he won’t die or be hospitalized because of all those jabs. blahbutty blahbutty blah blah. Just like every other person I know who had Covid…regardless of vax status.
1379523004367953920	My auntie has been in the hospital &amp; ICU since mid-December for COVID that turned into pneumonia. We almost lost her. Today she just FaceTimed me with her nurse to tell me her trach can be removed in 3 days &amp; she’s coming home in 3-4 weeks 😭😭😭😭🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
1375874336620490752	@matthew_pullan I think the Covid will have played its part. You can tell he hasn’t trained like before the last fight. Takes time to get lung capacity up to full whack after Covid and that’s mild, he was in hospital.
1561084779600220162	@Proverbs2012 I ask have they ever tested Positive. If yes note date symptoms and severity. I then ask about jabs. Mostly 3 some 2,4, occasional 5. Very few none. Then I ask if positive tests before and or after jabs. Enlightening. Varied answers. The unjabbed had covid minimal or no symptoms
1422218369764364292	@pulte Both myself and my girlfriend have been battling covid; she was hospitalized for 7 days, and I may be hospitalized soon for pneumonia. We have missed so much income over the past 2 weeks, that is just the latest in unexpected struggles that we’ve dealt with this year.
1483771979194904579	my test came back positive for covid… i knew it would but it’s still scary.
1516375343891947521	Actually think I’m going to have s breakdown trying to get organised for going into Hospital! Ninewells Thursday for check up , Victoria on sat for Covid test then ninewells 8am Monday. Yeh I’m working all week too 🙈😩 https://t.co/qPynnzCcxT
1471646607888236549	@ECMcLaughlin My 5th grader’s teacher just tested positive for Covid. Thankfully there’s a mask mandate in our schools, and my kids are fully vaxxed, but I have the same urge to keep them home until Winter Break is over. Maybe beyond that…
1424672133268054020	@AnneLai31821380 Depressing.add to this...4 days in to isolation. Living with an ex ...turned lodger who doesn't believe in the vaccine. He tested positive for covid last week so I have to isolate, lose income ... can't think of anyone I would least like to isolate with. Epitome of selfishness .
1349849194887061507	Today the person with the keys to the kingdom asked me to write a memo to explain that the company has the right to deny your PTO request if you test positive for COVID, and did not get a vaccine. Ummmm......no. Just no. #HRSucks #HR #GTFO https://t.co/nNWrjLWuZr
1381849373064110086	@Parker85 @mabthequeen @HannahThomasy My 29 year old galfriend who wasn’t hospitalized for covid, later had to go back and stay at hospital for blood clots. I know... it’s only one person but pretty crazy that I know someone.

1578430803041980416	If we are truly living with Covid, we would have policies and procedures and systemic changes that would reflect this new reality, that would work with Covid. We don’t. And it's killing us. So let me give an allegorical example: say I was diagnosed with diabetes... 2/7
1559167971376914432	@AlbertBourla I also tested positive for #Covid19. I was also feeling well while experiencing very mild symptoms. I didn’t start a course of Paxlovid and I am thankful I didn’t get vaccinated.

1381496640444370948	Ahhhhhh fuck covid fuck it seriously it's been more than 10 days that they tested positive and the whole injection scarcity thing I am exhausted just wanna go home I miss them
1541218564966948864	Well, guys. It's my turn to bow out for a short while. Tested positive tonight for Covid. Main symptoms are a high fever 100.F , high heart rate and just plain exhaustion. I may pop on occasionally over the next few days. Definitely won't be meeting up with anyone.
1379540369361223685	@YardleyShooting https://t.co/5YwLkyDvIf. Lucky it’s only leg pain.. Lots are dying. I know 3 who died shortly after it and they went down as Covid deaths. Know to women currently in ICU one with meningitis one with mystery injury both lad it..
1379424135307096069	I hate coronavirus can’t even go see my mum in hospital so she’s all alone even though she’s just had major surgery
1550704145992192001	I still haven’t tested positive for or had any noticeable symptoms of covid. Super-dodger?
1474819458636070916	Merry Christmas! I'm spending it alone as I had close contact with my message therapist that tested positive for Covid. Oh well, 8 day symptom free, but who knows, waiting to book a PCR test just make sure I'm negative.
1472288852500836356	i had covid a month ago meanwhile everyone is diagnosed now i really am a trendsetter https://t.co/ITBG0ybAGJ
1481649643138084867	30 or so people in my department, 15 tested positive for COVID a couple days ago. 🤢
1568667619070205952	@AlexBerenson @ClareCraigPath I am not  c🦠vid 💉💉💉💉refused to be coerced. Am in the “high risk”for Covid complications group. Had c🦠vid 6 wks ago. Was not severely ill or hospitalized. I had worse hangovers &amp; flu in my younger years. I am very worried for those who injected. I honestly hope we are wrong
1456721516603838465	@c_19survivor @Dustinpenner25 Again I don't think my wife is lying to me when she is crying because of 30 year olds in the ICU with covid, yes they don't necessarily die but get really sick and long term effects are scary and unkown, also how do you know you don't have an underlying medical condition yourself
1473976170513420292	I keep hearing #longcovid is diagnosed after 12 weeks. Well if you're chronically ill that does not apply! (I'm my opinion of course).  #steroids #Inhaler#tryingtostaypositive
1461462309470187520	@DocCav @BringKiwi @cre8d What collective reality? 2 years of hysteria and nonsense. Everyone i know that had a test tell them they were covid positive literally had a cold/flu. You see sick people daily because that's your job. Not saying people don't get sick.
1376998050326011911	@CNN Really?  Huh.  Then explain how we have blood donations from December 2019 here in the U.S. that tested positive and/or had antibodies for COVID. I'll wait.
1474036630751227907	@Ron89453036 @chrissaccoccia1 You do realize that your using the word “in”. Yes you are correct but at 2 hospitals I know big ones too there are unvaxd people “in” icu “with” covid. can you read properly.  I didn’t use the word “from” which means they are there for other reasons snd they tested. Positive
1350445225853014016	@pfizer @BioNTech_Group Hi There, I just wanted to say thank you. Mum was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer in November and is now very vulnerable. Yesterday she got her COVID vaccine - it was a good day! This is us in the vax Centre in South London.  Thank you all. https://t.co/S3lzLpHPjc
1378436407711174663	Surely this is a couple of days old... like 1st April! Hospitals empty apart from 'covid' patients. NHS waiting lists longer than ever before! Sick people told to stay at home rather than see a doctor or go to hospital! I don't see any heroics in causing suffering and death!
1373367467876122624	It was also just as COVID shutdowns were taking over the country. I didn’t want to go to the ER. The EMTs who came to the house wouldn’t come in.It was my first time in an ambulance. The idea that something had happened to me that warranted an ambulance was mind-blowing to me.
1376052333549879299	@ddlaphotos @DrEricDing I know several U.S. people who have traveled to Mexico for vacation. One ended up dying of covid after coming back, her husband was in the hospital and kid sick - all covid. Blame travelers, not Mexico.
1483848356984201216	Welp… took a test before flying out to Miami for my first fucking B/G scene with Brazzers and I’m fucking positive for Covid. Im just going to curl up and stay in my bed and mourn forever😭 RIP ME AND MY STARDOM. #rightfullydramatic https://t.co/DcotLl5SJ7
1553544481860902912	@POTUS Over 70% of the people hospitalized regarding the coronavirus are fully vaccinated. February 2020 40% of the people that died regarding the coronavirus fully vaccinated I believe that number is much higher
1423285326718504960	Honestly if you get sick and end up in the hospital from covid , I’m not going to feel bad for you.
1382469626513199105	I asked for a prayer Sunday where I was sitting in the ER holding my husbands hand. We are still here.😢 Covid test negative maybe pneumonia. So many test🤒 Not wanting a pity party. I got 0  Think how I feel 😞🕊️🕊️
1371199111932825610	Received my second Pfizer dose mid-January. My partner received his first last Saturday. He woke up Sunday feeling crampy and coughing. We thought it was vaccine reaction but kept getting worse. Wed he tested positive for covid.  Friday I tested positive.
1377962714807595009	My husband has been trying to get a vaccination appointment at a local @Walgreens in Montgomery County, MD for weeks to no avail. Yesterday he tested positive for COVID-19.
1416831613439197186	@CyborgIsBroken @WhileLegal @grimmon2nite @VeronikaSophia @BlackersNot Am not. Vax long-haulers? possible. I was hospitalized a month ago &amp; thought i might have been a Covid “longhauler”. found out DH had had Covid thru antibody test before he was vaxxed. If so, I prob did. Not denying possibility of *some* people having long-term effects.
1376678879306334209	@Kevin_McKernan Anecdotally- seeing several “second covid” with positive PCR and NO symptoms in my NH! Some who’ve been vaccinated during that period too! This madness has got to stop! WHY test if vaccinated and no symptoms?
1606278246152040448	@POTUS President Joe, I have recently gotten my 75th Covid vaccine yet I still tested positive last night!!! What the hell???
1442025668775190533	@wil_da_beast630 Isn’t the most probable situation here that they are both extremely elderly and frail, possibly in hospital with other illnesses (perhaps end stage cancer or dementia related illness) and caught COVID in hospital? That’s been situation for quite a few I know.
1549479211299135489	My work gf tested positive for Covid. They got her wfh…..why is this bitch tryna come back in office 🥴 a negative test isn’t required, just no symptoms. I hate it here
1482037529830375427	Someone tested positive for covid in my household yesterday. Although I don't have any symptoms and I've tested negative, I have to postpone my LA show tonight.The amazing DJ Dan will be taking my place so that's some good news for ya. Hope everyone is staying well. ❤️

1543667273050701824	Me, on the day I tested positive for COVID: “Oh, goody, now I’m totally immune and can go anywhere!” Me, on the day I finally tested negative, after a week in isolation: “That’s it, I’m never leaving the house without a mask again.”
1376532020793331716	@JacqPhrost @DrTomFrieden I didn’t have a fever, had all the same symptoms, and tested positive. You don’t have to have a fever to have covid.
1433817273211437056	@lovablegirl42 @NurseJackie17 I’m wondering if he tested positive for covid or delta. I know someone who was rushed to ER because he couldn’t breath, tested positive, then they found a problem with heart but had to get covid under control first

1577422027106881536	@DrEricDing I read, I listened. Then listened to Scientists from Korea. It made sense. I then made my family 4 layer tight woven cotton masks with added filters, cheaper than N95s. We have been in and out of hospital appointments, A/E,even 2 weeks in hospital and no Covid. Common Sense!
1472383335536242688	@schmendimite @bklyn_momjeans @LeslieGillett @HirokoTabuchi Nah bro, where I live we dont have your covid hysteria BS.  You can test positive for up to 10 days after contact. So 22 months and who cant grasp facts?  NYC has the worse outbreak ever and is one of the most vaxxed places on the planet.  But science...........
1443061354156503041	She tested positive for Covid19 and they are still letting her near other people and perform on DWTS! Am I missing something here! WTF is going on! Just spreading it!CNN: Cheryl Burke shares update on her Covid diagnosis. Remains in competition for now.https://t.co/g9FmmGsgth

1502356991137693697	Just got diagnosed with Anxiety (again), Depression, and ADHD. I got an EKG and my heart stuff is fine so I don't have to go to a cardiologist. The  palpitations ive been having are likely related to when I had covid last year. Gonna be taking different meds and blood tested soon
1388794136686383105	Both (plus now I have the paperwork fibro which I didn't get told orally) diagnosed on Friday last week by my excellent rheumatologist. I'm forever grateful to the locum that ignored the anxiety red flags on my file 3 years ago for the referral. COVID is reason for delay here.
1420503680957227011	@austinford20 @bcurtiswx @BuffaloBills The vaccine is thought to be only 40% effective at protecting against transmission of the new more powerful delta variant. However, so far, those vaccinated have still had milder cases of COVID in general (i.e., not hospitalized).
1528916073155702784	@yen23822105 Thank you. Got mine weeks ago. Haven’t had COVID, hope I never do, but if I ever test positive I will stay home so I don’t spread it.

1488144234339307524	@at1nyswn oh he will be ok !! it’s just a surgery to remove his appendix. it’s extremely common. i’m not sure abt his covid tho…. it must be very severe since he’s getting treated in the hospital. wishing him speedy recovery
1460402295250685954	@DrGRuralMD I know with PCR if you run it to the Max ( 40-50 cycles) it can pick test positive over 6 months after infection is cleared.My mate came back to Australia just after he had Covid. Was cleared with PCR in USA, only to test positive in Aus a few times. No symptoms. I think CT ..

1380276944755949571	@ephelis_lake Very fair. That’s true, it is preventative care. I read somewhere the other day that about 78% of hospitalized covid patients were obese.

1487493480234602499	@AMPD488inLA @kacrn91 When I had Covid in October I refused to go to the hospital. If I was gonna die, I wanted it to be at home and not because the Hospital killed me and with a ginormous medical bill for my family.

1462795062320975874	I can't quite believe what I'm seeing/hearing.

I also had a few feverish symptoms. I am pretty sure it was due to the vaccine as I was diagnosed with COVID on Jan. 5th.
1413841580998410243	@twitchtail @happigroomer57 @Susan74107267 @danielslmd @cdsmith4567 @KevLiberal had Covid and it was nothing. Family members had it and it was nothing. I knew someone who supposedly died from Covid, but he was sick in the hospital before Covid came on the scene. He didn’t die from Covid, he died from cancer...and he died alone because his family wasn’t there
1474460157534953472	Merry Christmas to you all hope you have a fantastic day with your loved ones. Not sure when I'll be back has my writer has tested positive to covid she's doing okay but weak and very sleepy. ❤ https://t.co/mbTQMVIGQE

1479642955384115200	It’s official. I have now heard from more students who have tested positive for COVID this week than I did all of fall quarter.
1439273138680893443	my elementary school music teacher is in the hospital with covid. fully vaccinated but she has ms. please protect people like her by wearing a mask and getting vaccinated.
1329749506615816192	@DeannaCrowCPP @realDonaldTrump 3 out of my family of 4 have had Covid-19. My husband has been hospitalized twice and gets out of breath getting dressed. I’m not telling you to take the vaccine (I am nervous about it too). But the virus is REAL.
1412983668088262658	I tried to avoid warded in hospital during covid since nobody can visit me or accompany me but now it happened🥲
1435940166397476877	@SenRonJohnson I know many people who have either lost a close family member to Covid or been hospitalized because of serious complications from Covid.I don't know of anyone who has died, been hospitalized or really sick from the vaccine.
1380136620611969028	Since the pandemic started, I've seen 2 of my past guests die from COVID (Fred the Godson &amp; Frank Cullotta) &amp; a 3rd in ICU on a ventilator (Reggie Wright Jr).  By now, you probably know someone who died from it.  As COVID rates start to rise again, please consider taking it also.
1440352391795077122	@MrsBrianJaneway He tested positive on Sunday, but the night that he was wearing his mask he wasn't feeling good so I took him to the doctor, and that's when he tested positive for Covid. The pandemic is far from over unfortunately because people don't want to get vaccinated, and it will drag on

1483314692571414531	at home🏠, still getting better from having what ended up being Covid (remember, i got tested on Tuesday, ended up tested positive for it, with results coming Friday night), still got the lingering cough and slightly stuffy nose (but it's been improving as of late)
1551329693516922881	@duty2warn I believe he should be charged with attempted murder of our president by trying to intentionally infect him with Covid during their debate when he knowingly attended and hid his positive test results.
1376649644059602949	@travelbyjohnm @VincentRK Few really advocate for zero covid. I think you are being unnecessarily absolute.My objection, if you read up thread, was to the idea that avoiding disease severe enough to land me in the hospital should be sufficient.  Nothing's perfect, but morbidity counts.
1483918303806607362	@CryptidWorks @polkcohealth You are absolutely correct and I commend you for asking questions that most left leaning people won’t    Without context I have to assume this is propaganda.  Do you know a single healthy child that had been hospitalized with covid in the past 2 years?
1416073224656465921	my family doesn’t fucking take covid seriously. if you were around two people who tested positive, why wouldn’t you get tested? shit don’t make no sense

Maybe for over-80s fatality rate is above 0.1% but data indicates ZERO deaths within 28d of positive covid test for under-18s. If it was 1% then we'd see 1000 deaths per 100k, but in reality its ZERO https://t.co/GF6g6PCY1A

1345786493231575040	@ClareCraigPath @JuliaHB1 Just a question, once you’ve had the vaccine, which presumably contains a small dose of the covid-19 strain, should you then  be tested would you be likely to have a positive result? I know the PCR test sensitivity isn’t brilliant but wondered if it would pick up the vaccine?
1383277728695083015	@robbystarbuck everyone I know who has tested positive for Covid both young and old only to be sent home from DR and NO MEDS to recover. Why is that ? No preventitive or treatment for current covid diagnosis?

1512456423002808334	I tested positive for Covid, like three or four weeks ago. My symptoms — because I’m triple vaxxed I’m assuming — were mild to say the least. Felt like a hangover for a day or two. But man alive I’m so fucking tired all the time now. I’ve got no energy. Ever.

1358802080425680899	@sassycrass I will get more information later today at my COVID-19 briefing &amp; update .

BUT is 100% efficacious in keeping people from dying &amp; admitted to the ICU.
1431710933760593920	If you have a nagging cough, please get it checked. Don’t assume it will pass. If a dr says it’s allergies - see another dr, I’m not kidding. It could save you time in the hospital. If you’re 2x vaxxed still get checked,  other illnesses didn’t stop existing just bc of covid.
1450941132125388803	@kateorson I know more people who have had the gene therapy and caught covid than people who haven’t had the gene therapy and haven’t had covid.

1437339839238746118	Two vaccinated mates from the states have just tested positive for covid. Both my mates are older and very symptomatic. The vaccine is the only thing keeping them alive. Get the bloody shot, FFS.
1474942409914175492	I don't know a single person who has been hospitalized let alone died of COVID
1449008192785113089	"@BorosBruce @PierreKory I remember Dr Marik saying as he often does on FLCCC updates, ""Don't get Covid.  DON'T GET COVID!!"" Then thinking that's a great way to avoid going to the hospital and getting ineffective and unsafe treatment."
1376609221232353282	I think this is the first time I’ve seen a positive Covid test as “non-infectious”
1481264233639989258	So I have covid symptoms and went to get a test, I was so worried I’d infect people there were way too many people in the hospital and the staff themselves didn’t care to social distance from me, one even said “3adi nearly everyone might have symptoms”
1431836560421318656	@Starteller @Rubygirl_Tweets @EileenMarieSar1 I think if you go to the hospital with ivermectin poisoning or unvaccinated with Covid, and they are over 80% full you should be refused admittance, they need those beds for people who have emergencies they could not avoid. There has to start being a consequence for actions.
1617636836784099329	Just tested positive for Covid and will be in quarantine for 5 days please let me know some myteam creators to check out or any show recommendations
1430595447073042433	@mdnij34 My doctor just spent 10 day in the hospital with double pneumonia from COVID he’s fully vaccinated and credits that with being alive. #GetVaccinatedNow
1476311462582919176	As someone who tested positive (I am triple vaxed) and was symptomatic for 2 days. I think we need to re-evaluate how we deal with positive COVID cases much like what the CDC just did in Canada
1606372328300060672	Just got the result of my test and I am Covid positive 😭😷🤒
1374861348706922496	Was supposed to get my first dose of the Covid vaccine today but instead I tested positive for Covid 😣
1552666466390007811	"@sbvegas @trishgreenhalgh The vaccines are ""questionable therapeutics?"" Not sure where you got that info, but my doctor (on staff with Jefferson Hospital in Philly) said all of the COVID-19 patients admitted into the ER have NOT been vaxxed. Also, COVID-19 was the leading COD among LEOs in the last 2 yrs."
1376254723901259777	@DrRanj @mulroneyb @vessybgood Bit like death of any cause within 28 days of a positive PCR test being a 'COVID' statistic I suppose..
1488698248063643651	my covid test was positive :/ i feel super tired today, if anyone wants 2 c@$h app me $ to get soup delivered i would love u forever $ eeriebxby 🤍
1545627111704375297	Did a covid test and I have a very hard to see line on the T does this mean I tested positive or does that just happen? https://t.co/MUmxsNYWop
1478796836446035979	OH NO PARSONS HAS TESTED POSITIVE WITH COVID!! 😳 WE REALLY NEEDED HIM ESPECIALLY SATURDAY BUT ALL IN ALL I WISH HIM NOTHING BUT THE BEST!!💙💙❤️❤️
1551554622279630848	I feel bad for all the people that took the woke poke. So many health issues arising. It's an incubating disease creator... Will be interesting to watch over the next 10yrs. The amount of newly diagnosed cancers after their third jab.. Like it's design that way. #CovidVaccine
1580541256639614977	@RayyvanaTTV Shit, I'm a healthy, physically fit 42 year old and was fully vaccinated when I caught covid. I still ended up in the hospital for 4 days and it took me a while to fully recover. If it could take someone like me out, I fear for other people.
1381937033476734976	So my covid test comes back positive 😳 after all this time of staying careful. I lost of taste and smell on Sunday.....the day after my 1st jab 🤷‍♂️
1438792780004929537	And another PCR test done today due to contact with a positive covid case. The walk in test centre in Loughborough really makes it so easy to do that although I'm not worried I've got covid I feel it would be negligent not to.
1410202990934433800	I'm told it's as many as eleven players who have been forced into self-isolation as a result of being identified as a close contact of one positive test at Salford Red Devils. The RFL's Multiple Case Group will look into that, but lots of unanswered questions re: Covid at the mo
1418298789706616832	@Timcast 10% of people hospitalized for covid have had the shots. I know like to point out the 9 of 10 that haven't but 10% is pretty high

1480764836820647937	Tell me why my work put me on the schedule for tomorrow, knowing I tested positive for Covid like 3 days ago lol.
1475566550862249995	Since being assaulted twice now out side of #coop ifield  drive crawley I’ve tested positive for covid just wondering if the bloke who spitt over me has covid ? Just asking ? Because if he dose have covid  ? he could well  be spreading it all over place when out shopping
1485051648737222659	@YarlanZey @ByViaNegativa @MarianneSansum Or, like with New York state [some countries, or parts of countries did the same], putting young adults diagnosed with COVID [I prefer to say flu/cold/fever] into the elderlies' care homes, resulting in the latter dying due to terrible immune systems.They killed 'em to rig stats
1507273333729116166	@chris_salt I had covid didn't find it like flu and tested positive until the 11th  day wasn't good and left me with a cough But what I have found out with others I know have had it A  few weeks after got what was like the flu really bad had to have penicillin I think it has a connection
1376738305295806469	@Frakis21 @Paul62753492 @AgainNever2 @charliekirk11 I know what it says. I also know the #'s are highly inflated. About 20% of Covid cases people are asymptomatic. Don't know they have it. Let's say an asymptomatic person has a heart attack, goes to the hospital, and dies after 2 days. Cause of death is Covid.
1382792035166351361	@Louis_Tomlinson My corona test is positive😐💀
1479899002825056257	So I tested positive for Covid on the 5th and both LFT’s I did were positive on that day (morning and night). I did my PCR on that day as well (which also came back positive. On Thursday the LFT was negative and each one since has been negative…
1414930496245612544	My supervisor has covid and a few other people in the office tested positive as well. He is fully vaccinated. Keep wearing your masks
1430951630371971084	check out one of the intensivists and RN’s i work with every day in the covid icu. we need to do better peopleRecord number of Kentuckians hospitalized with COVID-19 https://t.co/XifRN04LAj
1541718590411444226	And so it came to pass that I am the only adult working at my school that has never tested positive for Covid.
1383104597015678977	@SRuhle @IvankaTrump You can actually make statements shunning the vaccine efficacy?  So let me ask, you know no one who was very ill or passed away from COVID?  Are you living under a rock or what?   Apparently, only a tour in the ER with a tube down your throat is going to change this perspective.
1455057128230514692	@MikeFitzAU @EVERALDATLARGE No, it's completely ridiculous. I'm in Coffs, have no covid nearby, and have been self-isolating for two weeks  anyway. Have been double-vaxxed. Safest by far, for everyone, would have been for me to drive directly to the hospital without stopping.
1479584727090843648	Covid is no joke like I think I might have to go to the hospital if I don’t get any better in the next little bit. I can barely breathe because I’m immunocompromised. Get vaccinated, social distance, wash your hands and wear a mask.
1537283921821724672	Welp, I just tested positive for COVID-19 for the first time in my life. Took 2 tests to be sure. #COVID19 https://t.co/mFyPCGoBYk
1545436698879959048	i am BEGGING medical professionals to understand that going to the ER is just… NOT an option to some folks. even if we have insurance.ppl have medical trauma! wait times are long! drs are overworked and rarely listen! oh and COVID is still a thing!!
1380459009245917184	@LongSymptoms @KellyRaihani @ClaireHastie1 My GP is supportive and fit note states #LongCovid. I will appeal at my first meeting with support from the union. I had a positive test.
1476164203585196035	@WomaN_OFSt33L It’s a travesty how the government is handling this mess! On all levels Federal, state and local! I swear like 80% of the people I know have Covid rn. None very sick thankfully! I tested positive yesterday i off all week but can go back Monday, last week I’d have to stay home 🤦🏻‍♂️
1602293690780770304	@jeremynewberger @elonmusk Ivermectin from the pharmacy prevented me from getting Covid when my husband had symptoms for two day and tested positive for Covid. That stuff is a miracle.
1371850188483129353	Its funny how they do not want to record deaths within 28 days of a vaccination but are happy to record deaths within 28 days of a positive COVID Test and show you those figures everyday on TV.Note: I support the safety of the vaccine
1514614521347788805	@tomseitz @barrymanilow I guess you missed the part where he said he tested positive for Covid. He probably feels like crap and out of consideration for others, he is not attending the premier.
1474814484057407489	i’ve known more people who tested positive for covid in the last 2 weeks than in the entire pandemic. this is fucking terrifying.
1552815009541095424	well I tested positive for covid that explains a lot stuff👍🏻
1387221010068516867	Don't forget my boo got the first COVID and a new COVID, fully vaccinated. In the ICU now. I'd like to see more people upset about this so we can get shit locked down
1562221600161705984	@GuntherEagleman @Nikki_McCann Same here. Unvaxxed and fit as a fiddle. No trips to the hospital for covid, no blood clots or anything for that matter  And no I don’t need to boost and recharge my immune system like a phone Get the hell out of here with that nonsense public health
1523467996660105216	@CBCOttawa I suppose I should feel bad about that but I don't, they don't seem to care about my family members delayed cancer treatment, so I don't give a shit about their lost posters. btw there are more people in hospital now with covid than during the first waves.
1452695781337673737	tested positive for covidfuck my entire existence
1483857957163085830	@JeannieM28 I will check again. I do have to wait till he feels better. Had him tested for Covid last week. He was really sick. It came back negative but the doctor said he's positive for the common cold.
1355228897743351811	I heard from Dr. Jen on GMA3 that this vaccine is 100% effective to keep people with COVID-19 at home and not going into the ER. Get a better vaccine later.
1476996741987635201	@Bob_Wachter @CAPublicHealth @CDCgov @DrTomasAragon @GavinNewsom When I had COVID, my doctor said I could continue to test positive for 90 days, far beyond when I was no longer contagious. So, testing to get out of quarantine makes sense, but not isolation. I don’t see anyone else talking about this. What am I missing?
1407092010197127169	@peteilc I am not an anti vaxxer. And I know several ppl who were hospitalized w/Covid at the very beginning. We are in NYC which was first hit hard. After that initial two months, anyone who got it got a weak case.
1419371754670202881	He was not FULLY vaccinated when he tested + the first time he tested +. As for the other + tests, he hasn’t caught Covid twice. The dead virus cells stay in your nasal passage for up to 90 days. Trust me; I tested positive twice but had Covid once, thank GOD! #GetVaccinatedNow
1413385682194739201	@AdamWagner1 Hello Adam. Do you know why is there a distinction for those contacted by the App? I thought the whole point of the App was to make it easier to contact you in the event you had been in close proximity to someone who has tested positive with COVID?
1518590776061706242	Welp, my week didn't started that great. Out of the sudden I woke up weak with upset stomach and vomiting. I was perfectly fine yesterday. I hope that is not Covid. I'll use a self test kit. If is positive it would be a bummer but that's OK, I have the 3 Moderna shots. 💉😁
1419548282808946688	I am doubly vaccinated and still I got COVID!Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK’s chief scientific adviser, has announced that 40 per cent of people admitted to hospital with COVID in the UK have had two doses of a coronavirus vaccine. At first glance, th…https://t.co/5dXv03SPgh

1424529601531813889	Alright guys!! Covid test is done and came back negative. Unfortunately, I have to do another test in a few days. I was exposed to someone who tested positive. Be safe!! Protect yourself! By the way, it was a 7 year old who is sick with Covid. Protect your kids! It's scary!
1431409102048071681	@redskeeter @amethystarlight I take every precaution to protect my kids from drowning, too. The article is about children HOSPITALIZED with covid. The increase is shocking. My children  have been hospitalized more than once d/t asthma. I'm not risking them getting covid &amp; needing a vent.
1405603963131465728	@CDCgov Since I am not yet elderly, I don't have risk factors such as asthma or obesity, I am fit, and I am not around the public, my risk of being hospitalized for Covid is nil, I will pass. Btw you might also tell them the vaccine will make them far more susceptible to the next virus..
1532017788507783169	Wife has tested positive for Covid and now I'm getting symptoms. Marvelous.
1446613958086045697	"I'm feeling pretty stressed out between current work BS, ex-work BS, and now I just discovered that I have a fever, which is real bad shit for me right now.. but it's after 5p on Friday, so the only option is to ""see what happens"" or to go to the emergency room (covid town)"
1383072395674673160	@ALGhammer @JcandaceJ I still don’t know a single person who tested positive for covid, let alone got covid.
1479496088130359298	@Covid19Crusher I can't find your graph from your link.But I found this: Non-Vaccinated people are three times more likely to be hospitalized than fully vaccinated with booster.Thanks for your link. It clearly demonstrates that Booster protects people.It is going as well as expected 🤓👍 https://t.co/86R16GhF0K

1429459325693595649	Two people I love were diagnosed with breakthrough COVID yesterday.One is a surgical nurse in Alabama, who was just pulled from regular duties to set up an emergency ICU, as the hospital's regular ICU is full.The other works in service and loses pay every day she can't work.
1461571760105476097	I contracted Covid last year in December. I recovered. A family member I live with tested positive last week. I’ve since tested twice since then, negative each time. I’d call that natural immunity. #Naturalimmunity #antibiotics
1346588558585421825	Just my luck to have the covid vaccine today and my siren swab from Monday come back positive 😬
1450829261011628032	I was ill Friday, been testing for covid untill Monday with negitve results. Last night my taste went really weird. Then Emma said, I bet it's covid. Just got back home from holiday, and re Tested.. positive. Now my taste is all gone. Awaiting PCR TEST. #BUGGER https://t.co/UrxqpmK2HC
1555238742683705345	Great. Mav, Jacob and MIL all tested positive for COVID this morning 😭 I took Mav to emerg last night because it temperature was around 40 and he couldn't keep Tylenol or anything down. They didn't test him, nothing. Did a rapid test today and positive 😭😭
1554923400417742848	You couldn't find someone on the Hill with a bigger heart than Emma.When Micah and my family were in the hospital with COVID, she went above and beyond to check in on them then and in the months after. I'll never forget her kindness and compassion. Praying for her loved ones🤍
1551526553108062209	Well it had to happen some time (that I got a positive test; I'm sure I've had covid before) https://t.co/DTJWThLEiT
1395849481787256833	Wait — I thought Ontario hospitals were at capacity?Also — why aren’t people with covid19 given therapeutics, like ivermectin or HCQ, to avoid having to go to ICU?“Manitoba sends to more covid19 patients to Ontario as ICU admissions surge”@fordnation https://t.co/CEoyJNYbIU
1396067391633825792	I voted no positive covid tests due to helander having a positive covid test during the season
1387045030016163841	@MouthyStaffer @kristadb1 That makes sense. I had full-blown pneumonia (diagnosed at the docs, and treated) in late October/ early November of 2019, and I felt exactly like people with COVID described feeling half a year later.
1376956626847031300	@AmosHermens @harwood_steve @BorisJohnson @MattHancock @FA @UEFAcom couple of their players tested positive for covid apparently although i think one supposedly has enough antibodies or some such thing
1410918361769287684	Hello guys, i'm tested positive for covid today. So gonna take a while to rest and isolate myselfKindly sorry for late replies, hope you guys doing well and stay safe ✨
1562907926620413955	@TheLawyerCraig I appreciate this question as wellChildren who are hospitalized are generally there for serious reasons. COVID makes their condition even worseSome of the children who died “with COVID” wouldn’t have died Without COVID. I am heartbroken for these &amp; all families who lost kids
1488913498281287682	So turns out I do have covid. Oddly both me and my partner tested negative when our symptoms where at their worst but positive as the symptoms subsided. Anyone know if there's a reason for that? I get to loose out on a whole weeks pay aswell, so this is just fantastic 😐
1489663837297119234	@MRSM1TH888 @jarvjarv @bbcquestiontime @robin_shattock I’m guessing you believe the 170k covid death rate too, which in reality is ‘any death within 28 days of positive test’ ! So to be fair we should count any death within 28 days of the vax as a vax death, it’s only fair !! .. it’s their data collection method, they implemented it!
1437273366893711370	@RealMattCouch So, lets get this straight.If you died of a heart attack with a positive covid test (could be a cold. Pnuemonia, flu, rsv, allergies), you died from covid.But,If you die after the vax with a heart attack, you died of a heart attack not the vax.Did I get it right?
1404525131763011591	@DavidSc96749867 @GovNedLamont Moderna &amp; Pfizer vaccines are only 90-95% effective. J&amp;J abt 75%. That means 5-10% of Moderna and Pfizer recepients and about 25% of J&amp;J will get COVID. those percentages are consistent with numbers I've read abt breakthrough infections. Of those almost none died or hospitalized
1516875156635152384	Today is the first day I have felt normal. 28 days after a positive Covid test. Fully vaccinated, I dread to think what I would have been without it.

1380147701883490307	@nickmartin My husband is a doctor dealing with covid patients. Sometimes if tests are negative and symptoms fit covid with no other explanation, he gets them retested. Sometimes patients don’t come back positive until 3rd test. Just something to keep in mind.
1425646047079014404	@cleartheway59 How many this week? Oh.. you don't know because... they don't tell you yet. Next week you will know. But I'm going to guess at least 3. There are 200 kids a day going into hospital now. Even if they make it, a good proportion will get long covid.
1422434837890220032	Has anything in human history had more misinformation spread about it than covid.Covid is a serious thing, my wife was in hospital with it,  but we hear must mask, then makes don't workTake political views out, deal with solutions.  Stop recording every death as covid related
1478358018525966338	@BED_YouTube @ReutersFacts I saw a idiot post pictures where he tested 3 different energy drinks. 3 different brands. What a moron. One of the tests came back positive and he thought he discovered that the COVID test results were invalid. Too funny.
1437874333985169413	Our beautiful cat MJ has just been killed in a hit and run. So unfair. Gonna miss tickling that tummy. Oh, and my second eldest just tested positive for Covid about 15 minutes before. What a week. https://t.co/VHhFZtZBg2
1371808785191350274	If they can link any death to COVID, because the deceased had or tested positive for it within 30 days, then we can link any death to the vaccine if the deceased was administered it within 30 days. Am I doing this correctly?

New Jersey health department said we have great immunity at this point there's probably no need to get a vaccine. Shitheads will deny that, but they called us because  of the positive test and they did a follow up.
1429004617749188613	It makes me so angry the totally disregard for fellow Australians. Don’t take up a bed in hospital if you get sick. All because you didn’t believe in covid and wouldn’t wear a mask and stay in lockdown.
1490324266990112772	Almost all the people i like from my class have been tested positive for Corona and i havent, the next days are gonna be shit, i just wanna get it so im over it😭
1518057363584000002	@Bronson00471184 @covid_parent @WikiDocJames This is why I refused to go to the hospital when I got Covid. I would rather take my chances at home than risk my life using some demented doctor.
1422780374908801024	I worked at the hospital during covid last year, even provided care for patients with covid in the ICU. Not once did I contract covid, but as soon as outside was open and I went out I got it 😕
1478386626732728330	Well. Shit. I’m in line to get tested for covid. I was hoping this was some sort of stomach bug. But it’s went on for too long.If it’s positive, it’ll be my second time having it…&amp; I’ve been vaccinated.
1479704047019982851	Had a great practice run at ‘do i have Covid?’ today. A positive rapid test, then a negative rapid test, then a 12 hour wait, then a negative pcr test. Tons of fun. Let’s do it again tomorrow. #GetVaccinatedPlease
1547724326551842816	@run2ajob no😭😭😭 i was really busy when i got to korea bc i had to go retake my pcr test and then i tested positive so they sent me to a covid hotel and it was just a bunch of fuss to get there so god knows where that thing is😭😭😭
1478480433054720013	Teachers who test positive for Covid must isolate 5 days and then go back to work with a mask on.. back to a classroom of kids that don’t have to mask up.. have I missed the memo on how Covid and omicron is no longer contagious?
1475247450218635269	Xmas 🎁. @boatright_jana &amp; I both vaxxed &amp; boosted. Known 2nd exposure to a COVID positive person. Jana is sick &amp; I feel like crude. We both tested yesterday &amp; are negative. Could have been positive but vaxxed &amp; boosted kept the odds in our favor. #science #GetBoosted
1505961677988134914	@nicolas_gaboury @perl_greyhound @MdBreathe That's really funny because when I went to the hospital the 2nd time for a different condition that  covid triggered. There were 2 people that came in for covid symptoms who said they had been vaccinated.
1471889395355684874	@BennyMacBlog I don’t see why players have to miss any time after a positive test.  If you don’t complete a football move while you have COVID then you never really caught it in the first place.
1374473520168673284	Thank you to the  ICU staff at @AneurinBevanUHB the grange hospital for saving my life and all the wonderful staff on C4 xx #covid ##COVIDー19 #NHS

1486976942817480709	@Sloths7777 Yes.I work where about a 1/3 of workforce worships Trump, are anti vax, anti mask, believe the pandemic is a hoax.They all caught Covid and caused a few vaxed to test positive.Management FINALLY is getting serious.If found without a mask, you'll be sent home w/o pay.#WearIt
1374122602315317254	@LAminerals @kayleighmcenany Oh, PUHLEAZE!  You are NOT a medical expert to be casting judgment on anybody.  What a wretched response minerals. You know NOTHING about how this person contracted covid. I know someone in the hospital now with covid who had not been out of his house since last March.
1380824916673630216	"@Dren491 @Fletch58238937 @CNBCJulianna This is what bothered me. ""COVID deaths"" where someone has died within 28 days of a positive test?

1507049449058668551	I think I'm on the mend now...ish. Covid hit me while I'm being examined for other things. I have an appointment coming up to go  to the hospital and stay there overnight for some tests. Not sure when yet.I might resume work this week, in the meantime. We'll see...
1546109506119237633	A fortnight since I started feeling unwell. Minus last weekend when all symptoms disappeared. Three days since testing positive for CovidFingers crossed Tuesday 5 days in I will see a negative on my next test

1476207256068935681	Who is in hospital with Covid and who is in hospital because of Covid. These figures need publishing. I have heard that a lot cases “in the hospital” are picked up at point of entry testing. #COVID19 #NHS
1425235755505537028	@KatharineSmart Thank you!  My young teen nephew spent 6 days in the hospital and is following up with a cardiologist months later now.  Thanks covid! So sick of people acting like some kids getting killed or damaged is ok as long as it isn't them.
1459245112811159553	@dianaberrent @Survivor_Corps Hair is growing back, but my health was already off before COVID. I'm thankful we never needed to be hospitalized and that we're fully vaccinated.
1455184196645933071	@MollyJongFast I just tested positive yesterday for COVID. I’ve been so so careful this entire pandemic. After unemployment ended I had to get a job. I worked THREE days, @MollyJongFast, and I got COVID. I am so tired of these anti-vaxxers, mask deniers, conspiracy wackos. I’m worse today.
1544746108118880257	“hmmmm I have a runny nose and I’m feeling a bit fatigued, but maybe it’s the huge breakfast I had” -thoughts of a person about to test positive for Covid in the year 2022

She does my mammo's, sweet as can B. Said shes been home for 3 wks but still weak as a kitten &amp; on O2, could barely breathe even now.
1383576105903296516	@arduatendit @sarahsuss I knew several that had covid (including an obese diabetic person in their late 60s and someone with severe asthma). All recovered quickly without issue. I know two (so far) healthy people that have been hospitalized after the jab.
1470156691270471682	Tested positive for Covid. Im pissed.
1376111823884328961	Last year @salvationarmyuk minister Major Karl Gray spent eight weeks in hospital with coronavirus.‘I didn’t know if Karl was going to live or die,’ says his wife, Major Ruth Gray.Read their story on p8-11: https://t.co/pOTIwYAT7t https://t.co/imYToEchGx
1388142950773833739	@RefriedBrean We spoke with some expats from the UK in Siem Reap. They said if you get sick, you don't go to the hospital. You go to the airport, and get on a plane to Bangkok. If they can't treat you there you can at least get on another plane. I can't imagine what Covid will do there
1420409597345636359	So I just tested positive for covid, I was better off not knowing I have it.
1476624270201704449	New Years resolution: Be like my most recent covid test, positive.

Told since going home on 'rest' it not needed, I could test at home. Told em had no home test access. Still no. Emory in Ga.
1377944811043483649	It’s my birthday and I’m enjoying being thoroughly spoilt by my boys ❤️❤️ It also marks a year since I woke up in hospital following my mastectomy on my own (due to covid) but that also means a year to the day since the nasty cancer was cut out of my body! Feeling very grateful https://t.co/IgN47AADiI
1374607970349182977	Today, the husband of my officemate in the carpool tested positive for COVID 19 too (her husband is working outside too) She kept apologizing to us.Gosh. This disease is making people apologize for being sick and it sucks.
1340085696946647040	I reread the Astra Zeneca Oxford #COVID19 vaccine paper several times today. Ten days after the first vaccination, nobody who received the active vaccine was admitted to hospital with COVID-19. https://t.co/Z1Ug8im0Yv https://t.co/nXoSbu6sXR
1612303723572924418	@CovidDataReport With home testing I have lost count of the number of people that tested positive for covid but didn't even tell their doctors unless they were so truly sick they felt they needed treatment.
1421200109178662921	@jgkight61 @PitepaltTweet @lyn_kemper @GeraldoRivera I tested positive for Covid according to CVS.  The symptoms sucked, but nothing worse than a flu.  Actually, better than the flu.  I had no fever or body aches.   Just bad fatigue and dry cough.

1507732058961059850	@mrshaneroberts @ClimateWarrior7 Well I got long Covid as soon as I took my mask off and had to be hospitalized. I’m suing those Zionists for attempted murder.
1479287369844936704	Well 2022 is starting off really great, I tested positive today for covid. Looks like I’m gonna be watching YouTube videos of gameplays in my room till I’m better. Please wear masks people. Better to be safe than not. ❤️
1383097265565356040	"@mcbumfarts Yeah my job had their ""outbreak"" back in November when I tested positive and like 4 other people on my shift did as well.  I think at one point we had 13 people out with Covid, and we only have like 60 employees.  No one was hospitalized though, so that's good."
1379314707694227456	@drdrew So I ask this again as many others wonder - if Covid is a respiratory illness how come everyone Iv knows who’s got sick and tested positive with Covid only had flu like symptoms
1506628090084085762	@askryanair This is very inconvenient sorry to say! I just tested positive for covid. We fly out tomorrow and have no luck at all navigating through the website, or speaking with customer services! Whilst I see NO refund is possible, a courtesy voucher or reschedule of flight would be ideal
1487601576416096259	@SNOWFXINC @albertsjoberg @Dom_Perrottet @ashbarty I thought they were now ‘covid associated deaths’. You know, like how if you have a bicycle accident and are taking to emergency, die from your accident BUT test positive to covid, you count as a covid death. Gee, I bet all our stats are so reliable…
1561788353724485634	@RawDogg209 My little 11 month old baby girl was tested covid positive two days ago my mate … @RawDogg209  😏😔 I wish to U and your fam the best! I hope She will be better soon!
1377260621138366481	I now personally know more people that have had bad vaccine reactions (brain swelling amongst other symptoms) than I do people who had a positive Covid test
1469313875338219526	@RantyAmyCurtis I get like I had food poisoning for 2 days, developed a cough at 4 days, lost smell and taste 5 days in.  Tested positive for Covid.  It sounds like you are following closely to my track in timing.  Get better soon.
1435461031300517890	@Xcell84 @thomaspainenz I know unfortunately. Pfizer is 6 to 8 mths cover. If they are speaking the truth, every variant is weaker so they say. Vaccination only stops you being in ICU and lessens damage to lungs etc. Question is, what will end Covid?
1459621353859043331	@smotus @KevinMKruse I've seen quite a few videos of hospitalized COVID sufferers saying quite clearly that they regret not getting the vaccine!
1482878957544685569	@Hoopster55 @lauramoates @donnadlu False. Antigen immunoassay tests aren't like that. Wait at least 15 minutes. The result is stable for quite a while. If there is no covid in the sample, nothing will bind to the test line. A faint line may become a little darker but a faint line is a positive, as my test kit says
1290426489494802437	@RuFiOooooh @DanMarriesKOLD @ajc You clearly don't understand the difference at all. Let me tell you as a MD when ppl test positive for the flu we advise they stay home &amp; away from others &amp; warn their contacts. #COVID19 is deadlier has no vaccine &amp; limited tx potions. Schools provide sustained contact as well
1441201647238070272	What concerns me is I know multiple people that took until day 7 or longer before getting a positive test. They tested 2-3 times after not feeling well and received negative results. This allows for false confidence and much transmission. #COVID19
1554829976972578818	When I tested positive for COVID Mary went to our doctor’s office &amp; got a ‘care package’ of supplements, other goodies &amp; a medication called Paxlovid.  I’m sure it helps but I take 3 tablets in the AM &amp; 3 more at nite.  Taste horrible!😝
1466065530394234883	@vandersykes @art38741656 @OccupyDemocrats And by the way i have been fully vaccinated for 6 months. And i am completely fine. The vaccine prevents SERIOUS ILLNESS from COVID. Meaning yes you can still get it but you will NOT end up in the hospital.
1544742751031291904	On Saturday, I attributed a cough to the fact I smoked a pack of cigarettes in Vegas and my body getting over that. But then I started to sneeze. I took another COVID test and that one came back positive. 2/?
1442425347845337089	@GMB My mum tested positive for covid this morning, I’m working on the wards at my hospital and I’m testing daily. I’m fed up to the back teeth with it and all the covid deniers.
1387237232562425858	I know someone who spent two days in the hospital because of COVID related symptoms and he literally was resting there to get his oxygen back up and the bill costed $70,000. He's middle class and has to fit the bill. How insane is this?! Smh. We need better coverage @POTUS
1557762301293481984	Tested negative three days in a row post-Paxlovid and then this morning I had two rapids light up the positive bar faster than the control one. It did not need the 15mins 😭 So I’ve got COVID.. again. Maybe never left? ugh
1519240867311149057	@forpetersake Yup.I've got a mild flue. I am also positive it's covid19 and I'll be over it in a week or so.I refuse to get tested to confirm it so Gov can use the test results &amp; stats for fear mongering and creating dictator like illogical laws.
1372131730698690565	@BBCRadio4 @IainKirtley @BBCSounds I was in hospital a few weeks ago with Covid Pneumonia and at to have anti clotting injections every day. I think the clotting is more risky with Covid than the vaccine. I've booked my Jab.. Don't want to fight Covid for a while!
1381023434654638080	And you @TomiLahren  are a REAL IDIOT . At 16 and vaccinated I might not die or go to the hospital with COVID19 but I can STILL give it to someone who’s not.  Your not even smarter then a 5th grader.
1451743735985889282	@anish_koka Spent 6.5 wks in hospital with Covid &amp; MRSA. The loneliness put me in a very dark place. 1 visitor/day. If they stayed 5 min, still not allowed another &amp;  hours ended at 5pm. Depression hinders recovery.
1385164196854312960	Went to hospital for a covid test. Nurse pokes me so hard up the nose with the swab, I am CERTAIN I have brain damage as I sneeze continuously for 5 minutes and a pool of tears forms on my collar and the floor. I hope they do a good ass wipe down of that room...

1516458327122849794	I've been through the entire pandemic without getting COVID. I've been super careful about everything I do. I'm also vaccinated. Today, I tested positive for COVID 😭 FML.
1430702240432525317	Today my 11 month old patient tested positive for Covid. She’s sick. Many other babies at the same daycare are also sick with covid. Get the vaccine, protect your babies and your family. Do it for them.
1435617780636823558	So let’s get this straight, you want me, to go into the ER and HOPE TO GOD that same dr is on duty ??? I call and I get nothing, can’t go in and see my own dr, and I feel like shit. So I just went and got a covid test to be on the safe side.
1400082802155167744	@DrTomFrieden Are there stats available somewhere on the vaccination status of currently hospitalized COVID patients? I think such stats could send a very powerful public health message.
1514383819163459588	So just got tested positive for COVID without any symptoms … force to cancel vacation plan over the long weekend and isolate at home … well at least my boss told me to WFH next week instead of using any of my vacation days. 😭
1381667034031923206	people are really inconsiderate ... like how can you know you have been tested positive for covid &amp; still go out to gatherings ... make it make sense to me , and then have the nerve to not have on a mask .💔
1421414088127692806	@GBNEWS I’d rather be classed as selfish than in hospital after a reaction to the jab that I’ve a higher chance of than suffering ill health with Covid!!! I’ll choose selfish thanks!!
1430452955715670016	@SebJam12 @unojen_wood Did they die “of” Covid or “with”it? There’s a definite distinction between the two. Eg patient has a stroke, taken to hospital, tested and gives a positive test, dies of huge stroke. Covid related? I think not.
1389281910883594242	I worried for the last year+ about getting COVID because I’m immune-compromised. On my way to my second shot, I almost got side swiped on the highway by a dude in a Maserati staring at his phone. The week after that I was hospitalized for 2 days for a non-COVID related infection.
1476372521112977409	@longlu92 @gooseeggs3131 @SpookyJay36 I had symptomatic covid, I did not go to the hospital &amp; did not get the vax nor do I plan to, I have natural immunity. We have 4% of world population but the majority of world cv19 deaths. You're being scammed. The protocol doesnt work as evidenced by all the excessive deaths.

1501603149253169156	Please pray for my nephew, Jude. He’s four months old and is in the hospital. Not COVID, but he was put back on oxygen this morning. Poor, sweet baby is struggling to breathe, heart rate is elevated and he has a fever. Could use all the prayers and good vibes we can get.
1354977771022331911	I’m watching this COVID special on BET with Tyler Perry and I am so confused. The epidemiologist just said the vaccine doesn’t stop you from getting COVID but it stops you from getting really sick and going into the ICU ... ?
1389136551209283585	I need to go to the hospital 😭😭 but I don’t want them giving me a COVID test
1468273891881717764	@Roary4Life It was my shot #1 that had me in bed for 1 1/2 days.  I also had COVID back in Jan. that put me in the hospital for 5 days.  I'd take being down for the count any day over having COVID.
1413727011101548547	So I have been vaccinated, took care of Vivek and Rudra that are covid positive for 2 full weeks. Yesterday, I took the PCR test again and I’m still negative. Vaccine works folks, take it and don’t be picky!
1473436840040579073	I have avoided covid for 2 WHOLE YEARS, and then test positive 3 days before Christmas. Srsly???😭
1579298739961102336	I can get that people are over Covid, I really can.. but I wish people let others know when they've tested positive. It's really a matter of human decency more than anything!
1607414604900229120	Before vax I caught COVID, O2 went to 85%, I went to ER cost me $2000 out of pocket.  I'm vaxxed &amp; boosted no COVID infection since.  Can you imagine how many would have died without them?
1420373246193532931	@abandonedameric Kinda, yeah. My ability to track &amp; remember tasks at work seems to have gone downhill. I never had covid. Tested a lot, never positive.
1476646581491441668	I don't know how to feel about waking up early a bit after 2 days of being on bed sick, waiting a long ass line for like 3 hours today outside in the cold even of I was there at 6 AM, waiting to have a quick covid test to get back to work and then have positive results.(1/3)
1421076079607959555	Lol not funny but I’ve noticed when ppl test positive for covid they’ll mention how they know x amount of ppl who are vaccinated and also tested positive like …… https://t.co/9mbFJuE34R
1475292952281104385	almost no one follows me but i feel like i should still share that i rapid tested the first day i had covid symptoms and it came back negative but my PCR test was positive two days later. please please PLEASE do not rely on the rapid tests if something feels off
1472948923031506955	@RyanGirdusky @jimcramer @ColumbiaBugle Triple vaccinated Jim Cramer was saying the military should run a forced vaccination campaign in America a week ago. Now he has officially tested positive for COVID. I bet he still thinks mandates make sense too. Fully dug in on tyranny.
1386008381811482626	@elirogan @ThisLooksNew1 @1BJDJ Yes I can still get covid and I’ve had my first shot but the risk of me ending up in hospital on a ventilator and dying is reduced the likelihood of me being run over by a bus is tiny but that don’t mean it can’t happen does it ⁉️

1541925968687890434	@JeremyVineOn5 @theJeremyVine @StormHuntley That gene therapy you had did eff all to stop Covid lol. I had it bad and had a stint in hospital due to my heart failure. Then I got Omicron after Xmas and it was nothing as my immune system was stronger. No vaccines for me thank you.
1431004599431966725	Tested positive foe Covid, 100% my fault for not getting the vaccine earlier but still. Hopefully I should be fine tho so yeah. Still annoying asf lol
1468710079314681862	i have heard of 17 people that i know today that have tested positive for covid today in my small ass town please wear masks all the time covid is real and masks do help
1513978442303291401	@TaylorLorenz Went to PT this morning, which is located inside a gym in a downtown office building. A woman started talking (maskless, coughing) about how she was recently hospitalized with COVID. How am I supposed to go back to the office?
1475247347449872384	@Laiebchbum I would tell him 800K dead in USA is an major underestimate. Many were never test or diagnosed before dying from Covid.
1471245227398766599	I don't tweet about work very often, but... for goodness sake if you test positive for covid, fill out the online self-tracing form. This frees up contact tracer time, allows calls to be prioritised and helps protect the most vulnerable.
1410218942589718536	@JClarkson1311 @LongyWTID The players will still serve their bans over course of the next games that can go ahead as  I understand it. Also you can't make up Covid outbreak to suit your needs. I'm expecting that this needs to be evidenced.....y'know with positive test results......
1480634008895688706	So this is Boston. On a 7 day average, they had 80 people in ICU with Covid, out of 443 staffed ICU beds.  If I told you Boston, a city of roughly 500,000 people had 80 people in the ICU with Covid, how scared would u be? Most people probably think its like 800.
1453785597085106176	2/ I only ever looked at the ISDH's dashboard. I knew from press conferences by ISDH that anyone who tested positive for COVID, died, and had COVID listed as a contributing cause on the death certificate was counted as a COVID death.
1517260066755338240	Yep! I tested positive for Covid, but basically I’m feeling fine- grateful to be vaxxed and boosted. Thank you for the well wishes. This just proves that I will do anything to avoid interviewing Jason Bateman.
1490039036291002374	@AustinMcIntyr15 @ShannonSharpe I guess it's to stop u being admitted to the hospital? SO u still catch covid, but it won't be as serious.
1552746689919737856	@dougnabbit1 @SatNightSoup Oh thank you Doug. You have such a kind soul!I hope I am not positive for it. I feel like I have it already, but it is likely psychosomatic as it is only 12 hours. I will post covid test updates. 🫶 https://t.co/6FsxjR8s1d
1430264932730392576	@melissamiller33 I understood it to b if ir diagnosed  with covid the ins company  get 16500.00 per person and covid death 21500 per person...
1511878753206804480	@noplaceforsheep I have seen a number of people through my COVID infusion clinic getting treatment for COVID who had vaccination within a week or so prior to catching COVID. Didn’t think they had COVID because of vax and possible side effect. Eventually tested and positive.
1524412254355136512	@hsom113 @DrHoenderkamp Well given someone came in our office the other week and informed us that they had tested positive for COVID the day before, still out and about doing their shopping and everything, I don't really have much faith in some people tbh.
1385122410530230272	@BigTucsonDad On the day of my scheduled second shot of Phizer, I got a positive COVID test. Had to cancel the shot until two weeks. So close to the finish line.
1482514816761839618	@shadeofjoe This must be why I haven’t tested positive for covid yet
1380053240377643009	The lack of genuine open debate around #covid strategy is a moral &amp; ethical outrage -real scientists should be appalled. I just listened to Scotland’s most snr advisor saying the “1 in 4” risk of a clot if in ICU justifies under 30s getting vaccinated..Objective?@carlheneghan
1488276169321422849	"Nothing shouts ""I'm distancing myself from this shit show right now"" louder than an amazingly convenient positive covid test mere moments after you've just been in a Tory backbench meeting following a pants down roasting of the PM only an hour beforehand.Utterly transparent."
1428151170229424133	@doclawble @GovInslee I'm seeing it from personal experience. I know 3 people who were fully vaccinated and all contracted covid. 2 are in the ICU right now. It is not the delta or any other variant, it's covid 19
1428190010885484545	Let me ask. Why test yourself for #covid? Just to see if you have it? There's no meds to take. The vaccine doesn't work. The magnification on the PCR is set high to get positive results. If you feel unwell you should be staying away anyway. So it's pretty much to say you have it.
1386432443268411394	@TammyMatheney Covid ain’t no joke, I currently have it. I was hospitalized for my oxygen being low. But praise the lord I’m feeling great now.
1388128800190484486	@AndFry6 @aklg98 @chrischirp @adamhfinn @senseaboutsci I lived in Bethnal Green  prior to living on the coast. A couple of times a year I had to go to hospital and go on a nebuliser. I'm well aware of the effects of pollution. I believe w regards covid it hasnt been acknowledged enough. But a vaccine won't help with this. It cd...
1388313708217061379	On that note, I’m not allowed much time with her because of covid restrictions and she can’t talk on the phone because of her bruises but she’s receiving 24 hour care in the ICU. Think I’m going to take a break from social media for a bit to decompress.
1339580582284681218	As a travel nurse, in between contracts, wouldn’t it make the most sense for me to get the CoVid vaccine now? Except they not going to be possible at all. And by the time I return to the hospital setting in Feb- I feel like everyone’s going to be vaccinated and I’ll be SOL. 😟
1385938332715192324	a few months ago i got diagnosed with diabetes. so i lost a bunch of weight, and this week i got told that maybe i might have fixed it?but the funny thing is that i basically had diabetes just long enough to get the covid vaccine early as part of a vulnerable group
1374789252404350979	@apark2453 Covid put me in the ER with a suspected heart attack. I hadn't had one but found out I was diabetic . Which was a shock as I have none of the traditional markers for type 2
1482907116369489920	...and so, I tested positive for COVID. It sucks, but I am thankful na asymptomatic ako because it could've been worse. Pasalamat pa rin tayo that vaccines really work. This will hamper my plans and everything but, let's consider na everything happens for a reason.
1346505503162028032	@ajplus Thousands of workers have tested positive for coronavirus at Nebraska meatpacking plants and the @ACLU  is suing on their behalf.If workers are denied the vaccine, there needs to be a #GeneralStrike and boycott of these companies.I'd support a strike fund for these workers
1386351353568636933	@RealDanielleRae I was diagnosed with covid in November 2020, I'm not a pathologist so can't tell if the diagnoses was true, I recovered and never complained about people not wearing a mask.  Now the state I live in removed the mask mandate I will not wear one
1478169881585455110	I’m a hypochondriac so when I wanted to get tested for COVID everyone was telling me that it was pointless. I tested positive 🙃#Anxiety #quarantaine https://t.co/mAhj5R2U3z
1503315150119579650	@jh336405 @NMadeinNZ they live with me that’s why !and i don’t go out as i’m unwell.(not covid) .They all had hardly any symptoms . They all did pcr test and were positive . i never get the flu either maybe i have a strong immune system .
1378980276639006722	@Mrgriers @GMB @Edwina_Currie You weren’t listening then - I said I had tested positive for antibodies. Try and be less covid cultish and not just choose what you want to hear.
1483439029857230854	I got tested positive for covid somehow?!?
1584235109355425792	Having 3 family members in the hospital this past month and now my Nan has covid😓 Can the world just give my family a break please❤️‍🩹
1377786113297895424	There’s a mindset among some people our age that COVID won’t really affect us even if we get it, so there’s no rush to get vaccinatedI thought that too, until I got COVID last year which caused Pneumonia &amp; forced me to go to the hospital. Get vaccinated ASAP!#ModernaMafia https://t.co/p0HzktBzza
1389286534457683971	It's 🍊💋 like this that will keep us from eradicating covid forever. I was 19. Healthy. Vibrant. WHAM. Diagnosed w/ severe lupus that changed my life forever. Tell me, how could I have been more responsible?
1550487429941002240	@BrianGi95884700 @JoJoFromJerz Believe or not some still do. In my wildest dreams I don’t know how or why but they do. I think most of those are Q. They say it’s just a bad Flu &amp; not Covid. Even while in the hospital they refused to say it was covid. I don’t get it??
1421400349043093504	@BobsMarley5 9907 is one of the 9 from the first 10,000 cases still in hospital. He's 82 (maybe 83 now?) so probably has other issues going on.Can't say if they're Covid related or not, but I'm sure it didn't help.
1439275032312619013	Kind of upset that I tested positive for covid as a vaccinated person when my unvaccinated roommate was negative fml
1431176439957708801	@Mandy98783651 @nadhimzahawi Define a case pleaseFrom what I understand it is a perfectly healthy person doing a flawed PCR or LFT test showing positive.The real stats should be people in ICU because of COVID not in ICU after a car crash who then tests positive !
1550601958666510344	@4Yourinformati3 Just followed you. Vaxxed &amp; boosted x 2. Mask still on my face. Spent weeks in icu with Covid. I’m a pulmonary specialist - not taking chances.
1382666963856556034	If you have a loved one in the hospital possibly dying from Covid maybe take a break from concerts and super spreader events for a bit? Idk just my 2 cents
1551182137054957568	I tested positive this morning for COVID and im sad. Thankfully its mild so far. Only places i could have gotten it are outside when I adjusted my mask waiting for the bus or when i got my piercing last week despite the shops COVID safety protocols.

1469488818776522757	@JeffBarnettUSA @Yasthetwit @RobertKennedyJr Try to remember that TV receives most of its advertising dollars from pharma. They tell you what pharma wants them to tell you. You are only hearing one side of the story. I do not know anyone who’s died, or even gone to the hospital from covid, I can’t say that about the vaccine
1519426271591256066	all the liberals will get covid (with no symptoms, won't be hospitalized, no deaths) i think it may be allergy with all pollen right now.
1355855470716739586	Day 4 of isolation due to covid...Ironically tested positive 9 days after receiving dose 1 of the vaccine, just goes to show how unpredictable this virus really is! Hoping everyone stays safe, and thinking of my colleagues on the front line ♥️#covid19 #nhs

1458919892330110980	@WholeMarsBlog If you're vaxxed, still could have been covid, just too low of a viral load to get a positive test. Or it could be the hellish rhinovirus that I am recovering from. I know 4 people from 2 states that had it last week. I'm in the cold sore/swollen lymph node phase. 🤧
1482191064236806154	Keep in mind, I had covid over the holidays. I was exposed on Fri 12/18, was symptomatic by Tues 12/22, and tested negative three times before testing positive on Sat 12/25. So I lived through this exact lag between exposure, presentation, and test results.
1438485202465132553	@KateTagseth @CTVNews Let's say you do get COVID.  Will you be going to the hospital or staying home? I am just wondering and not trying to be judgmental.
1477927065626329088	First week off work in ages and both my boyfriend and I have tested positive for covid 😩😭🦠
1545588836759179264	I went out partying drinking and doing drugs sleeping with randoms Thursday-Monday… Tuesday morning wake up with Covid symptoms. Wednesday fully fledged. Positive test. Moral of the story. Have fun and be safe.
1447420565979947014	@Bitcrash4 💉💉 here. Happy to accept and follow medical science. I’ve done it for 43 years and will continue to visit my GP, my local pharmacist for prescriptions and go to hospital if required. Will anti covid vaxxers be as consistent with shunning medical science when they require it?

1526582355095191552	@_plishy_ This just happened to me, thought It was my chronic sinusitis, then a nasty cough developed into a severe cough overnight. Covid test the next day said negative, the following day (15 hours after) tested positive. Luckily I was able to make the paxlovid 5-day window
1516092067742732295	@TreyOlympia If it continues to get worse get checked up man! Also I know you took a test yesterday but also consider taking another one soon just in case! When I had covid I tested negative one day and tested positive two days later

1411685786865618950	@Normanjam671 For fear of sounding like a 'covid denier' (which I'm not), they died *for any reason within 28 days of a positive test*. I believe the average age was around 83.
1384980472011190274	@WillRicci Being able to plan a vacation without having to cancel it because you test positive for COVID is a good reason to get vaccinated! The kind of reason that could persuade some skeptics I know! But you do you, bro.
1437021392961216516	@GoneonFelty @suzanne17818647 @drmwarner @DoFoIsCorrupted Yes the reporting mechanism has been gamed by anti Vaxers. I know 3 people ( out of 10) who have been in hospital for covid. I know 25x as many who got the vaccine for covid and not one of them went to the hospital
1389275533062508544	As I say, it's not yet well studied, so this isn't definitive, but one of the studies on long covid in kids found that, in kids who had been previously diagnosed with covid, over 40% had long covid.

Covid also caused some abcesses on my feet to get worse and have spent time twice in the hospital for them since I got over Covid.
1471224331233640454	Well today was interesting.  I had been back at work for precisely one and a half days (after being off with 3 children getting Covid in succession) before child no4 also tested positive. I was due to have 10days child free but now I have snuggles and lego and films instead. 😬

1455231819272572931	@KristySwansonXO So, I guess you’ve been hospitalized every year for the flu? Hmm?  I hope you apologize to EVERY SINGLE HEALTHCARE WORKER during your visit to the Covid ward.  I mean, while you can… Karma keeps the score.
1348323584687575040	@JoeBiden Please pay attention to science !! Withholding 2nd doses of Covid vaccine is NOT tested. You may negate ALL positive potential doing so. NO CREDIBLE SCIENTIST (i.e +CDC/Dr Fauci) supports late 2nd dosing. We just got rid of a potus who hated science. Dont be that guy!
1514499224343302144	@hicksyalex I think the fear of testing positive has far outweighed the fear of covid for a long time . That’s purely based on social media posts where a positive test (with little or no symptoms) is posted like a badge of honour 😏
1375823409616199680	@BorisJohnson maybe consider half doses for under 40s?Half doses for people with positive covid test results. Given the choice i would agree to this.

1445855824669184004	@SteveRDaugh @EricSpracklen I never said anything about mega doses. I had Covid-19 in mid December but wouldn't have known without a positive test. My wife is an RN so I've been taking regular doses of Zinc, D3, B Complex and C. Had the MMR vaccine as a prophylactic and O-. Don't know what helped most.
1419771646139789332	@dasecretamen @Alec_Zeck Right. Seems to me without the jab I have a higher immunity and survival rate. If I have a 99 % chance of not being hospitalized and dying from Covid naturally then why get a vaccine that provides a much lower guarantee?

1479919354116554752	@Dave99117584 @PunditPandemic @JamesSurowiecki @AstorAaron To be clear my specific q for James was re dose 3 for *18yo males with prior covid*. Hard to imagine benefit worth admittedly-very very small myo risk. My kid will be fine. But when you extrapolate that across population, we will put some boys in hospital for no real benefit
1477296509737742338	@ReshadHudson I’m guessing you e seen Fauci’s latest interview where he admits children are not being admitted to the hospital due to Covid?
1385128430388322305	The pandemic in Delhi is at a stage when people who call/message me to ask how’s my family who are Covid +ve are doing are themselves ill or have a near and dear one in the hospital. It’s too much to bear and the government continues to assist and abet the disease. Fuck this.
1475926501526843393	@SkyNews Am I right, if a child tested positive 13 days ago and then breaks there leg. That's classed as a covid admission.

With 40% of cases coming from FL, MO, and TX those folks are in high transmission areas.  I understand if VT doesn’t 😷🆙 or the whole nation, but there are places where action is required. https://t.co/nrINgo6dYD
1470445433402970115	@hannmart Never tested positive for covid. Just the vaccine. Thankfully the symptoms of the myocarditis are gone. But it was really bad for a few months. I still occasionally get a pain and the involuntary coughs that come with it.

1458781043780202497	@JamesMartinSJ 6,000,000 children aged 0-17 have been officially diagnosed with Covid. 850 deaths. That is a 0.014% chance of death.  A much higher chance of horrific complications from the shot. I cheer on the Church for this stance!

1523290756198281218	@KimIversenShow It's allergy season and I believe many are writing off covid as just allergies therefore not getting tested. My guess is there's alot more covid positive people out there than people know about.

1356053955592130560	@Debra4KAG Would the vaccine cause a positive test? However, even with the flu vaccine, a person can still get the flu, but it’s usually a much lighter case. I think the Covid vaccine may work the same.

To you that means it's equal so the vaccine is ineffective.
1475784536973885443	Unfortunately my Da has tested positive for Covid, I'm currently still testing negative on the LFTs but just to be safe I shall simply have to stay in bed for the next week.A noble sacrifice, I assure you all.

1559564708637822976	If anything is elitist it’s these people at the top of the food chain telling all the little people they tested positive for Covid.  Like, “oh my God!!! As soon as I’m done checking out at WalMart with the rest of the masses I’ll say some prayers for you. Please hang in there.”

1442923135452397569	@DailyChef7 @Quicktake 73% of ppl are vaccinated, 187 cases of covid (most we've had at once,) and only 5 have been linked to unvaxxed so far. There is no public data on fully vaxxed who have covid or are hospitalized where I live, but do the math. See my tweet on the Canadian posts article about it.
1580728038076973056	@Robrt_McMillan @SH_BordenColley I know a guy who was in isolation in the hospital because he’d just received a stem cell transplant. Only people allowed the room were hospital staff. He got infected with Covid. (Managed to survive, thankfully). Disgraceful nonetheless.

I asked the doctor if he had read the clinical trial reports. He said, no. I said read them and then come back. He did later that day and apologized.
1472359714755334151	He went to the ER, he states later, because he had low oxygen saturation. Not for a COVID test. I hate shitty little liars.(Though to be fair, he wrote this perhaps while mentally compromised with low O2.)

1372622798460424192	@YardleyShooting But it will show you have the antibodies won't it - isn't that what the vax does? I would also bet that you test positive for Covid. Why not go and get tested for Covid? At least then you might get some medical attention?
1477426256723562498	@jemillerwbal Im afraid these numbers are far from accurate - as they are not including the majority of the rapid home tests.

1520624813773053953	@loscharlos I had severe covid Jan. 22. I was hospitalized for 3 wks. I'm pretty sure I don't have long covid. I have couple residual covid recovery issues. I think the heavy duty hosp. drugs saved me from long covid. Most people who got covid were not hospitalized and didn't get those meds.
1340132564074434566	#CNNTownHall I am a Covid Nurse and was in hospital 5 weeks ago with Covid. Should I still det vaccine?
1341927953500794881	I have worked @UCSFHospitals hands on with #COVIDー19 patients since March at least 3 days/week. Mostly in the ICU-And I still do. No vaccine and no vaccine appointment offered to me yet. Same for my #Covid_19 PT/OT colleagues.
1372956455918256132	Well I Dont have Covid 19 Corona Virus my Test is Negative  ..so I'm Going to be Checking into the Hospital 🏥 after 6 Tonight ...
1434528856048766979	@mrdruthers In Alberta 88% of the ICU cases of Covid are the unvaccinated.  The unvaccinated also represent 74% of total Covid cases in hospital.  Surgeries are being cancelled to surge more ICU capacity.  I think we know who’s selfish in this scenario.
1439191965304774656	25-35 is young to ME! Lol - in all seriousness talk to your doctor about being vaxxed if you aren’t. The vaccine is helpful in many ways; sometimes you won’t even catch the COVID, and if you do you have a lesser chance of going to hospital or dying compared to those w/o vaccine
1417087439206817796	@FPWellman I posted on Saturday about someone I grew up with who is 55 years old he lives in Jacksonville and he was hospitalized with Covid. His wife said on the post they were not vaccinated and that was a personal choice, she posted today that he died. So unnecessary
1429320815162519557	@MikeTagliereNFL sad to hear my favorite   Fantasy football podcast member has COVID and is in the icu. I pray that you make it back to your family.
1518397670942908427	@MarieDickens16 @noahzark333 @Gabby164674711 @NSWHealth Me too , death of a family member 52 yo . And now 30 yo previously healthy has long covid after a mild case  . Admitted to hospital with lung issues . Not everyone has the luxury to stay at home or work from home as Luke suggests . I don't think he's thought that one thru .
1475165043771723781	reaaaally hope my covid positive roommates dont try to come back to the apartment if i test negative lol
1442921923877367810	It hasn’t even been two days of lectures and why did someone in my social psych class test positive for covid…are you fucking serious
1421787235192610816	@NessaNessssa @AsToldByKristen Literally 99% of people in the hospital and dying of COVID are unvaccinated. You're fucking delusional and I can't wait to hear who you blame when your loved ones wither and die because of your stupidity.
1478109893689229314	Guess who tested positive for COVID 😭😭 ME! Now I die alone now 😂 everything for sure is on hiatus
1456745206003372040	@sfpd2217 @jjones9 I mean…vaccinated or not…with a positive test, one can miss games…look at Davonte Adams So even though Mahomes is vaxxed…he could miss games if he contracted Covid
1386898153299857408	@GVAJr77 I think multnomah is next Friday. The criteria was if we hit over 300 covid hospitalizations AND have a 15% or greater increase in cases on the week to week, they'd put us back in extreme.317 hospitalized &amp; a 61% increase in cases over the last 2 weeks.
1476854566272573465	@GBNEWS Three quarters of people with cold symptoms are having a cold and test positive for Covid. I call that good news.
1480665233077112832	And this is someone we’re meant to look up to? 🙄 What kind of person goes and visits people including kids for 2 days after they found out they’ve tested positive to Covid?!?! No longer someone I can respect and support.
1396162166277869570	@NuovaRealta Am Arun from INDIA,My wife (27yrs)is critically ill and admitted in hospital ICU (PAST 40 DAYS)due to serious infection,brain damage which not related to Covid.

1478616997038637056	@Danime9071 @Time_Rocker @qz And that’s why history is important 😊 although a lot of people are calling it CRT for some reason 🤔 I think a lot of those same people are in the hospital struggling to breathe due to Covid and not following common sense. We can use Science to explore all this and make it fun! https://t.co/gKXNNdYjCD
1432800218228133892	@ETBowden @DrEricDing Can someone tell me why I did not show symptoms for Delta. I sat next to my Covid + husband for seven days without a mask. He was hospitalized I showed zero symptoms even though I expected infection. He survived. We both had the J&amp;J month ago. I thank God every day.
1479203665344966662	Everyday I'm hearing people say they tested positive forCovid - some haven't even been near people in weeks, are boostered &amp; fully vaxd - how's Fauchi going to swing this one
1429147119072550918	@magi_jay @NateSilver538 I think that you have to look at the difference between areas with very high vaccination rates and areas without. I live in an area with very high vaccination rates - there are very few COVID patients in the hospital and only one death from COVID in the past week (out of 700,000)
1540442473583054849	aaaaaand I just tested positive for COVID 🙃 https://t.co/HOZZ5ccbgY
1377693372689842182	My patient died of COViD today after a long fight in the hospital. She was 54 years old. She had no “pre-existing conditons”.    None.   😞
1515063697982443521	Incorrect, I had had all 👇🏻 and tested positive.“Meanwhile, COVID does not usually cause sneezing, itchy or watery eyes, a runny or stuffy nose, or sore throat, which are common allergies symptoms, the CDC says.”https://t.co/SAHzy7v20j
1483637313624317955	ok idk wtf i meant by ‘he has positive’ ::he tested positive for covid ,,,, too distracted to type correctly
1429962856636706832	When someone tells me I shouldn’t get an ICU bed at a hospital if I have Covid &amp; I’m unvaxxed, you have nothing to worry about because I don’t run to the hospital when I get mildly sick. If I’ve had Covid &amp; it wasn’t bad for me, I’m not concerned about ending up in the hospital.
1471083902936752137	today alone four people i know have tested positive. a bunch more last week toothat makes almost all the fun people positive with covid right now. what am i meant to do with myself? 🤷🏾‍♀️
1490800257927573505	@doctormaxine I just spent several days in hospital.Everyone is required to wear a mask all the time.Even my Dr.Wouldn’t come in my room until I put mine on! I was on a floor where to get to be on this floor you had tobe vaccinated and have a booster plus negative COVID test just before entry!
1525137805474775040	Now I must go write a test with many other people even though I tested positive for Covid because NUST doesn’t care. Just great.
1472473882527293445	@dxsbond @Lbb_52 @Nlechoppa1 But that is not the case,if you educated yourself you would know the facts. If you get the vaccine your chances of going into the hospital from your symptoms is lessened. YOU CAN STILL GET AND TRANSMIT COVID TO OTHERS WITH OR WITHOUT THE VACCINE. Thank you for joining my Ted Talk
1385475225563762688	@narayanank when I had contacted Corona in may 2020, I was advised by physician to stay home hill I had oxygen level of 90%. fortunately I recovered after hitting a low of 91%. I think it is better to be treated at home because half virus load is hire in hospital
1409533762464010249	we’re driving home from cornwall bc my mum tested positive for covid (even though she tested negative before leaving) and now i think i have it too https://t.co/eDbxHylkkM
1553801044685213697	@MBlake0609 @silverfiire Last month, while visiting NYC, I caught COVID. Badly. High fevers. Awful symptoms. Still had to drive home. So, in the interest of keeping the rest of my family well, we all masked. Nobody else got sick but me. Oh, and  I was hospitalized when we got home — wasn’t “just a cold”.
1480547617889206274	@paulxharris Yup they sure are. My team partner was home last week with covid. Tested positive again today with symptoms and HR told her to come to school tomorrow. WTH?
1385464069033918465	Damn we could be going into lockdown again, someone from my city flew to Melbourne and just got tested positive for covid
1341562714431352833	@JDangzalan I work at a hospital too, Guera. There isn't any way I am getting the vaccine prior to anyone working in the ICU or on the COVID floors. I don't even know what Tier I am considered to be.
1596289498857451520	So I tested positive for Covid again. Which means I’m isolating myself for another five days. 😢
1397960851341012992	@mkvenu1 Am Arun from TN-Cuddalore,My wife (27yrs)is critically ill and admitted in hospital ICU (PAST 46 DAYS)due to serious infection,brain damage which not related to Covid.

1334315176032567296	@CurlyJungleJake I am told to not get flu shots because I was once diagnosed with a mild case of Guillain-Barré syndrome following a bad flu. 30 yrs ago! I am worried the Covid vaccine may also carry this warning. Will wait and see.
1380079784173051908	@RougeNoirUK literally anyone at any time could test positive, ive known people who went and signed up to get tested but left yet still got positive results. @fatbellybella tested positive in one nostril and negative in the other, more proof covid does NOT exist.
1506189637492039685	@Walkabout24 Oh yes !! I’ve got two customers who both tested positive in the last week . Both triple jabbed 😵‍💫 one was positive and didn’t tell me and I found her test 🤣 didn’t bother me I’ve been actively trying to catch Covid for two years - maybe I will finally get it 🤷🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/ez5t28onvc
1463218800300634115	@WHCOS This is so stupid.  I know a dentist, who is fully vaccinated, just tested positive for Covid.  Vaccines don’t work, but now his natural antibodies will.
1529888334054580224	@hugh_mankind Virtually everyone I know caught covid. None were hospitalized, none died except  for several who died in senior care prior to the vaccine. We are all still here because of the vaccine, most hospitalized and dead folks were anti vaxxers, got sucked into the disinfo , now😵😵
1380970122932805635	@DonasTheHorse @JennyC_VA @blaketopia I remember when you were in the hospital. So glad You made it through but what a hellish virus.  Are you ok? Any long Covid?
1444487733523664896	This tweet is now the reason that this Saturday is one of my best Saturday’s in years. Even with being diagnosed with a nasty bout of COVID on the same day. 😂
1420569280672899078	I was minutes away from death in the ICU last year when I had covid.  I said no to nothing.  Was out of work for 6 months with breathing problems and blood clots.  I took vaccine February this year.  It's your life.  Fight for it. Get vaccinated.
1548021245236523010	"Yes, I Have COVID: BeforeMyMorningCoffee07152022 https://t.co/K50r5MVmAg via @YouTube I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, ""Pfeifer, you look like crap!"" You're right of course. Because I tested positive for #COVID. Or at least that's my excuse--and I'm sticking to it!"
1542285402547130368	@Carolyn_Bennett I also recently tested positive for covid.  I was feeling fine.  I have NOT received any vaccines or boosters.  Funny how natural immunity works.  Good luck!!!
1479309776328675329	"@GinTonHic @Michael82150005 Wrong. I'm basing my statements on the Alberta and Ontario governments' own numbers. If the shots allow for that many ""vaxxed"" people to become sick and hospitalized, explain to me - based on the definition of the word ""vaccine"" - how the Covid shot is a vaccine. https://t.co/NZz6F3bHIk"
1388654437556801537	@kayaeger1 I feel your pain. My partner was due to get his vaccine the day he died of Covid in Feb. He caught it while in hospital for another emergency. He was 52.
1397532147137789959	One of my GF patients was in ICU from Covid and is now out and on the mend and he’s a Yankee fan, love to see it. https://t.co/DDtThsadbc
1345466020056551424	#DrTwitter Why are ppl testing positive after getting the vaccine? Is a negative #covid test before receiving it? Help me understand what’s happening.
1375078351577174018	Proud to take part in the #SIREN study with @PublicHealthW. Blood test results show I have tested positive for #COVID SARS antibodies following both vaccines 💉 So be wise and immunise folks #vaccination #vaccines

As it seems there is dishonesty occurring where of dying WITH covid but not of it, which has never been the practice before, even if hit by a bus within 28 days of a PCR positive test. Why not the same rule apply with jabs?
1531335091129139200	@pulte I've recently been diagnosed with covid, and i could really use the $ to pay my rent &amp; my other bills i have. love the work you do! cashapp is $realprincessg
1377219676560785409	Someone I know rang a house at Clunes near Lismore today, only to be told the residents had Covid and were in hospital. Haven't seen that reported in NSW yet.
1468472914282364930	@nihardesai7 My granny was diagnosed to have tb while doing a CT chest for COVID admission one year back.. sputum came as MDR Tb.. purely incidental detection.. she recovered from both. one way or another COVID is better than TB. #TBsucks
1370005089688117253	@ginapanettieri There is a very large group that propagates the myths about the vaccines being dangerous and being unnecessary and COVID being a very mild illness. I spend a lot of my time at work in the hospital educating people abt vaccine benefits.
1607411737254592514	So last Christmas I was in bed with Covid and now this Christmas I was in the hospital for emergency surgery (I'm okay now at least). Let's hope next Christmas nothing happens!
1484458263080935424	@DarshanRavalDZ Raval i tested positive for covid 3 days back and currently in isolation
1466926712390926352	@Thogar How long has it been since symptoms showed up? It could still be covid (I really hope it's not) but I see this almost daily at our school. Quick test positive, PCR negative, goes back to school, two days later, PCR positive. Might just be a nasty regular bug. Feel better soon!
1387075401982398476	@LayItOnEmUA12 @AlexBerenson @CDCgov I had covid in Dec 2020. Only symptom was loss of smell for 4 days. Thats it. Tested positive for antibodies a month later. I personally wont be getting the shot.
1376910281713008649	@Paris__G But at anytime any player could contract Covid (or the team quite frankly). God forbid they end in the hospital, the ICU, or worse. I am looking at this from a public health perspective 1/2

1466367553790480392	@IAGovernor I'd sincerely like to know if Reynolds or any GOP in state leadership have visited COVID units. Many of us would happily give you a tour. I mean the Iowa GOP should visit given it's primarily their base getting hospitalized because of GOP Anti-vax and anti-masking lies.

1529140706874474502	I've been watching the COVID numbers closely as we undergo this latest wave with the new variant. At the hospital where I work, the number of patients currently hospitalized with COVID is less than 1/8th the number we hit at the peak of Omicron in January.

1420644999138525186	@irishrygirl Exactly what I've been saying for quite some time. Saw one Covidiot interviewed while still in recovery say he still will not get the vaccine when and if he survives and gets out. But wants his health insurance to pay for being in the hospital.
1302776888310587395	"@PAULIBABBA @EverSouthern @realDonaldTrump I ""supposedly "" had covid. Tested positive 2x. Think it's suspect that the virus comes out, the tests come out, and a vaccine is supposed to be released ALL IN LESS THAN A YEAR!?!? I call BS How long does it normally take for the FDA or WHO to make the available?🤔"
1384772534520848385	Took a covid test a couple of days ago because I had mild symptoms. Had a full blown panic attack when I got a positive result. Turns out it was the wrong report and I got someone else's. I don't know what to feel anymore.
1433282172585189376	🤔 Will it stop you getting Covid? People still end in hospital when vaccinated. I wonder is it the same % that end in hospital before vaccine roll out?
1473449241355984899	@BriannaDulgeri1 @rudygcarp12 Okay, two days short of being considered “ fully vaxed”. Play semantics, God bless. But you go ahead , show me an unvaxed player who has been hospitalized. John Feliciano went to ER on Sunday with Covid, fully vaxed.
1377207343532941313	@mikechristmas22 @TinseltownMayor @nikkifried NP. My favorite one on record is the motorcycle rider who crashed and died. Morgue tested him positive, so on his death certificate he died from covid and was added to the total. Can only imagine how many more were of that variety.
1478508481657384963	@NightWatchman21 @BostonGlobe If there are far more people who are vaccinated than are not vaccinated, then of course more people who are vaccinated will get Covid. Also, I could be wrong, but the people who are not vaccinated are getting hospitalized/put in ICU at a much greater rate than those who aren't.
1484924479746752513	The same reason hospitals are paid an enormous fee for declaring a patient has covid!  They did for me when I was in the hospital, and never once tested me to see if I even had it!

Esp in these covid days.I just get grumpy with a feeling like we carry an excess of the risk in the ED (suspect many GPs feel same)
1484711597184806913	"@AngryNMTeacher @abq_united If I gave another non vaxed person covid and they die, Visa versa you said you wouldn't care.  The facts are people with 2 shots and booster are still getting it, ending up in hospital.  This ""vax"" isnt a vax its like taking flu meds."
1510159482458116100	@myrenekala if i'm not mistaken, medical professionals don't recommend taking another pcr test within 2 months after contracting covid bc they would turn up positive. but i get your point
1388664018588606464	@iliketeslas The amount of misinformation in the general public is absolutely astounding. Just as recently as this weekend, a patient sick with Covid was forced by family to present to the ER, and while gasping for air, all he could spew to my colleagues was how he was being conspired against
1437798978616168450	@AnaCabrera Wow! Vaccines are MUCH MORE CHEAPER than being admitted to the hospital.I don't understand the mindset of KNOWING about all the DEATHS and still walk around UNVACCINATED. 🇺🇲😷I don't understand it.  smh#COVID19vaccine #Hospital #Deaths

Would you go into hospital not wearing face mask? Would you talk to people with Covid without wearing face mask?
1386360042279026688	@MiaFarrow Hospitalized twice.5 nights first trip while getting covid IV. Released and return days later with respiratory failure. Now I have Diabetes, COPD, high blood pressure and pneumonia in both lungs. Primary says unfortunately this is a new disease, so no idea if damage is permanent

1507355455768924162	Yikes I’ve just tested positive to covid. Thank gosh for vaccines but can say it’s not a pleasant experience either way. 7 days iso here we come.
1340339535813758977	so far a nurse has fainted minutes after getting the covid vaccine and i heard someone else was rushed to the hospital after receiving it from a rash all over their body and they couldn’t breath. so it’s gonna be no from dog

1385407698766864384	I would love to see someone who test positive for Covid, also test for the flu and pneumonia at the same time, and see the results. THAT would be interesting, since the flu and pneumonia have supposedly almost disappeared.
1478434339138461698	@thedailybeast Then she died from something else but still tested positive for COVID.I had Covid and survived it. It was a Delta variant.

1476238244190773248	hey y’all unfortunately I tested positive for covid last night which means I can’t go to work and I can’t afford to stop working right now.

1428603085329473538	3.  Daniel Israel, GP#COVID jabs dramatically reduce your chances of ending up in ICU/dying of #COVID. Jabs protect you from falling seriously ill with #COVID. I see this playing out in my practice: Vaccinated patients can still get #COVID, but they rarely fall seriously ill.
1475254312716668928	Plot twist: my positive covid test finally scared them.
1476221813810241542	“I’m jabbed and I still caught covid!”Yep. Because it’s not supposed to stop you catching it. It’s supposed to stop you becoming seriously ill if and when you do catch it.That’s why you’re at home on your sofa and not in hospital on a ventilator.
1477999804735234049	@sadistic__demon i go back on the 5th but if my covid test is positive again i go back on the 10th
1488200915450400769	@JustinTrudeau There was no violence, you are exploiting people’s fears you are the cause of all of this … hello is @JustinTrudeau I am triple vaccinated and I tested positive for Covid-19 get vaccinated get boosted I trust the science … you are a joke
1487259735829139458	Finally almost done with COVID, tested negative today. Wasn't really that bad for me, I'm assuming because I was vaccinated (Although I haven't gotten a booster yet). Although my heart goes out to the people who have been hospitalized and on ventilators, hope you all get better!
1387113577065205776	My 87y/o neighbour, who survived Covid last year, spent 2wks in hospital after the jab this year, now has a blood clot.
1403673427626635266	Be interesting to see how many people in hospital with Rona have had two vaccinations and no underlying health issues. I'm going to have a guess at zero. #COVID19 #June21st
1384908841452777477	@TheAuthorGuy I've shown no symptoms whatsoever through all of this.Tested positive for COVID last Nov, tested often before that.I had a long flu battle in Oct. 2019. Maybe that bolstered my immunities + mask wearing kept the viral load small.Received my second Pfizer shot 4 days ago. 👍
1376935147476557825	@SdOceanSea @FireBallNPizza @SandalsAnew @Miriamgh57 @ColoradoKaren Yes, I was sick in the hospital for seven days Nov 2019 with influenza A&amp;B and double pneumonia. I was so sick. Pneumonia has never put me in the hospital before.They weren’t  testing for coronavirus, yet. Who is this guy..is there a link to the CDC study?

1446880716290207752	@mkohlrogge @JedediahBila This doesn’t conflict with what I’ve said. Yes, you can still get Covid after being infected and it can be serious. As the article points out, over 70% of the eligible population was vaxxed at time of writing and appx half of hospitalized were vaxxed.  50% of 70% v 50% of 30%.
1479509111272132617	@MarcusPM2501 @Joshua_Newcomb5 @Kevinoz41698 @taydertot When I got covid in April 2020 I didn't end up in the hospital and I didn't get sick again until after I got my vaccination in June 2021, then I got sick again and again and again and I'm finally getting over this last sickness. The vaccines are amazing.
1330091014741237761	@mark_toshner @Gillyheeds I am 59 and have benefited from various vaccines. However this is a novel vaccine. Moreover should I take it if I test positive for t-cell immunity, or if I had COVID and recovered? Would appreciate your answers.
1382034291224420364	@_Innovation_ @MadelaineLucieH @DeniseMembery Nobody can give you those figs because pCR test gives too many false positives &amp; #COVID19 is placed on death certificate if one had a false positive 28days b4 dying - whereas they don’t put down died of adverse jab reaction@28days after one has died.Remind me how many died of flu
1477343169431834625	Was very excited to have a nice long weekend to finally relax since I've been dying of stress. I have since getting off work thu had to evacuate my house due to a massive fire, driven through a snowstorm to come back home, and then had 2 roommates test positive for COVID
1376397910124810245	Got a call from a customer and while she was not coughing up lung all she kept saying is “I went to get a COVID test at CVS and it said I came out positive..I don’t appreciate the lies you guys are saying” First Lady...this particular store does not test for COVID..she yelled 😑
1399788084045271042	@cbai77 @just_mindy No. They had put him on Cephalexin 500mg (it is not for treating virus's) before they diagnosed him with Covid. He had been taking it several days, when they put him on Ivermectin. I think Azithromicin is probably more commonly used. I am not a doctor.
1436738020305145865	@JamesMelville the US only counts covid cases among unvax or hospitalized break thru cases i.e. where arr we really compared to Israel?
1474996063648075778	@DjCarlo88813657 @CNN This isn’t true. Someone in my family tested positive 7 days ago and retested today and they still have Covid (omicron) can last longer than you think. Get vaccinated.
1376339549094297600	The fact that I can’t see a family member in the hospital because of covid but mask bans are lifted and bars are still open
1476359551251369988	i didn’t just take major precautions during this whole pandemic for my roommate to simply test positive for covid.
1374421662716682241	Happy Anniversary to the time I asked for prayers on FB because my husband, Aaron Tveit, tested positive for covid and got this message from my 7th grade English teacher from my conservative hometown 🥺 there’s always hope! https://t.co/X6n0WAjAfa
1444794819465949187	@DruvBhagavan @Mrneilhistory @DrTomFrieden No that isn’t what I asked for. When I have influenza I was diagnosed from a test and the test itself came back Influenza A &amp; B!  It didn’t just say Influenza. So where is there a test for the Covid from a doctor where the patient had the Delta Variant
1376904754006228994	NYU students! Did you receive a positive covid test? Would you be willing to talk about NYUs response for a WSN article? Please DM me!
1478251470206107648	@marcorubio I’m guessing if they test positive for Covid, then they still have covid.
1575577751888633856	Currently in ER receiving IVIG treatment due to autoimmune disorder. Man in bed next to me is Covid +. Thanks, DoFo for putting me in the path of serious illness.
1347638325671288833	@NYGovCuomo Hey how about not talking about football and let families get Covid tested so we can visit.  Yes i know that’s part of the guidelines but but the staff that won’t take the vaccine keeps testing positive and visits get cancelled for 14 days and then another 14 and so on.
1376771619759214599	Kim Mulkey saying they shouldn’t COVID test anymore in the Final 4 is bogus, but I actually agree with the root of her point. One positive shouldn’t kill a whole team if all others on said team are negative and can pass multiple tests after the positive.
1484176425003356161	Well here’s some news to ruin my week…Apparently someone on the first and second floors of our office building tested positive for COVID.It’s not an official exposure classification, but work says stay home and take rapid antigen tests for the next 5 days.FML
1556228975332311040	@JohannaSzabo1 @waltjosephs @ToddPri67435657 @Scoops20211 @NSWHealth @Taniabanks24 And after having covid I'm fine perfectly normal just like I had a flu I don't usually test but did it for shits and gigs and it was positive lol if I have a flu I stay home I don't spread it like a normal person so can't we just use the same common sense
1351129665809821703	@WelshGovernment Why won’t you answer my question of how many people that has had the vaccine and then tested positive for covid a few weeks later it worries me that you are not being transparent and may be hiding the numbers and cannot believe none of the MSM have asked this question
1438716928420290560	I tested positive a month ago. And i already met many people outside. Di naman sila nag positive because of me. Sana man lang di tayo maging close minded because of covid

1481722118505054209	@sayitnspinit Vaxxed person gave me Covid in August myself and my wife ended up in the hospital we where married 41 years so in my mind that guy killed my wife and I lost my job cause I can’t work now so vaxxed people piss me off cause they act so indignant
1553802393510453248	@MEYERCO @BayouBabe63 @chuckwoolery Never vaxed. Had COVID omicron in Oct. 2021, Never hospitalized back to work in four days. ( I work from home) Yes I had symptoms, but fought it with over the counter meds. Now I have built in immunity which is probably why I didn't get it twice. Science will eventually win out.
1584963143431647232	@TopherRuggles I had COVID before it was officially designated. Was hospitalized and on oxygen. Sustained permanent lung damage (nonsmoker.) So healthy that I didn't have so much as a cold in 20+. Had brain fog &amp; severe depression for about 8-9 months. It slowly cleared up. It was a scary time.
1420201219688177664	"@SabrinaJoyDC CLI is ""Covid Like Illness"". Its a measure of how many people coming into the ER are showing symptoms of Covid. The CDC moved to a direct diagnosis months ago (i.e. a positive test result). NJ hasnt, so if you have RSV and show up with a cough, you're counted as a CLI"

1479102045810573315	@covid_parent Where I’m from, covid spreads if the unvaccinated, negative tested murderer types attempt to go into a liquor store. But doesn’t spread when positive covid tested vaccinated go into a liquor store. Liquor is a super spreader. But only for the unvaxxed.
1348674043608768512	@lpryanovichcom2 Yes, I'm in GA. I have questions about checks &amp; vaccines. Why are red states like FL &amp; AL getting theirs before others? Also, how can these people get the vaccine and test positive for COVID next day after taking the vaccine? Just curious. Where's the fairness?
1480705037592629248	day 5 of i still haven’t receive my covid test results yet: i’m cleared to go back to work tomorrow and have not had a fever the entire time. was i positive? probably. am i broke now because i missed work for 4.5 days? hella.

1389041387681640448	@6pintsofkramer @PabloEscobarner I couldn’t know if a student in my in-person class this Spring tested positive for COVID. Hippa is real...
1450003483801931778	@NotAlexSheppard Covid is the flu. Covid is the cold. I got the real thing and beat it all on my own. 3 doctor visits, 24 hour stay in the hospital. I did it all on my own. Never prescribed anything. Give it to me. I am not scared.
1385392884304723968	Covid is no joke I’ve been in the hospital for over a month and have weeks still to rehab my body. Can’t walk or talk or move my left arm. This is the worst thing I ever gone through
1472760392124407810	@mny_mrk @Breaking911 I’m not vaxed, I wasn’t hospitalized when I had Covid. Didn’t die either.
1520491127434104833	@PeteLikesPhish @GuyForgetOPT @neddyo It makes me really angry that people would go to the show knowing they had Covid. I tested positive the day before I was supposed to go, it killed me to miss it but it was never a consideration to go. The anti-vax crowd is terrible but going to an event when positive is bad.
1476124970078117888	@MissNursey123 Hi sexy I need cheering up I’ve just tested positive for covid

1339276287383392260	Somebody help me! I don't understand. Why isn't the serious covid patients in the hospital on their death bed given the vaccine first, along with the entire medical staff and doctors?
1426780554049966082	@showupforthis I’ve heard so many news reports about teachers dying from COVID. Each one was somebody’s favorite teacher, or at least a familiar face. I couldn’t imagine how it must feel to come in one day &amp; find out four or more teachers I knew were in the hospital, or just…gone forever.
1427997839519588353	@conservmillen @DocWashburn Allow me to confirm for you that you're correct.Locking down NZ for 1 positive covid test is indeed stupid.And not only stupid, but it also sets a very dangerous precedent.
1385671342092025858	Man I can't wait for covid to be done. My wife has been in the hospital for 3 days and they aren't allowing visitors. I feel for those who are long term patients there and are isolated and lonely
1370477832435032073	@ThoughtsOfTony @Zigmanfreud Let me guess. You believe every death within 30 days of a covid positive test is a covid death, but any death after a vaccine shot is from another cause? That’s inflating deaths and it’s pretty odd how we code our deaths ‘liberally’ hence the need for an audit.
1487170808648712195	My husband has tested positive for Covid. I have so far tested negative. We can't isolate from each other, so we're wearing masks except when eating. Prayers welcome (if you do, well wishes if not), but we don't require advice, as we're doing all we can to mitigate it already.
1503111889555005455	Three people I know tested positive for Covid this week. They live in different states. All vaccinated. Just a reminder that even if we are done with this pandemic, it isn’t done with us. Year three is here.
1532512163549544453	@NanaE1964 @scheib_gary @nathaliejacoby1 Mmmkay. Buuuut if you don’t have covid and keep doing this aren’t you just pretending? Children do pretend things, not educated adults…and you’re so afraid of (dying? Most people survive, I did, heck I wasn’t even hospitalized!) you quit living. Good job.👍🏼
1388432824596897792	like yes antis and solos r terrible but covid has taken so many lives and i’ve known people who were in the hospital fighting to breathe. its still such a huge issue i just think this is really insensitive
1406712529049591812	I don't know why being Corona positive would bring on jeers and sneers. all this means we are probably HIV negative, I do not know what you all are being tested for. You'll be given instruction of what not to do, being HIV negative, especially if in child bearing years, take care

1509729336269713416	@antonmalkin I think so, probably deciding what the rule of classifying Covid death should be nationally. It's said 40% HK deaths are people who died from something else while at the same time tested positive.

1514403406928289794	I tested positive for Covid last Saturday. This is proving to be a long week of the soul. Good luck to all those keeping up the struggle in the outside world! Looks pretty scary from here.
1477855685618581506	@TruthMule @NaheedD I understand how vaccines work. The covid vaccine reduces the severity of the symptoms when someone contracts COVID. If everyone were vaccinated, fewer people would end up in the ICU, reducing the strain on the healthcare system and, in turn, stopping the lockdowns.
1453134940741197828	@amy_casner @ArmandaAndrade @MaryKayH188 @pattyoprince @mary_HistoryFan @Maggie_Maggan @stellaa67754439 @SheriSachse @AishaM131 @Amber25072691 @ShellLvsBenWade But that’s my point. Ppl without COVID same as travellers have to quarantine 14days. But the person that tested positive and is SICK surely has to show a beg test result or get medical clearance by their doctor before the employer allows them back to work. It just sounds so wrong
1564261576819068930	I take Adderal for my ADD. First time taking it since my positive test and it basically just makes me feel like I normally do without COVID brain. Brain fog is real.

1363940573477011458	@SkyNews I don’t think he told us anything we didn’t already know. First few days after the vaccine you have no protection from catching Covid but are less likely to end up in hospital. The effectiveness grows and in five weeks you have good protection. We want max. numbers at 2nd stage.
1450464281988898821	@bollgare @AnnieGardener3 @failingtostop @droverdriver61 @davidbewart Putting aside your attempt to insult me. I dont see how vaccines get us nowhere since they keep people out of hospital and your concern seems to be too many people in hospital with covid
1377426646563627009	@YahooziePoppinS Because we had COVID in January and you have to wait 90 days to get the vaccine. We can’t get it until May and now everyone is getting theirs like, this week 😂 we had appointments but had to cancel them because they were two days after my husband tested positive in January

1374720880908115970	@sushimustwrite Yes, I was briefly masked and distanced around someone who later turned out to be COVID positive so I took the test just to be certain even though I was 99% sure I had not been exposed. I was negative.
1353568027896401926	my year really went from getting the covid vaccine to spending 20 hours in the ER with a ruptured ovarian cyst in a matter of weeks huh

1607494758980636672	@Acheron2000 @MarioTrono @unusual_whales forgot to say no one over 50 I know that’s been vaccinated has even gone in the hospital  due to covid. vaccines work they always have it’s become a frenzy pushed by a bunch of shite media sites. But as they say you can’t teach a pig to sing 🤷🏻‍♂️.

1430755405571923970	@MischievousLiz …I personally don’t care who does or doesn’t get the jab.  My problem is the suppression of cures that are available.  I was fortunate late and took ivermectin for two day and was good as new.  I know a 98 yr old who went to the hospital with COVID and walked out 2 days later….
1334682300332830720	@dochorne If as a Physician I am not allowed to work in the hospital without getting the Flu vaccine, then we should not be allowed to enter the workplace without getting a Covid vaccine, if and when it is available to everyone.

1614083769559924736	@RichieofPi1 @RoxanneHoge @DrLeanaWen I classify COVID hospitalizations the same way as I classify COVID deaths -- if they would not have been hospitalized or would not have died if they had not been infected by SARS2 then it's COVID

1375220708771561478	I realised that so many people go through it. That doesn’t take the pain away, but I think it should be discussed more. Covid also made everything so much worse by not being able to have Harry in the hospital with me when they did an emergency scan to tell me my baby was dying.
1486758803580194826	So Trudeau is claiming a possible covid infection with a negative test. Truth is the RAT tests aren't that decisive. My Robyn tested positive on 6th day knowing, after 2 negatives. But...I don't buy it. He's the PM. He is subjected to covid on a minute by minute basis.
1475981140343209986	@JoeBiden My buddy is double vaxed and boostered and he’s bad covid. Tested positive yesterday. Save the bs. All vaccinations and boosters do is help minimize the symptoms and help your outcome. And that’s still probably worth it, but please stop saying it helps stop transmission.
1350932084890750976	@KatieDaviscourt These immigrants are just going to storm into this country and probably bring other diseases or more of them are going to get covid and get treated in the hospital when we don't have any place to go when we get sick with covid. We will get it before a vaccine. I am certain..

1486866116110876672	Well, as careful as I was, and even though I'm fully vaccinated and boosted, I'm pretty sure my rapid test just showed that I'm positive for COVID. The good news is that now I can just read and play games until I'm negative.
1517295289773830147	@RedTapeLass Ohhh I hope she doesn’t have it too badly. That’s the thing with Covid, it’s so random some people it hardly seems to touch when they test positive and obviously other people die, it’s such a crapshoot! gah

But the data does support that people who got the vaccine do not get hospitalized at the same rate as unvaccinated people and are extremely unlikely to die from covid. Hell yeah the vaccine is selfish! I don't wanna get sick!

1543088879938351104	@sweetkeet @TheShoeLady33 The thing is, healthy ~40 year olds (like me) don’t really run a chance of being hospitalized from Covid.  The original variant hospitalization rate was &lt;1% in my age group.But the all cause mortality for vaccinated people in my age group has gone through the roof in 2021.
1412613403575787522	@RoyNemer Been my keeper all fantasy season 🤘  Ridiculous to think we had to wait for a covid positive test to have Emi as #1
1512332096240508933	@BarryMcAree @JakeOKane @WHO What can we, as the public, do 2 make some noise and force the hand of the hospitals to upgrade the protection for staff &amp; patients, and clean the air?  I dread having to go into hospital even more than normal, because I KNOW I will probably come home with Covid if take mask off!
1416178385131393024	@4ever2paradise @kirstiealley Well in the uk some people who are double vaccinated are in hospital with COVID, I’m. It having a “ vaccine” that doesn’t work, what is the point?
1532363856600760320	Not me randomly taking a Covid test, hoping it’s positive so I don’t have to works… who would do such a thing?
1392616131316359173	I have two family members who died lately and were counted by UK Gov as COVID-19 deaths.•••It was not covid that ended their lives.•Not at all.••We need the daily figures to separate data for “died of” and “died with” and “died within X no days of a positive test.”
1445527700031016961	@IainMulady @Eljay2602 Not lying but it wouldn’t convince you. My staff taking time off to go to a funeral wouldn’t convince you. My positive test wouldn’t convince you. My list of vaccines is a mile longer than yours I guarantee it. Have you have covid?
1336299541780426754	"@DRMartinLLC Nope. My ""reservations"" are not ""reservations,"" but a simple acknowledgment of fairness. It would not be fair for me to get the #COVID19 vaccine before frontline healthcare workers in the ER, ICUs, and COVID wards who are at much higher risk than I am."
1461118236410449925	@NyrsaLyn I tested COVID positive!
1545135637954797570	@KMOoceanGIRL I too have Covid and have been sick for 10 days now. I again tested positive yesterday. The past few days I felt like I’d been ran over by a bus. I don’t qualify to get the meds to help with the symptoms. Canada doesn’t have a good supply.
1543317048394235905	I finally tested positive for covid today. I am not going to write motivational psychobable. Suffice to say in my experience it is like a massive allergy attack crossed with shingles. 1* review on VirusAdvisor, do not recommend. I have had 3 days of this. Yes I am miserable.

1549668217739948033	@HoldsworthCJ @BlackGoo_ @michaelryan756 The fact that more than 900 people in #Victoria are in hospital with #Covid causes massive issues with infection control. I mean that’s obvious, isn’t it?

1469914968938188801	@HamonSpot I can give you that.2% of unvaccinated die.Unvaccinated are 11 times more likely to be hospitalized.2.9% of vaccinated contract Covid.Of that 2.9%, .8% die.So 2 in 100 unvaccinated die.1 in 5,000 vaccinated die.Booster cuts the vaccinated numbers by 75%Word.
1515579954846703616	@houndfuse I basically got covid on 25 oct (or night before), tested negative on 27 and then tested positive on 29. Crazy 🙃
1470526855275032585	My FIL died in an ER several months ago. He was savable when rolled into ER. He died because the ER staff was overwhelmed at the time with unvaccinated Covid patients, and the attending physician basically made a mistake. If everyone was vaxxed, his life would have been saved.

1386837348277645313	@BarnettforAZ @BasementArmory Actually, fun story.  So I got COVID before the mask mandate, &amp; was mostly asymptomatic. When I went in for surgery due to the blood clot/endocarditis, they tested and I was positive.I had them test again, and I was still shedding the virus, but not sick. Still have antibodies.
1473527250809233408	@NYTScience If I was to be diagnosed with Covid, could I please change to something less stigmatizing, like maybe common cold? It would be such great mental relief, you know! 👆A dangerous game of nonsense is dismantling the core tissue of western societies
1376615227568033796	Correction. He tested covid positive the same week a year ago. I guess that's why I didn't hear about the irony of him getting it right after challenging Fauci. Regardless, he had ita year ago and he's still spreading misinformation.
1429920791651569670	@DCGreenZone1 Is that a form of vit D?If someone with a high level of vitamin D caugjt covid and was hospitalized, would they still benefit from it? My level was 60 last May, hoping it is even higher now.
1433312975243419651	Am I reading this right- latest Covid rules say under 18s no longer have to isolate if someone in their household has positive Covid test? If one child has covid, their sibling supposed to go back to school?! https://t.co/cbDckfQUxU

1444419420152020992	@paulalund14 @JuliaHB1 I know.  The US Senate are using UK and Israeli numbers yet the UK government isn't.  Further, British citizens are not paying attention to this.  If &gt;60% of hospitalized covid patients have been double jabbed, this surely undermines the interest in a vaxpass.

1481649465844854790	Someone tested positive for Covid in my office. We are really supposed to be working from home but for some reason everybody and they mama in here today. Just ignoring tf out the Covid policy that was put in place to avoid others from getting sick.
1440500226528210950	@thegreenmurphy I hope not. Not sure what our politicians were thinking when they decided to terrorise Australians into submission using COVID. Just a reminder. Only 1178 COVID related deaths over 2 yrs in a population of 24 million. Only 300 COVID patients currently in ICU. What the fuck?
1293665115657646080	@BobHS @DeborahMeaden Up to 28,000 die per year from Flu, even with a vaccine, and there are virtually no COVID patients being treated in hospitals at this time, none in ICU, according to my NHS doctor buddy. MOT guy might be wise?!
1472337087093379073	The #NFL new #COVID19 rules reminds me of #Trump’s “if you test less you’ll get less positive results” philosophy.

1523519474678173697	@takeoutphoto Oh hey! I had Covid in Paris last month. If you get tested at a pharmacy, you should be in the system and then 10 days after your positive test you're considered recovered. Any doctor will write you a certificate of recovery (assuming you feel well); you can fly home with that.
1521662929820549120	juz got positive in this COVID test so I’m juz counting my days left on earth
1374035231833944065	@AnnikaPires @DavidPember @lavern_spicer @POTUS And spring breakers are not going to get hospitalized from this. I also work in a hospital and have been around covid from day 1. Old people with multiple comorbidities are at risk. That's basically it.

1544679568325447682	@_ashawndabney Me! I got both vaxes, 1st booster, (2nd booster in June). Once I had mild flu~like symptoms! If I ever had COVID I never tested positive, even when my roommate got it in June. During Pandemic, I worked with the public in 2 states (Georgia &amp; California). I’m lucky and blessed!
1474711499134410752	"@AdamBOMBA5 @Justin_Reid24 I hope you read the article:""Doctors in the region all said that a substantial majority of the patients currently hospitalized with covid — between 60 percent and 80 percent — were unvaccinated."""
1476540200109154304	I want to see data on COVID fatality rates, given hospitalization.Have the hospitalized died at a constant rate? Have hospitalizations become more mild as this pandemic goes on? How many hospitalizations can be deemed “unnecessary”?
1480517941372526592	But 1 thing I've learned from it was satisfying. I've learned that sometimes it was only you, yes yourself can make things possible. Then 1 week after, I tested positive at COVID19 and recovered for 14 days.

1380743252899373056	@marcgoldstein_ My husband was hospitalized 8 days w/COVID., after isolating for 8 days as he was the only one who tested positive. He was isolated the 1st night home because he didn’t have test results-17 days since we’d touched. And we are blessed he survived. This image crushes my soul.
1418957090706673677	@DWMadil @BmoreBaker42 @eb4prez And I said with the vax there’s a 99% chance you won’t be hospitalized and die from Covid. Do you agree?
1444018008670838788	@Teek_76 @SuzeQKnits That all makes sense. I was imagining someone being vented due to COVID or just having COVID in the hospital in general. But there are other things besides COVID which I feel like we have forgotten.
1438161711371063296	@SamHarp65562239 @TheRadioTFI I'm not sure what's more sad. The fact you think covid is a death sentence or a immediate trip to the hospital or that you don't know the majority of people that are put in the death counter died with covid in them not from it. This propaganda is hilariously fear driven.
1357498321862991872	@BillRiceJr @AlexBerenson That makes sense. I know from reading the vaccine trials that a Covid diagnosis required BOTH a positive test AND clinical symptoms to be considered “sick”.  Otherwise the candidate didn’t have Covid.

1439574404959293440	@pookhahare Oh I agree. The entire system is a joke. Another piece I was reading last week talked about the number of covid deaths that didn’t even contract covid until they were in the hospital. I certainly don’t mean to minimize, just expressing frustration with the misleading numbers.
1425580724153987073	@StevieNicks Well I see Lyndsay has a tour going. Covid-19 isn’t likely to get any better as long as people refuse to get vaccinated. Personally I think there’s several fraidy cats of a needle stick. FYI if you’re hospitalized it’s going to be pretty bad on a ventilator and for months after.
1435349172866232322	The results have already arrived and they told me that I tested positive for COVID fuck ... it seems like a nightmare, I hope this disease does not complicate me more and I'm sorry if it takes a little longer to make the drawings :c

1466974036634832897	@Longbowgun @MartinLarouch17 @StaffanRydin @DrEliDavid I stated how many vaccinated people have gotten, been hospitalized and died from/with Covid the last 4 weeks. Your statement that almost none was wrong, and my statement putting all around 40% was right. Is your programmed brain denying this?
1389957545457078279	Like many others, she had delayed seeing a doctor. She feared contracting COVID and worried she'd lose much-needed income if she took off work. When the pain was unbearable, she went to the ER. “I hope it’s just an infection,” she thought. She was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer.
1376933322404814856	@dfromthebx @DrTomFrieden @Biaggi4NY How bad was your case though? Did you have to go to the hospital? I don't know of any covid hospitalizations of vaccinated people.

1443246322946134017	@KEEMsofamous one of my employees tested positive for Covid today 🌚 so since I’ll be home for the next 5 days I’m about to go rewatch Cheetah 🐆 Girls for you.
1422513715967107083	Some may know I had a spell in hospital with COVID last month, but that hasn’t dampened my determination to do a charity ride for @RideHighMK on the 15th August (just a week away!!).So if you feel you can spare some money please sponsor me - https://t.co/bmLfwLt1U6
1485453032913793033	I just recovered from covid and that shit sucks. I still cant taste my fav ramyeon and even when i eat, i cant taste it. Eric gonna suffer if his covid was as bad as mine because when i was first diagnosed it said “STRONG COVID” 😭😭😭
1470359149078843400	@tomhfh I was diagnosed w/stage3 cervical cancer in July. In Aug I was hospitalised after my tumour ruptured resulting in me bleeding solidly for 90mins, requiring blood transfusions in hospital. Caught covid in hospital. Unvaxed. No taste or smell. Still standing. Get some perspective
1379556732779831297	@79jmichael @AP Now is OK. Forever for me is NOT. This is how I feel about it. &amp; YES I tested positive for COVID. Went thru it and would NOT want to go thru it again. With that being said. I AM NOT WILLING TO LIVE MY LIVFE THRU A MASK!
1334040822879301634	@GoldensPaws I’m afraid when it comes to health care, we are not the greatest. Yes I am and will be forever grateful for what the nurses are doing for me as I sit in here in hospital. goodness knows what the costs will be at the end. as I write this the UK are first to approve a COVID vaccine
1380509431448866818	Someone tested positive for COVID in my immediate work area, so the next week+ I’m entirely working from home 😌
1488548323636256769	@andrewbaisden I’m double vaccinated too but my covid test was positive and this virus is horrible((!😒

1460694020901023747	i tested positive for covid 19😭
1502112241512071179	@labmom22 @HoltgraveHealth I have zero confidence in that number. At 1/31/2022 78 million Americans had tested positive for Covid. Blood tests of 70,000 samples by the CDC revealed 140 million had actually been infected so I adjusted the 6 to 13.2.
1431941619457138694	On my way to get tested for Corona since three people in my new uni class have tested positive. Really hoping it’s negative, as I REALLY don’t want to do online classes in uni again 🤞
1384983090351656962	@EricTopol @NEJM Hi Eric, Can you help me understand this...I had the J&amp;J vaccine on April 10. Felt sick (flu like) April 18th and tested positive (Abbott rapid test) April 19th. Bummer!!! Boyfriend also tested positive on 19th. Could I have gotten COVID from the vaccine then given to boyfriend?

1429568581323300865	@GovRonDeSantis I just don't get it. You have been seen all over the place except your constituents. Why not go and visit your constituents in the hospital with covid. You are such a loser!
1478131543604445185	Just tested positive for covid, 2023 will definitely be my year
1481594624007356423	Never in these 2 years have I had to take a Covid test……until today 🙄. Got a text a few days ago that someone I was around briefly tested positive. How bad is this about to hurt??? 🥴🥴.
1429243763445178368	@CarolinaNYC69 No you can believe in anything and have the freedom on anything go ahead. My thing is when you are going to the hospital bc of covid then why go. You don’t believe in medicine of this.  yes there are some meds I might not believe but I can say it not a pandemic bc of those meds.
1383017987565879307	y'all me and all the others in my fam has tested positive for covid ok bye
1358041154047119362	@kristiejo2323 @rwh11806 I wasn't going to get the vaccine but covid put me in the hospital twice so I better do it.🙄
1476786805865385986	On top of everything else today, I tested positive for covid. Thankfully I don't have any symptoms but still sucks https://t.co/AWGnf2Q328
1454156613770780681	@annettejals More children will die of myocarditis from the vaccine than would die of COVID. Healthy children probably had COVID and were not aware. I know of several who tested positive two weeks in a row and never had so much a ever.
1385361869955756036	Apparently don’t leave work two hours early with a headache (which I get a lot and I am diagnosed with migraines, have been since I was 4). Now I have to go get tested for covid and can’t return to work until it comes back. Im so annoyed.
1543340316954046464	I'm on day 26 of heavy persistent cough that's been around since my COVID positive test on June 7th.There's no end in sight.I'm relatively okay, and I know I could be far worse off, but I'm still somewhat salty.Especially when this was caused by an unmasked person.
1481281949910315016	As per the covid test conducted over major cities ..it was found that positivity rate is around 25%. That means among me, @narendramodi , @RahulGandhi and @varungrover one could be positive. Well my reports are negative. 🙂👍#COVID19 #CovidTesting

1572973716639993856	@nofingwaytaken @JeremySchuler2 @wowinteresting8 I was hospitalized with myocarditis last summer from strep throat. I wasn’t vaccinated nor did I have Covid at any time before then. I had many meetings with my cardiologist and I.D doctor about it over the past year. This is where I’ve got my knowledge on the topic from
1472784400135819265	@jolenecongress CA already next. Researching it now. Read an article a few of months ago saying that Shasta County (Redding) was commissioned to start building an internment camp for Covid positive tested citizens. Something similar to what is in place in Australia right now. I'll let you know.

1380212748806549505	@IdaIvey1 @cole_davesc66 @DrTomFrieden Just got my second modera ! Sore arm tired not hungry ! But that’s all! I would trade it anyway for not going to er with Covid!
1425856722883727360	@SimonCalder hi, I’m flying to Malaga Spain on Sunday AM and have done a pcr test today to get my results back in time. I had covid 3 wks ago what happens if it’s come back with a false positive? 😟 Spain are telling us to get pcr to fly to Spain.
1512481827470159873	My triple vaxxed and fit in-law is in the hospital with pneumonia from what seems like a COVID infection after days of spiking fever. This variant is no joke.
1572263512809824259	@maggiewillrise @DustinDuCane I’m a quadruple vaxxed and just got a positive Covid diagnosis (Poland). Not to scare you, but if you have a fever you should take a test! I don’t know what the situation is in Ukraine, but here cases are up.
1474041698170941446	As bad as it sounds, considering Omicron, I’m thrilled to see the incredible rate at which new infections are being diagnosed.  It will 1) further demonstrate efficacy of vaccines and 2) accelerate the rate at which COVID 19’s impacts to society will be so impactful. $CLOV
1471671135771275269	My entire abdomen is displaced pain and discomfort. I really hope I am not going to end up in the hospital tonight. And no, it's not covid.

1395938860786495488	@robbystarbuck Like I said Robby, are they going to try to force me to vaccinate when I spend 6 days hospitalized from Covid? Supposedly I'll carry the antibodies for up to 5 years from what I've been told.
1344164049106464768	@mazzenilsson If I am reading this correctly, someone under 20 is about 3x more likely to get an adverse effect from the vaccine than to get hospitalized by covid? That cant be right
1438657757431828482	"""I stand with Nicki"" It's a big joke to the vaccinated, until THEY start dropping like flies...when they are on HIV drugs because their immune systems are shot.  Laugh hard...while you still can! BTW less than 5% of people who catch covid go to hospital, it sucks but manageable."
1476659063614230535	@AP I tested positive for Covid-19 a second time back over 3 months ago. I had caught it the first time last year, and got the Pfizer vaccine in February. The PCR test we do at work detected it, but both times the rapid tests failed to do so. They can be a bit misleading tbh.
1432408300134535174	I get too much schadenfreude from the instant juxtaposition of someone who is anti vax telling people vaccines are bs, then seeing they’re hospitalized with covid. Like. Talk about immediate consequences of your own actions.
1393416414686441477	@Jessicam6946 I think the CDC made a statement too prematurely… They should’ve waited at least until after the summer to really see how this vaccination really works; Bill Maher was already officially vaccinated and he tested positive for Covid.
1442893330640035852	I ain’t been sick in almost 3 years and I haven’t stepped foot in a doctors office. I been my own doctor and I never had a positive covid test. Everybody don’t have the daily discipline to be responsible for their own health. That’s why big pharma is practically printing money
1376966869521948673	@DawsonNed2 @SportsCenter When a college athlete ends up in the hospital with Covid let us know. In the meantime we’ll all watch these healthy kids do what they do best. Also, ur cap locks r on. I assume that u know only dickheads do that, so I wanted to warn u.
1412007765170692098	If I go to the pub and get a bit too close to someone who is absolutely caked in covid and take a test I'm still gonna test positive. But as I've had one dose it'd probably just give me a bit of a cold.
1485260959144767488	I just tested positive for #COVID19AB, time to go jump off a cliff and have them add me to the covid deathtoll statistic. #COVID #COVID19Vic #COVID19nsw
1449750014604029954	@boundinthought @GidMK You’re right. I should’ve said something like, “If you’re relying on IVM to save you AFTER you’re infected, you’re gambling. Yes, you probably recover, but you may also end up in the hospital. Or dead. Given there’s no proof IVM helps w/Covid, the better bet is to get vaccinated”
1589626289102938112	@johnrich I have several comorbidities, unvaccinated and have not been sick since March 2020 with a 24 hour cold. Quit getting flue shots 15 years ago and my bodies natural immunity has kept me well. I am pretty sure a COVID vaccination would have put me in the hospital.
1550688213815238656	I finally tested positive for Covid. Sigh

1570511460425699330	@hon_iam @Ami61495883 @baseballcrank I bet none of the haters noticed that not one of them tested positive for Covid either.
1433969148707618819	I want everyone to know… my wife thought she had Covid in March 2020- she just got her 3 month antibody test and after 18 months she still has natural immunity… I also tested positive for antibodies and I had Covid the first week of June-15 months for me
1421251005820375040	I have sent msgs to Left wing Media Stop reporting Fake news about Covid cases like @680NEWS telling people yesterday 100 people tested positive &amp; giving you BS % as 1%.

1446546518383775744	@burgie75 I didn’t suggest anything of the sort that people with severe Covid shouldn’t seek treatment or that they should be turned away. What I said was the % of people with severe Covid in ICU is vastly higher in unvaxxed.  The science of modern medicine works…
1376967607077765121	@thomaskaine5 I already am. I am now fully immune (2 weeks past 2nd Moderna shot). I'm no longer concerned for myself. I know that COVID will not put me in the ER. I want to make sure that, if I do contract COVID &amp; I am asymptomatic, I'm not transmitting the virus to others.
1375190849861132289	I started feeling congested like 3 days ago and thought it was just allergies. I decided to go do a covid test...it came back positive. Fast forward to rn I can’t taste anything, super lethargic, congested and coughing plus a crazy headache😢
1514737540401561612	@kinreb @DrJacobsRad I've noticed that most of them are family docs who deal very little with the hospital system and acute cases of COVID requiring hospitalization. Meanwhile they refuse to see any of their patients with viral URTI symptoms and these patients end up going to the ER to get treated.
1387709729200349186	@paiges_502 @darylfoust4 Holy shit. So for your comfort, those 5-6% who still get it with already having the vaccine should just spread it around? Btw, I got my first shot, then went and got my second shot and tested positive for covid. My wife got the J&amp;J shot in early March and tested positive for...

1402443940318568450	Guys there’s people, a decent amount of them I might add, that are sick in the hospital right now from getting COVID after their vaccines. Some of which are on life support in the ICU. Just saying, weigh the risks before you get it.
1517552138477608963	@IUBWORKS I ended up getting Covid shortly after I got my booster. :( It kicked my ass, but I'm so glad I got the vaccine. I legitimately would have been hospitalized without it. If you'd like any ideas for what helped me and might make you feel a little less crappy, hmu. Feel better soon!
1521164479702126594	@MozPerkins Hoping it’s just the common yucky cold. For whatever it’s worth, I tested positive for Covid on the 4th day after my husband was diagnosed. Felt crappy. In any case, I hope you feel better.
1482828177731100672	@Fiona_M_Russell Why? Because ill informed alarmists like Dan Andrews has been preaching for 2 years now that if you get COVID you’ll end up in hospital…Proof me wrong!

1417977200343764994	@Fox_Claire What evidence? The evidence tells us that this virus does no harm to the young. The evidence tells us that this virus can be caught &amp; passed on by those who have been double jabbed. In fact ALL the people I know who have recently tested positive for Covid were all double jabbed.
1526046357768773633	@drlucymcbride Were you my treating physician when I ended up in the critical care unit with COVID as a “healthy” 37yo, because, surprise, I had cancer I had no idea about that would only be diagnosed months later? No, so shut the fuck up about this!
1387161892624416774	Im a previously healthy 23 year old. I was diagnosed with COVID on January 12. I still get a headache EVERY SINGLE DAY @ 6ish pm. Sometimes its more of a tension headache, others a full blown migraine. The vaccine is my only hope at getting rid of this. My first dose is Thursday.

1377263006007054341	Them: We’re closing our business because an employee tested positive for COVID.Me: The recovery rate is 99.7%.Them: Insensitive troll! Hate has no home here!👆🏻Real.
1425130156943822851	@Eightysix_45 @BenjySarlin @KevinMKruse I get where you are coming from. What is breaking my heart are the people who are immune compromised sick and dying because of others.

1503519332009009155	@Brikrln321 @pcdebol @CarmineSabia Had Covid. Not vax. Am not dead. Nor did I go to hospital. Was back to work in 5 days.

1333099056722305027	@AliVelshi I must admit, I am leery of taking Version 1 of any FDA approved COVID vaccine. I've been in the hospital too much in 2020 already. I am not an anti-vaxxer, just a concerned immuno-suppressed American.
1471972552151023622	@Bad_Chilly_ Also, wouldn’t it be incredibly difficult to track “how someone was infected?”  If I got Covid, go to the hospital because I can’t breath…imagine the amount of people I came into contact with.

1337436742987771907	I know this is false, i had the vaccine when i worked in the ER that year nothing even needed created like covid
1476002760487317504	Just tested positive for Covid and the flu together,, the 4th time I’ve been sick in 2 months, missing so much work too. Can’t catch a break, what gives ?
1477664995500597259	@SammualM @staysure Are you sure with that. I tested positive for COVID last week in the US so am self isolating and had to cancel my return flight. Waiting to rebook but @staysure has informed me that my flight expenses will not be covered…
1475871536678641675	@keira_connolly1 It does crack me up the lack of seriousness off this tweets on the virus. Well done let's hope your ignorance towards this doesn't lead into a hospita, either covid or something else. 3 quarters of covid cases in hospital are not vaxxed. at least been an upsurge in first jabs
1380313816156708864	@CassyWearsHeels I had COVID in March, 2020. Only symptom was loss of taste and smell. Out of curiosity had an antibody test in August that was positive.
1422646967184809987	@Alt_Azn @ChristinaPushaw @PressSec A third of all COVID cases are currently coming from Florida and Texas. I think people just want others to take this seriously. Florida banning masks in schools and having more kids hospitalized than anywhere else, is a very dumb, short sighted look.https://t.co/lRhqm0K4b2
1506435719987752960	i tested positive for covid19 😔 https://t.co/oohffyil0x
1449798847912456197	@LloydAMelville So I’m pretty much better now. Slight chesty cough and runny nose but it’s pretty much stopped. You think it’ll still test positive if it was COVID?
1553254225337253889	wtf…. I tested positive for covid https://t.co/GYjHb3HvRe
1399757910100566018	I just wish these folks would take the free damned shot, so we aren't overloaded with expensive ICU patients, that won't/can't pay the bills.............Anti-vaxxer hospitalized with COVID-19 after claiming vaccine would 'wipe out a lot of stupid people' https://t.co/M5SyoTcchM
1380061354514505729	Been feeling a little sick this week, so I got a Covid test, I just received a positive result. Literally at the finish line, my first Covid vaccine shot was scheduled for tomorrow. Thankfully my partner’s test came back negative and he’ll get his shot tomorrow. And away we go!

1487262435966787585	@pancakewoo yaaaaa i read the comments everyone was saying get well soon suwabe-san then i google the news and he was recently diagnosed w covid!! hopefully just v mild symptoms and he can recover fast!!hope ur exam went well!!
1389222685792681990	I've been on chemo. Declined the protein spike agent. Transported in the same vehicles as Covid patients back to OAP homes. I wear a mask in hospital, nowhere else &amp; dare anyone challenge me! Focus on your own risk assessment/ precautions.
1453294879266725899	@AwakeNotAwoken I have a 12 an 13 yo and both are dead against it, I haven't had it but the wife has.We all caught covid off the wife who caught it her mum who caught it in hospital, both double jabbed
1377317122540376066	@EBMgoneWILD I had an influenza and covid positive pt. Reminded me of the good old days when influenza positive meant we didn't even test for covid.
1604424448949760000	@has_many_books It was no big thing. Visited village doctor, he did an ECG and told KG to drive me straight to hospital as I might have a covid induced pulmonary embolism. I soon returned home with a stabilised heart rate and reduced clot levels in blood.
1476934590631710739	Am I just gonna test positive for covid forever? Cause if so I’m leaving my house. Fuck this. I’m not even sick in any way shape or form and haven’t been for days.
1313548537003757570	I personally feel like this “Vaccine” is a way to control the population. IT IS BULLSHIT. How trump get covid and was only hospitalized for 3 days to get this so called vaccine, now he feeling “20 years younger”.
1434342533899771905	I just woke up and opening my twt account then read a news that niki is also diagnosed a covid 19 😭😭 what happened?? Get well soon boys 😭🙏 sunoo please take care of yourself please~ 🙏🙏 @ENHYPEN_members @ENHYPEN
1483860737919356928	@albertanbeech One heart attack, lead to surgery, on meds for life can’t work. Many large rashes (all resolved)Many feeling like they were sick for multiple days after (resolved)And to top it off, since the shots came out, only those injected have tested positive for covid in my circle.
1440529549888946184	@DawnLaurier @SteamboatUSA I keep thinking if this was happening when I was 18/19 and constantly in the hospital and getting to 99% inflamed how I could die not even from contracting covid but just because there was no hospital space.And then also getting covid.We all have enough to worry about!
1377328755392282635	@JamesMelville 100% agree. I bought a private antibody test and tested positive for antibodies. I had Covid in March 2020. So I won’t have the vaccine as I don’t need it, my immune system has got my back 🤜🏻
1449817889528156163	@AnnaBeeBo Sorry you have to sell. I would hope taxis are following Covid rules and would be fairly safe to take if you need to go to hospital.
1485356993741213701	@amazon just decline my leave…after I uploaded my positive Covid test and vaccination card..🍅😡 https://t.co/K71SU6JfNa
1392991976405016578	@SkepticalMutant @erin_bsn Some were recovering gradually from Covid, but ended up in the hospital, after they got the vaccine. I think it was too much for their system.
1377259997105684482	After getting a COVID-19 vaccine, will I test positive for COVID-19 on a viral test?No. Neither the vaccines currently in use nor those in clinical trials in the U.S. can cause you to test positive on viral tests.​https://t.co/Wye5ebZP8s https://t.co/ktNZYcvEUT
1470420881545601026	So still no updated covid cases or positivity in MD. Hospitalization updated and a very scary breakdown shows 14 pediatric acute patients and 3 pediatric ICU patients. Most kids in hospital to date that I am aware of. Smh in some counties it is running rampant in schools.
1453406673637294081	@songbirdsings4 I've known people who have tested both positive &amp; negative after having COVID. I hope yours is one that becomes negative. Good luck
1376591759120203778	I am at Ryan’s isolated upstairs from him because yes, I somehow tested positive for covid. But the cute thing is that even though he’s right downstairs, he calls me and talks to me on the phone almost all day to keep my company 🥺💓
1460327758542917643	My job literally had one person test positive for Covid in the last month or so, but keep saying we have an outbreak 😑😑
1483581664987070466	Swear I'm having an allergic reaction to something and idk what to do. I'm not about to go to the ER so I can get covid on top of that. No thanks.
1481979579745062912	my flatmate just tested positive for covid 😟
1470092874448580613	I tested positive for covid 😐
1380292711803191301	@_V5M1000 He didn't have covid, part of the show, if so he didn't have it bad, in ICU for about 3 days? out in a week, my arse, all part of the script. People are  getting wise to the bollox now and more 1000's by the week, bring it on I say, won't be long until we all say to hell with it
1396838765608505347	Has anyone had Covid in the last 90 days, and then taken a PCR test before flying?PCRs can show positive within 90 days of infection, which might lead to the test preventing you from flying - falsely. There is no guidance I can see @askryanair @SimonCalder
1469335165096890377	@Fyodor34664866 @realBannanna @timspector Like I said, there is nothing about the people's age, comobidities etc. In South Africa it was claimed that many children were in the hospital with covid, but simply checking the source shows that covid positivity was incidental and they were under supervision only.

1428760731319681027	@EmpathStoner76 my husband who had a stroke spent 2 days in the ER hallway crowded, bright, noisy, limited care  bc  16 beds were taken up by unvaccinated covid pts..shouldnt it be the other way around ?
1434570128319033345	Saw a fan say they are done with the Cowboys because it's Jerry's fault Zack tested positive.  I blame Jerry for lots of things, but Covid isn't one.
1561448691252207618	My 16 year old just tested positive for covid. I have no experience with this, do I take her to the doctor for meds, or just keep her home until she's negative???
1481270474567045124	So how many are there? Yesterday I'm told there were 146 patients w/COVID just at TOH, w/14 in the ICU (9 requiring ventilators) along with another 3 in OHI, with 2 of those in the ICU. Also yesterday, Montfort reported 44 patients with COVID, &amp; QCH reported 75, with 4 in the ICU https://t.co/6Fls8AYCsg
1478474017258582025	@maestro_hell @SeffroodBrandon @trentster @privileged_2017 @MarcusBlimi math must be challenging for you.Let’s say there are 100 people in the country…all exposed to Covid.  The unvaxxed would catch it and there would be 20% i. HospitalIf 80/100 people in the country are vaxxed , with a success rate of 95%, there should be only 4 in hospital
1585249792745406465	"@ValdesSue @gordonpreece @fringecannada @ABDanielleSmith We were all told the vaxx would help from overloading the med system by keeping us out of the hospital. Were you hospitalized? Hubby and I were ""gifted"" Covid recently, we are triple vaxxed and comp. No hospitals for us, so IMO, the vaccine did what it was supposed to do."
1476737911437545474	I’m still shocked i tested positive for covid
1392895013244243975	@brownexceIlence Guess what?My main barber was diagnosed with corona, the one I went for a haircut was arrested by Police for violating the lockdown timings.
1476331231381884928	@pete316 What does it mean?  Genuine question.I’m assuming the red line on C is a positive covid test, what’s the other one? We don’t have them over here yet
1488634397276262401	"I'm sure a lot of people will be like ""oh phew, many people are getting covid *after* being admitted to the hospital"" as if it's a relief that people who were admitted to the hospital for other reasons now have to deal with a POTENTIALLY DEADLY VIRAL INFECTION on top of that"
1482191118049714177	@mikelangpr @MilkaUnmute If you're gonna assume that everyone hospitalized with Covid is there due to Covid, I will assume that everyone who dies after taking the Vax was killed by the Vax.
1418405622853165062	@ErrolWebber @WaroftheRosary Living in a red stately Dr gave it to me along with a space the minute I was diagnosed. I never had the respiratory problems. My Covid was gastrointestinal. Equally as miserable I assure you. But as a 63yo woman with 2 auto immune I got through it in about 2 weeks.

1478258583238103040	What brings you into the ER today?“I can’t breath” “my chest hurts”Did you get vaccinated against Covid? “No” ok well we are going to put an IV in you, draw some labs and a chest X-ray. If you can stay above 88% on 2 liters of O2 we will send you home. If not, admit. Repeat….
1488901901336780807	First day back to work after a break for being COVID19 positive(tested negative yesterday). I saw the snow and just wanted to put on basketball shorts again and not pants.
1384888276969050119	@djnontario I think he tested negative for covid but a staff member tested positive so he is in isolation (and he always gets paid when he doesn’t show up to work #PaidSickDays )Unless he’s re-tested today and got a positive result
1374022310005473288	@danjlevy I’m binge watching Schitts Creek while lying in bed with Covid. Got a positive test result today.😩
1377495685575114755	@allisonpearson @oflynnsocial Anecdotal reports of people advised not to go to hospital or get out as soon as possible as infectious so bad. My guess is vast majority of covid deaths in or caused by infection within an NHS hospital. Are there any official stats lurking about?
1483654750050844674	“Our thoughts are w/ those in hospital right now with COVID. And dare I say it, those who are in ICU or on ventilators as well. [literally the next sentence]Supply chains are under pressure as high levels of absenteeism go through the economy...” 🤦🏻‍♂️ #CallTheElectionDickhead

1374683800010162176	@putey_pute I only know of one old lady who got covid in hospital. Went in with Parkinson's complications (tested negative on admission) died 2 weeks later having tested positive for covid.
1466848699456307213	Welp, in the cruelest plot twist imaginable, it turns out the seasonal allergies I thought I had are actually the first symptoms of covid because I got a positive test result back this morning. So it's definitely for the best I didn't end up working with a bunch of kids today...
1383827995106766858	@sunlorrie @DrJacobsRad I was hospitalized with H1N1/pneumonia in 2009. Fortunately Tamiflu/antibiotics worked, and I was sent home after 24 hours. Low oxygen levels with high fever are scary. We need vaccines/treatments for Covid.
1435081987702751241	@Glenina57 Considering that there’s people who only test positive for Covid post mortem, I daresay there’s lots more in the community than is being captured in the data.
1428051010048516097	“I can pretty much guarantee we would have never met had you gotten vaccinated because you would have never been hospitalized. All of our COVID units are full and every single patient in them is unvaccinated. Numbers don’t lie. The vaccines work.”https://t.co/pqmqlwMuaT

1428060833830117391	Why is it so hard for me to report my 3 year olds active covid infection to the health department? The pediatrician said I had to report it. She tested positive on Sunday evening, and was at Hanna Park Sunday morning.@lennycurry

1426058119411638272	@JasmineForHD108 I'm in Camden County.  Fullt vaxxed lunch lady recently exposed to covid by being with her nephew who tested positive.  Was told by school admin not to test for 6 days, and keep coming in to work... no time off.
1502586752770486276	@Righteous1The @astaines @ISAGCOVID19 I’m against masks but I tested positive for covid in Jan and had no symptoms at all. I was fully boosted. Any of my unvaxxed pals had a flu like dose. Nothing that landed anyone in hospital but worse than me.
1351782088610086912	@NHSNottsCCG @SFHFT when is my gran who is 86 and has been in hospital under Newark+QMC for 8 weeks going to have the covid vaccine? Oh maybe it's too late now a social worker not even the hospital has just told us she has covid they said you aren't doing the vaccine in Newark hospital?
1488075337065971714	@LozzaFox Nah let them all die, who needs vulnerable people any way. I mean why should I have to wear a mask because of them. It was all fake , they should give themselves a shake and get on with it. There were absolutely no healthy people in hospital with covid. It was all a lie . 🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
1476609916144136197	@heyhalima We wish. Science table just said we are only capturing 1 out of 5 cases due to low testing capacity. So that means 14k is really 70k cases yesterday I personally know 10 people with covid positive through rapid test that are isolating and will never be reported.
1486021986526674950	Shutting down the daycare until Monday.Whether I test positive for Covid or not, I’m gonna be in a real financial bind next month.
1488226127579684868	@thetruthdivides @DJGryphyn @amber_warren Mathew, I'm not saying you can't get Covid, What I'm stating is that these ppl in Ottawa are saying freedoms are being taken away, I'm giving options. Vaccination reduces the effects of Covid, so you don't become a burden to the ICU.

1547974927088660483	I think conferences should be required to disclose (without names) how many people tested positive for covid right after the event, so those who are medically vulnerable are better informed about the risks they want to take just to do their jobs.
1385898848489328640	1 thing that I want to amplify is that pls get the vaccine when it’s your turn.The vaccine won’t prevent COVID,you might test positive even after getting vaccinated but you won’t have severe symptoms. U won’t have to get hospitalised,u won’t die.Don’t act like uneducated ch*ts.

1482475980463685636	@johnpavlovitz @Berlidge I need to go to the ER cuz I can't wait til Monday BUT I am terrified about it being full of Covid folks. 🤯
1555610603091382272	@intercepts1a @mibrd6 @RealAndyLeeShow The rules that won’t let the unvaccinated into the hospital to visit.If the vaccine really does reduce symptoms then you are the risk, if i get covid the science says I’ll be very sick, you could be a walking time bomb, carrying the disease with no symptoms 🧐
1603892659742916608	i just tested positive for covid and ive never had it before and i wear a mask in public and im honestly scared
1354332438009434114	@MichaelYeadon3 Three separate care homes I know are now testing positive for Covid following the vaccine. They were clear before that. Isn’t this just ramping up the case figures. Also if they die they’ll have had a positive test.
1508045245803790337	I tested positive for covid three weeks ago and I think I’m just coming right now. The spicy cough likes to linger!! 🌶 #COVID #triplevaccinated #lookafteryourselves

1473378858237841408	@JoseMoo79251060 @Matthewutt @OccupyDemocrats Some hospitalized people have tuen said okay I’m ready to be vaccinated. Then seem shocked and dismayed when they’re told it doesn’t work like that. You can’t get the vaccine and be cured of Covid.
1411049310037360640	I know two people that have the covid vaccine just diagnosed with covid.  Now they are on quarantine.  2 different households.
1443038060267155458	@rahrah77777 @thousand_tim @christina_bobb I will not agree because not even the experts are saying it STOPS covid. It reduces your chances of being hospitalized, but it doesn't STOP covid. That's my whole point!

1476606587087249418	@TakeMeBack777 @NikkiFried Remember vaccine is life protective.I would not want anyone to catch a bad covid and die in the hospital.In California unfortunately all i am seeing is all UNVACCINATED showing up with severe illness.  I dont wish that to anyone.Vaccinated still can spead so masking is needed
1482029961993093121	@VP At what cost is this $2k per month? Could we just get out @CAEDD4U, I’ve work throughout the pandemic and now with these Covid policies can’t go back to work bc someone in my household tested “positive” &amp; I tested “negative.” #JS
1478730087025446913	My Covid symptoms are almost gone on day 5; still slightly congested and fatigued and almost no cough or headache. Tried a test and I’m still positive. I would not have left quarantine if it had been negative but would have started to think about life after quarantine. 😷😢😁
1570528445754671104	@Tony_MacIntyre If people are going to continue to freak about about 19 people out of 350 dying having tested positive for COVID within 30 days of death, we should also publish age of death and health of those who passed. I think it’d help ease the paranoia.
1415752269673472000	@LozzaFox I dont understand how the young &amp; healthy are suddenly getting seriously sick with covid. During lockdowns they would of been more likely to be at work and mixing with more people so more likely to catch it. But its only now they are ending up in hospital
1381992635703816196	⭐ VACCINES WORK!!! ⭐My husband tested positive for #covid19 last week (the day before I was supposed to get my 2nd #Pfizer dose 🙄😭). Our house makes it impossible to completely isolate but with some distance, masks &amp; my one Pfizer dose I have remained covid NEGATIVE! 🙌

1473646749239717889	Don’t get the new covid isolation rules. If I test negative on day 6 &amp; 7 then I can come out of isolation but if positive then have to carry on for the 10 days but yet if you still test positive after 10 days you can still come out of isolation 🤷‍♀️  #Covid_19 #BorisJohnson

1611515435492458498	@WHO @mvankerkhove It seemed like putting people on ventilators didn’t work that well.  Maybe 6 more boosters per quarter will help. I tried the non-vax route and haven’t tested positive for covid yet but who knows 🤷‍♂️
1477657963992997890	@JaneLehr Seriously! And I know multiple people in SLO who tested positive over the holidays. The surge is on its way and will be worse because of Poly.

1375362747697872898	@apnoeaboy Hi David, this is so frustrating. Can I ask, if people are in hospital due to breaking Covid rules do they then receive a fine once back on their feet  and out of hospital?

1412052663626309646	@KeithMalinak And they probably were mislabeled covid deaths when they died WITH a positive covid test not FROM covid. I have a feeling that 386 number is closer to 0 than anything else.
1433923412959772676	I will not take a covid booster unless individuals that have been double vaccinated and had covid start showing up in hospital beds. I had covid, my body fought it off naturally, and I am double vaccinated. I don’t need a booster. @wolfblitzer
1465143870098870277	I love how people are complaining that their rights and freedoms are being taken away with the COVID restrictions. People, you do realise you would have less freedoms stuck in hospital trying to breathe on a ventilator or worse, you were dead from COVID? Take this seriously!!!
1421534214579757060	@piersmorgan Tested positive for Covid not long ago. I'm un-vaccinated, healthy lifestyle. I was bad for 2 days but still able to do household things, no taste, no smell, aches, feverish, cough etc. After those 2 days I was probably 90% better. Just the cough persisted for about 2 weeks.
1381429092336115714	Welp, guess I didnt slip under the radar and my covid scare I had before being vaxxed is turning into a full blown bout.Roomie just tested positive and with how im feeling, I guarantee ive got it too. Try to go get tested soon. Ugh. No wonder ive felt like shit

1424989498627272732	@jhnhellstrom @victorking888 The opposite of what I would have thought. Would have thought older had less. I wonder if a former not covid 19 infection is similar enough that the older people test positive?
1473447050096222209	@CBCFletch This just wreaks of more fear mongering from the CBC. I particularly like how he changes the benchmarking from deaths, to icu admissions, and now to cases. Most people with covid HAVE NO SYMPTOMS so instead all we hear now is about “cases”. Maybe cos we test anyone who sneezes?
1435979038288404486	@norcarl @Jeonsacc @LibrarianLore @duty2warn I have avoided so far but I know a few that were vaccinated did not manage to avoid the gurney.  I actually now know more people who were vaccinated who got sick, hospitalized and/or died from Covid than non vaccinated people.

1433449713508962315	Tested positive for covid this morning. Currently laid in bed feeling like total shit, listening to a bit of music and watching my cat having a dream.
1509152638465626112	@AAAopinion Wouldn't have even known I had Covid had it not been for the positive test. That was October 2020. Never had it since. Glad I didn't get the 💉
1446479878686052354	@richardursomd @TruthBegetsLife My husband and I started taking D3, C and zinc at the start of the second wave.

1373403272569032707	@UnitedAmyDoc It's most likely the opposite. I wonder how many of those covid idiots marching in London today will be in hospital in 2 weeks time. Sadly how many innocent people will they infect before them. 🤔😁

1465292354642972675	WELL UHI have tested Positive for COVID lmaoSo uh damnStrange tho cause I have not felt sick at all the past few days so I think I’ll be fine
1425510126748852224	@melissa123090 @dipablo_el @Jon1786 @ZubyMusic @AdamBaldwin The young and healthy already have near zero risk of getting hospitalized. By young I mean those 50 and below. Those older should probably take the vaccine due to higher risks associated with covid. Mass vaccination is actually more dangerous than helpful in many ways.
1584632767190482944	@boznjerz @DrEliDavid You probably had it. Most of us did. I travel regularly travel for work and have yet to test positive. 40%+ asymptomatic and testing doesn’t catch even more on top of that. You could’ve had “allergies” for a day or two or even like a mild headache that was really Covid.
1553544786283560963	@PeteUK7 @luvenice_h I'm in highly vulnerable groups &amp; told in May when I tested positive that I didn't need to bother with them. Not been offered any advice regarding long covid even though I have symptoms
1453148575614046210	@Plainjane2412 @KenMarsh8 @DeborahMeaden I see case levels dropping, must be everyone wearing masks? Aren’t a 3rd of all cases in hospital people who caught Covid in hospital? Hope you are all wearing those masks 👏👏

1510109728831062020	@Genogenius1 @habpipes Very true, it was same with me. When I was super sick it showed negative but while I was recovering the rapid test displayed positive. I had covid twice first one was brutal and second one milder, all thanks to vaccine.
1509818927617961984	Yowza.  8.5 days on from the moment the first person in our traveling group clearly came down with covid, I am the last man standing, with neither symptoms nor a positive test result.
1484829629449912321	Poland new record 40,876 cases, 3rd consecutive record. Covid patients in hospital continues in a slow decline from the Delta wave, -120 to 13,504, which is good but I suspect that will reverse middle of next week.

1508054453706199040	@richardodurrant @GVG1 I’d of walked by her (distanced of course) and said at the top of my voice “oh hi xxx I thought you tested positive for COVID the other day?, did I get that wrong?”
1478507876801032192	@DrLeanaWen IF you are vaccinated and boosted you get sick not die not hospitalized.  Covid will be around forever we cannot do remote school forever my god
1477150437367336961	Got my booster shot over a month ago and yet I’m welcoming 2022 in with a positive Covid test. Can we all just get vaccinated so these new variants stop developing #Omicron
1464580952290738184	I feel your pain, as a covid19 surviver no way I'm vaxxing. There should atleast be targeting people that are more likely to land in hospital, we fine. Even if shit hits the fan, never going to hospital cause people never come back alive.
1472238893294489601	Three more people who went to New York with my hubby just tested positive for covid. 😩
1443119159831932928	@Morcia You know I was thinking about this last night. People with ME will soon be diagnosed with long covid and long flu. There is no such thing as any illness that isn't covid 19 and this winter flu!

1544799289523798017	This is why I've made a point about the fact that I cannot risk going to the hospital right now. I have to be pretty sure that the risk is higher from whatever I need to go in for, than it would be if I got COVID.Almost nothing makes that list.
1524075548414287874	@dreamsofskies @listening_loud Also worth mentioning, last time I heard from my fairly young, previously healthy contractor, he was in the hospital with...drumroll... Covid19.

But we dont get the vaccine side effects being unvaxed.https://t.co/jTA9wzuE3Z

1603191630097678336	@TessPlease2010 I tested negative for 5 days with those symptoms. My wife had covid, I probably had the flu first and then caught Covid. I tested positive after being sick for a week.
1489575490306326531	Just tested positive for covid for the second time and I’m triple vaccinated. Nice
1372711270403612672	We are a year into the COVID pandemic.  I am sick &amp; tired of non-medical people making statements about ineffectiveness of masks, social distancing, &amp; vaccines. If I could, I'd invite you to visit patients in the ICU. There are still people being infected &amp; dying from this virus.
1437973702818344964	@JohnMSaboStory1 Got it thank you. My husband fell down the stairs landed on his back on the concrete basement floor. We went to hospital and it was so crowded with covid patients some were laying in the floor with blankets begging for help to breathe! Its a rural area thats the only ER! Thank u.
1359683834497949698	Surprisingly, I got Covid &amp; survived 🤷🏻‍♀️It sucked, but I wasn’t hospitalized. BUT my Dr’s are legitimately worried the vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction &amp; I’ve almost died from those before 😑I’ll pass. https://t.co/wTn9Bpc1mR
1444796588598116352	@unholy_E @ThiaBallerina I’m not making an argument. I’m telling you that I got covid last December, survived, and didn’t go to the ICU, without the vaccine. Covid is not a death/ICU sentence, as much as your religion requires it to be.
1435726096939560971	3 more kids tested positive at the Pottsville middle school for covid. From what I am told that is  27 people altogether
1501725260600672256	@KashPrime My question is: Would we even require restrictions and mandates if early (or ANY) treatments would be utilized? When I tested positive in September,my doctor pretty much said you have covid, good luck with not dying. As a nurse I was floored to have zero treatments offered.
1418987178198249487	@sfpelosi Had to go back to restaurants after GOP cut UI. The job averages $20 per shift in tips, and I’m homeless as a result. As I type, I’m in the ER waiting on Covid tests (I’m vaccinated). If +, I blame restaurants. Restaurants need unions or cease to exist. Exploitation at its worst.
1450364222056144897	@mawgooner @milknsugar2014 @mojos55 Oh yeah? So are the vaccinated. What do you say to that.  I personally know someone that is fully vaccinated and had covid that hospitalized him twice since getting vaccinated. The second time, they read him his rites and asked him about his will.
1422323411892719619	@LibBrockman This covid situation is a nightmare that ends in deaths. I know of someone that went to the hospital on the 13th of July and died on the 22nd of July. This is not a joke.

1426654810615566336	@Bootsielou88 I’m not disagreeing with you on what constitutes a healthy BMI or how to get there (coming from a guy who was 70lbs heavier). Not a doctor. Just citing a CDC study that showed that of the total number of patients in the ICU with severe Covid, 79% of them were overweight or obese.
1526914651354714113	It's a boy...and he has COVID. :-(I tested positive yesterday afternoon. Last night was pretty rough, but my fever broke this morning. Am going to take the day and just get rest.
1431303796383232009	@JeromeAdamsMD They explain why Texas border cities are overwhelmed while others are not. My area in Texas has low numbers. mathematically it can be possible bc vaccinated people are acquiring Covid and being hospitalized. Please do not use your position to sway opinion without detailed facts.
1469977753424470021	Waiting for a covid test result after being in contact with someone who tested positive is a harrowing experience. I begin get imaginary sour throat and fever 😂😂😂😂
1438195823175684096	@bette_oh That was my experience when I went in on a Friday evening and again on Sunday a couple months ago when I had Covid. No one in the waiting room, someone came and got me right away and put me in the ER room. I got taken care of immediately both times.
1398696773011525640	@LBunste @AndyJokedAgain @reynoldsgareth He also says he got the Covid shot, though he just tested positive a couple of weeks ago. Which doesn’t mean he DIDN’T get the vaccine, but I’m still a little “skeptical”

1443249314063659026	@RealBrysonGray The people I knew who have gotten the shot and got covid, ended up in the hospital and died. So telling people that the shot lessens the symptoms is not entirely true.
1377253207173259264	@johnrobertsFox @LisaMarieBoothe @CDCgov If that’s true, then why do people that have been vaccinated still test positive for the virus? Many people  get the vaccination go on to test positive for Covid, meaning they would be carrying the virus. I do not trust CDC. Until we can have open honest debates &amp; see ALL science
1521610384909680645	Hey all, sorry to say but I tested positive for covid...So, ASG will be canceled tomorrow, I appreciate your understanding. I'm looking forward to a speedy recovery and to see you all next week!

So 20,000 is the sample.Less convincing is whether covid still represents a high risk...i.e. is the still an emergency.

1394947704531210241	I know this whole ass family of 5, which, upon being infected from Corona started taking just Coronil, (no other med)After 25 days of infection, 1 has passed away. 1 is still in ICU and rest are have still not recovered fully. In an ideal country, Ramdev would be behind bars.
1386637188436303872	@hima_lakkaraju I travelled to India, all family members had covid, 2 of them hospitalized, 1 in the ICU for several days and then passed away. Waited hours for the cremation. Ground situation is worse. I have tried to keep up with academic deadlines, but am struggling. I hear you!
1378004095198490626	@sockmonster16 @v_gasm @PeterHotez we should all go to hospital for 4 days after catching Covid ? Had covid. My entire family had covid and no one was hospitalized. You do realize that this disease has a 99.73 percent recovery, right?
1470452848962027533	So my husband and I had Covid at the end of October, since then my husband has gone from bad to worse. Infection in ear led to infection of the facial nerve which has now led to Bell’s Palsy we think. Been in hospital all day for tests. Wear a mask.
1387777786278973450	@Jonnythealien2 I hope you feel better and don't have COVID.  I had a mild case, was in the hospital but I am much better now! https://t.co/Q455memsW4
1479721540203679747	@MiddleJulie @Real_JRoe @Publix My first sign of having covid was a sore throat. I tested when I woke up to the sore throat. Positive.
1476616811898707968	well i tested positive for covid https://t.co/eg5jP0vr9U
1510631187852763148	i CANNOT believe that i’ve been immune to covid since it started yet i just tested positive i’m gonna throw myself in front of a car
1481379258081726467	"@mamam00se @CityCynthia I don't know if they died FROM covid. Not sure how you know since their families explicitly said ""tested positive at the time"" and did not release further details.I find it terribly hypocritical that times more children dying of influenza did not move any of you..."
1508256874277134345	@POTUS @KJP46 And now another member of your staff tested positive for Covid @KJP46 because you all DON’T MASK!!!!!! I’m double vaxxed and boosted, but always wear my N95 unless I’m with my immediate family or out hiking away from others. Sure, she won’t go to the hospital but can feel like 💩
1578849561946206208	@froyswizz @andst7 Yeah but I had COVID-19 and ended up in the hospital with it with serious respiratory problems so I do know that it was serious because I experienced it for myself. But what the media did with covid was reprehensible
1473314799522127888	So you won't get vaccinated cos' you don't know whats in it. But if you get covid and go into hospital you will receive a cocktail of drugs including anti clotting drugs to prevent blood clots caused by covid and I would guess you haven't a clue whats in any of them get the jab!
1427784797485600772	@LiveFromLiz @MattWalshBlog I guess doctors just wear them for fashion. Do not go to the hospital if you get covid. https://t.co/yW5vkI1jil
1619337489814261761	@guyswife_cocos @crandle @JedediahBila Deborah, I am double jabbed, but spent a month in the hospital with a severe case of COVID, then a week in rehab, plus recovery at home. I then had to have COVID related heart surgery to correct severe myocarditis damage. That’s what has caused me to look deeply into this.
1467868730432577540	Well my worst nightmare came true my baby tested positive for covid last night. Keep her in your thoughts and send positive vibes she's doing good for the moment.
1428112418660667396	Still think masks don’t make a difference? Ever since we learned my 11 y/o was exposed to covid, we started wearing masks in the house (unless she was in her room). She tested positive but no one else did.
1468532456915623944	@ron_dickie @ClarkieThomson This is one of my issues with the jab(s). For older people/those with health conditions, it seems a good idea. I’m not that old and in good shape. I’m unlikely to end up in hospital and very unlikely to die from Covid. The jab(s) should be voluntary, and they obviously won’t be.
1526397374834233344	@SSage69007180 YES!Before covid we went to ER and he was having high bp. There were 12 PA's and 1 DR and 9 patients. The PA's who were sitting around the desks talking, could not help him bc it was only a DR that could help!  I marched to HR and told them he was not getting help &amp; she was /1
1465112259370393604	@ScottAdamsSays Children have a higher risk of developing myocarditis from the vaccine than being hospitalized with covid per the Israel study and cdc data. I’m willing to bet the cure is worse than the disease for all young ppl.
1395288584534466562	I am tested with COVID19 positive, I am recovering and I am confident that we will win this War against India under great leadership @narendramodi 🙏🙏🙏🙏@BBCBreaking @cnnbrk
1487621194656452610	I really hope my PC isn't diagnosed with COVID. Im worried for him 😰 https://t.co/XK134xHuEN
1330149780127887361	@Jimak54 @MichaelYeadon3 As daily deaths are reported irrespective of actual cause but just needing a positive Covid test at some point. Will they also report daily deaths irrespective of cause but having had the vaccine. I would have thought equally justified
1384015960810557448	@Tifftopus What exactly does that even mean? It’s ok to admit you’re wrong without talking jesus crap about my heart. The #Covid test was positive and I’m a #LongCovid survivor because ignorant people like YOU politicize wearing a freaking mask.
1434242543257100290	Why do I keep seeing people who got vaccinated repetitively test positive for Covid and those unvaccinated still staying negative? https://t.co/VKaC1gb5LT
1465725639940444166	@Shake1n1bake @prdelong I know people are stressing about the vodka thing but I literally just blotted a paper towel and wiped them down like that, the way they were talking in the beginning it sounded like you could get covid that way. In the hospital they used to make it mandatory to…
1426170317181960199	@justryin2live My unvaccinated family was in the hospital w/Covid- but my vaccinated family said it felt like a cold- for a couple days- &amp;then, it just disappears:) NO WORRIES!!! You’ll be FINE- that’s why u got vaccinated;) 😘💘
1385606516275884035	@DevilArtemisX I just tested positive for COVID
1358128302267990021	@Mickey58630673 @TruthSp01978317 If you can show ANY evidence an untested and unlicensed vaccine is safe I would sympathize with you! Latest study says 80% of hospitalized patients with #COVID19 are deficient in Vit D. Why inject a cocktail when a simple vitamin would be far more effective?
1426666406905528321	@asymmetricalpha The only thing that kept me from going to the hospital was doing breathing exercises. Working on deep inhales and exhales to keep lung capacity. Keeps the Covid and the fluid from settling and reducing O2. Zero doctors, including mine are even talking about it. INSANE
1379391171412234248	@erbwa @supergooner45 @rec777777 @izcohar6 @BorisJohnson @BBCNews Oh the I’ve been in hospital and seen a non-Covid ward empty crap - ever thought they might not let general admissions nowhere near the Covid wards??
1582980791818018816	@WIRED I think we're all done with it.  Two different close branches in my close family tell me they don't believe in the vaccinations, both have had COVID, one was hospitalized &amp; she's in her 20s.  And they both don't believe the hype!  I have been vaxxed &amp; revaxxed 4x &amp; never had it.
1380965622075465730	@HawaiianAir My apologies My wife was hospitalized for over a month, we lost a member of our family to COVID, and I was really looking forward to this trip. 😞
1386349115005677568	@georgy7856 @sueperkins @emily_glenister The only two people I know who died with  Covid acquired it in hospital (there too long to be acquired elsewhere) or in their care home.  I know more people who have died because of Covid (e.g. cancelled cancer treatment, refused to attend hospital).
1419063264529448962	Pleaseeee. People I know would not go to the hospital any ways. Many of the people who died of covid had 1 major thing in common and it isn’t covid.ITS THAT THEY WENT TO A HOSPITAL.
1429631329868541955	There is a child at my kids’ daycare who tested positive for covid (and a daycare provider did as well). This is the first covid positive at the daycare. Ugh.
1339628686979584004	Dr. Ben Usatch has treated COVID patients at UCHealth nearly every day during the pandemic.Today he got his vaccine. He told me he was so excited he could hardly sleep last night.He got vaccinated, put his PPE back on and went back to the ER to help more COVID patients #9News https://t.co/jhHOZBslqV
1428212390521356288	I paid for my ride in the ambulance when I went to the hospital with covid and I am an asthmatic who wore my mask every day and have to pay for an oxygen converter as covid affected my lungs. But I didn't pay for the hospital stay of 6 days or the drugs that were pumped into me.
1355313705421049856	"Johnson &amp; Johnson's one-dose coronavirus vaccine a ""huge, huge win,"" one LI doctor says. Overall effectiveness is lower than the Pfizer &amp; Moderna vaccines, but none of those who got the J&amp;J vaccine were hospitalized or died. via @drhli &amp; me https://t.co/WQ7ot3z7EQ"
1432869202499706886	@ToniLaNae My boss got Jab then he got COVID months ago and ended up in the hospital with a blood clot last week  and his doctor tells him it’s common after having COVID like yeah ok I’m pretty sure it was the vakzeen
1476419038133854214	the cdc has announced that if you test positive for covid you must wash my back this once so then we can forget
1375154769925435397	@levantet_ @Lord_Sugar I don’t know what you’re saying.  An icky day after the second dose of vaccine beats the hell out of being hospitalized with Covid. https://t.co/DftNupxDrp
1446527720607739904	so i tested positive for covid, taking a real test and hoping it was a false positive. idk if I’m playing. sorry everyone.
1487027257420001280	@UanI_Play @btogeretz5 @cvand11 @argosaki UanI, please do some math.  Unvaccinated people are 20-30x more likely to end up in hospital &amp; no one said you couldn’t get Covid if you were vaccinated. Telling me to “shut up” only shows that you think only your view matters. And you didn’t answer - take Canada back from who?
1507298058014441475	@altme123 @HayleyB55135794 @mlchealth Apparently you're only contagious when you've a temperature. I don't have any papers/reviews that I know of to back up just some info I was given by a Dr treating covid patients. It's unlikely you would have been contagious. You can still test positive for up to 90 days after!
1570520278295539714	@D0CSHARTENS Listen I tested positive for Covid this morning so I’m claiming this as a sign
1480182737671708674	Can I get that COVID variant that you test positive for on LFT and PCR, have absolutely no symptoms, and get a paid week off work you get to enjoy as if nothing happened? I'd like one of them.
1543437527352320000	"@jakiraokami @Dematrix19K @bvst7dxxpk @rob_chancey @silencewedge I agree with you on your correction, but as someone who was hospitalized with Influenza B[the flu] as a previously ""healthy"" 22 year old....the flu can also really fucking suck &amp; be dangerous. tldr - Both COVID-19 &amp; Influenza have the capacity to kill harm ppl, but COVID &gt; Flu"
1390373052328841216	@RepTimRyan I know 4 people personally and 1 famous person who were fully vaccinated and a month later 3 of them are in the hospital with covid.
1426501147142012929	@HarrisonSmith85 Not sure how true it is, but I read that almost 10% of the people in attendance tested positive for covid.
1472278666063265793	@2s0u2c0ks @oldmanebro Not overwhelming, stop using one offs to represent the masses. I’ll bet the majority of young people hospitalized are obese, another leading factor in Covid deaths, 78% of people are obese that have died from Covid.
1373848001672835073	Lots of big weddings this weekend like we’re not in a pandemic. I don’t know why I still let it make me so sad. A perfectly healthy 47-yr-old Dearborn man died of covid last week after being in the hospital for 3 months. Everyone gave condolences then went to a wedding days later
1384705161084424196	Another person I know, pre-40 is right now struggling in the hospital with breathing problems and a COVID infection. We’ve prayed for them as God’s people should. Where is the one person I can help understand the importance of benefit vs. risk #mRNA #vaccine ? Do for one.
1445243917302042628	#IndiaFightsCorona:➡️ Doctor, I have tested positive for #COVID19, can I get vaccinated now❓❓❓✅ No Rajat, you should take the vaccine at least 3 months after recovery from COVID.#Unite2FightCorona #StaySafeStayHealthy https://t.co/NgiDvMDnOE
1345384532476907522	@LiviButt Hard to imagine anything more crass/thoughtless; exhausted staff would’ve seen this group, families of people in hospital also witnessed this; when will people realise how serious this virus is? We lost a family member to COVID in March, I want the vaccine, I want my family safe
1431792286904373253	@uche_blackstock I have a very similar experience. My 7 week old had a respiratory arrest in the paediatric ER after brought in due to indrawing and ^resps. 3 days in ICU and 3 wks on respiratory ward. All I can think of is these babies with Covid. Mine is 17 now so glad your kiddo is well!
1379884785942863872	My job is shut down tomorrow because two people tested positive for covid. Both people are FULLY VACCINATED. How does any of that make sense?!!
1476722648931577858	@AWokeZombie @justin_hart Why what is it a out the vaccine that gives people covid or has them test positive. I can only go by surrounding anecdotally and in the last month I know about 25 people who got covid and only 1 was unvaccinated.

1548117031081259011	@MKerklin Oh good. Yep, I think you’re good. I’ve been reading that the new variant is not always triggering a positive home test &amp; needs the PCR. You guys have enough to deal with. You don’t need COVID. I worry about you all &amp; just want you to be ok. 😀❤️
1510372786740604938	@BadMedicalTakes Well there are a bunch of types and subtypes but aphasia is a diagnosis.  I happened to be diagnosed with a form of Broca's Aphasia after I had lack of oxygen + chemo damage part of by brain. Guess they were covering up my uh... COVID 15 years ago? https://t.co/TOBKF46nXP
1525667435592011781	@sr_seymore @WShaneSchmidt @mbrodkorb @GovTimWalz @mngop @drscottjensen @MNSteveSimon Per the article you posted, only NY and CA told hospitals they could not discharge patients to nursing homes. They had to stay in the hospital, at risk of infections (&amp; covid). So…everyone but those two did what Walz did. But do go on. PS - I work in LTC. I’m guessing you don’t.
1373295450070130689	@beyutch_ @shandya @AlwsPotterhead Given the social media posts I’ve seen from people in the ICU with Covid and the fact I worked on Wall Street on 9/11, there’s no doubt in my mind we would have had airplane and Twin Tower tweets. And they would have been awful, followed by unanswered replies of “Are you OK?!”
1489422228903317505	My covid test for rtk positive but my pcr is negative, am i like a super zombie in all of us are dead right now. https://t.co/y7ZdVFv2ta
1619869041291661312	@VPrasadMDMPH I still don’t know anyone who has died of Covid, I know one person who was hospitalized with it and I don’t know anyone with long Covid. I do know of someone with a vax injury and ‘died suddenly’ has become increasingly common in our local obituaries.
1381415565252825088	My stepmom tested positive for Covid today. Please keep her in your prayers. She has a lot of health issues and isn’t in the best shape right now! #COVID19 #Michigan
1476284458533797892	oh hey positive covid test, I've been so lucky lately 😐
1486316823343738881	@GBNEWS As you still get covid with the vaccine. I can't see the point to the story. She is not in hospital is she????
1415348645638119428	I tested positive recently and, as historically asthmatic, I'm v lucky to be able to isolate easily and rest well with support from my employer. Consistent state support is required so clinically vulnerable people's safety from covid is not a matter of chance.
1372794981346283531	If the Democrats did steal the election, which I'm convinced they did, does that mean that BIDEN IS A BASTARD. Most people can't see it but Biden is trying to kill us. He let it be known that he would pen the borders &amp; he did now 50% of illegals tested for covid 19 are positive.
1417198202315542537	@scotty2404 Thats the main reason I had mine. Cos a knew it would come to this. Covid isn’t going away.  And they can’t lock down forever. Plus I couldnt risk been in Hospital if I got it bad,cos dog would be wounded if I was away lol
1604940932478017547	@behindthemall13 Not playing this just in case… I took a picture of my positive covid test and it could me the 10th picture….
1515009447298572297	@bcarolcox He was hospitalized for a week after our family doctor suggested taking him in for a chest x-ray. They needed beds in Peel, so they transferred him to Chatham-Kent on 20 minutes notice to us. I have a student in my math class that is still struggling with the affects of Covid.
1388897111832514560	@Brian49800559 @TinFoilAwards @mcfunny @swedishchf @naomirwolf Just getting infected isn't exactly a better option. For example, I was in the hospital for a week and lost about 25% of my kidney function after a viral infection. Not covid, but it could have been another coronavirus. Look it up. Acute Tubular Necrosis.
1478723392157138946	@PeterTharos I’m just meaning people coming in could be positive with Covid.They are saying testing isn’t needed, due to Omicron being less severe.But you wouldn’t know what variant someone has.You wouldn’t know if they have anything at all?So, just not test anyone then?
1381161642373705731	@SEKIRBAE I will update as soon as I know. He’s undergoing testing in the ER... normally I would not be so nervous, but his lack of medical hx, combined with the covid vaccine horror stories, has be especially nervous.
1537815088857591809	@SalzSez @_ashawndabney It is 2 years and 4 months (approx) since we started with this virus. I am aware of, people I know, now who have Covid, more than at any time in 2 years. Tested positive, no symptoms/ symptoms, but thankfully no hospitalizations. Yes its still here, be careful!
1433524402130456583	I think that everyone should be given a fair chance to get vaccinated and they can say yes or no.If someone says no and they wind up in the ICU with Covid, AND SOMEONE ELSE NEEDS THAT ICU BED, then I would expect that they are the ones who are moved from ICU to a normal bed.
1372601860914356225	COVID patient census down to low single digits at my hospital! Also a symptomatic family member trying to visit a patient in the BMT unit tested positive for influenza! Does this mean things are heading back to normal?? 😅
1486431644454207492	@stevie_twinks @RobGoffee True but only 16k in hospital.The vast majority of asthma sufferers aren’t.I have asthma and was fine when I got Covid.What’s the point in this? A few will get ill, they need to stay home it be treated. The vast majority will be fine and a huge number won’t know they even had it.

1325870839003312128	@Sportsworld716 I got COVID via my wife from her work at a school. One week in the hospital from lung problems. I hope this vaccine has some merit - it would be good to get past this soon for sure
1437634802635714562	@QueenNickiPetti @NICKIMINAJ I’m with Nicki. I’m gonna stand beside her. As a Covid tester, I see more people who are vaccinated test positive for Covid than the people who are unvaccinated.
1437506784525275136	@MamaBear_Truth I mean, why do Covid positive people go to the hospital unless they are very ill and need oxygen or critical care. There are many who have mild symptoms admitted for observation, even asymptomatic. There are those who are there unrelated to Covid then tested upon entry: counted+
1336780455232876544	I volunteer my husband to get the COVID vaccine ASAP even if he doesn’t want to so I can guarantee he can be with me in the hospital during me giving birth

And my head isnt up the msm’s ass so i have this strange thing where i can think for myself and come to my own conclusions
1525956876243832832	@bayareahausfrau I think your right 💯 I don’t think the high profile democrats or republicans really got the shot. I think they are faking positive Covid test for two reasons to promote fear and so that the ones that have there 4 or 5 shots and still getting sick don’t get suspicious 🤷JMO
1402498425946574848	Guess who has a slight cold and headache and close contact with a colleague who came to work symptomatic and tested positive 🙃 why dear lord. I’ve had COVID before and the vaccine (J&amp;J 🙄) but swabbing and self isolating just in case
1380296892723126275	Well, my good health finally ran out.  Just tested positive for Covid.  They also noted an irregular heartbeat, so if the EKG they just ran reflects such, they want me to go to the ER...
1617001804218396672	During Covid - like when masking was mandatory etc - no one I knew got Covid. Today - so many people i know have or have had it in the last month. It hasn’t gone anywhere - still here. I was in hospital just before Christmas with pneumonia - then got it twice after that. #wakeup
1470398507945189381	@sixfootfourman @JohnnyX1987 @RepSwalwell I personally know around 20 people that have had COVID. 0% of them died. 0% of them went to the hospital. And maybe 2 of them were vaccinated.
1416484840573181963	Can we just rename covid to bullshit. It sounds so much better.I tested positive for bullshitCases of bullshit are risingThe jab doesn't prevent the spread of bullshitI wear a mask to save other from bullshit😆 I made myself laugh
1520036379568140289	I contracted COVID earlier in the week (the cough is a shocker!) after husband tested positive last weekend. I did do my best to wear the good N95 mask but others often think those fabric ones are good enough. Apartment living means using a Lift!
1486852438984470534	@Christi33531685 @jenbrea The surgeries are brutal, and sometimes there are bad complications.  So just spend some time *researching* -- I recommend the FB group ME/CFS Brain + Spine.  Twiiter hashtag #mespine.  Search Twitter for the Long Covid pts who have been diagnosed with CCI already.
1574507355110133760	@notsomadboy I've been wondering if you had covid, I hope you don't. XIt may take a few days for the test to be positive, if it is.
1379192729842880518	@CLOD9 @OwenR82 @thefogmutters @DavidShepherd9 @JuliaHB1 Almost as bad as the “why do surgeons wear them?” Argument. I suspect it’s mostly because they are made to. Also, 40% or so of COVID deaths were of people who contracted it in hospital, so I suspect they didn’t actually work.
1516528563196940293	@JaneFallon I tested positive yesterday and Covid is kicking my ass. Massive headache, dizzy, no appetite, extreme body fatigue, runny nose and coughing up my insides.

1464783714513154051	I was at a local 125 bed hosp in ICU a week ago. The covid ICU wing was blocked off, as were the covid rooms on my wing. No visitors for covid pts, 1 per day for non-covid ICU. 2 per day non-covid wards. Staff all used phone or walkies to confer rather than f2f. It was quiet. 3/n
1399167525850472452	@DrPieterPeach @itosettiMD_MBA @beansprouts_mom @Fiona_M_Russell @CollignonPeter Having seen what has occurred elsewhere, I want my kids vaccinated before borders are opened widely. We are complacent here as well. To many kids in hospital overseas. To much long Covid to risk it. My personal opinion only, but that is what I would choose for my children.
1473684319164063755	Colleague tested positive for COVID today, so I’lol most likely spend Christmas alone at home. I know this winter is hard for everyone but right now it sucks really bad.
1488241602254540800	I mean, back in 2019 before we had COVID PTO, I was in the hospital for 18 days, 14 of those being work days, and had to start using vacation days to cover my PTO because I ran out sick days partway through the second hospital stay!

1380881598606884864	Not all people react to COVID like the patients in ICU.  I got the virus and felt miserable for about a week. Been fine since.  I’m sure a lot not all ICU COVID patients have underlying conditions.  Otherwise healthy people die of the flu every year too.
1613295687684263936	I did a Covid test randomly and it might be positive
1619514722960936960	@freethinker194 @TaraBull808 I think most ”Covid” deaths have been caused by attributing every death within 30 days or so of positive test or simply an ”opinion” to Covid. Secondly, many Covid patiens were denied proper treatment and they died due to medical errors. For ”vaccines”, the worst is just coming.
1478104065309618178	Y’all be careful out here. I just tested positive for Covid. I can’t even walk. Idk how im finna drive home. Ian never been in this much pain.

1597199113983885312	@Halleran_MD @RobertUnchained @Ponderingcorpo @stclairashley A Medicare patient yields a 20% premium to the hospital. That means a normal patient admitted yields X. But if listed as covid is 1.2X. Yes, its financially better to move past covid, but during the peak, most revenue is from everyone having it. All Im saying is thats incentive
1376486295967576066	@beyouonlybetter I know people who currently have tested positive. I don’t believe they have Covid though.
1355699404112465923	@jamiebgolden Amen. I've tested positive for COVID, and even though I don't need to be hospitalized, a mild case is NO JOKE. And I STILL can't get a vaccine, even though MD told me I could get re-infected.
1433083516175147017	@bekcat @shesinscrubs @carterforva Okay, sure, but that wasn’t my question. My question was, vaccinated or not, what is the treatment for covid once you catch it, here in the US? Seems like ppl go into hospital and just die, meaning the Drs didn’t help/treat their illness.

1442752083434737668	I'm not here to debate vaccine mandates. But I would like a valid reason why an unvaccinated person who catches Covid and needed to go to the hospital would go to a hospital to be treated by a doctor who would have advised them to take the vaccine.

1377015459372003334	@thebaldbeavers @Paddyteskey @TheBlueGem3 @globalnews Nah. I think we need a lockdown. 46 Ontarians with Covid admitted to hospital in last 24 hours.
1425441700575649797	@Emcee322 @jencurran Same!!! We had covid here...half my family tested positive the other negative..THIS is why we all wear masks...cause no one knows if or when you can spread it...
1507811409182314504	@chrischirp @Kit_Yates_Maths Got a text to invite my 5 yo for a vaccine! Not my ten yo yet, but progress! They say must be 12 weeks since Covid positive test - is there any evidence for this?
1443598083732955136	@OrdinaryGamers I got the vax . But covid isn’t as deadly as people say . They come clean to hyping up numbers . It’s less than 5 percent chance of getting it to go to hospital - not die - just get medical attention … odds are higher of being in a car wreck or dying from a car .
1405995712274481154	So I'm been threatened witha £1k fine if I don't self-isolate for 7 days after coming into 'close contact' with 1 random person on Sunday who has since tested positive for Covid but this is okay? 🥴 Good one.
1386002412205318150	Jose Altuve says he did test positive for COVID, but also said “I feel really good. All the way through it I feel really good.” https://t.co/rkDNVr7O7s
1408403339247771649	Someone it seems at a local gym tested positive for CoVID so even though I have tested negative I’m stuck at home in a fury at the Hancock/Johnson farrago. Why aren’t we screaming?
1399980037336670213	@AvitalLeibovich So happy to hear of the improvement.  But remember the unvaccinated are still vulnerable.  And you still have 27 in the ICU, and 97 hospitalized from Covid-19.  So you aren’t exactly “Corona free”.  But it could happen soon, I hope.
1559701967634587649	hey @pulte I could really use some help, recently went to the hospital for covid without insurance. turned out a lot more expensive than I thought it'd be. any support would be appreciated.
1595680391112925184	@catturd2 Remdezivir try to dismantle my kidneys when I was in the hospital with Covid for 14 days on that bullshit. Who can I sue thanks.
1461606724964687879	@Firesnapper999 @EmergMedDr Even the flu ends up with me in hospital with pneumonia and I'm 56. Scared to death of covid. 😪
1460546320620396548	@notmuchofahw Her last pregnancy, with twins, her resting heart rate generally sat around 150bpm. She spent three days in hospital, possibly due to a mini-stroke. She’s still struggling with her heart. This is not a woman who can risk COVID. I am so worried for her.
1448358262957481985	Turns out i was exposed to someone who tested positive for Covid🙃🙃 had to skip today to get tested😕 Will update what the status is https://t.co/fKWnWx9KGl
1415676650067533824	@sanbrunamo @AngryBlackLady And in terms of numbers, I'm seeing studies with 1% mortality rates, 10%+ long covid rates. The share of children hospitalized from covid is growing. In modern times we haven't had to deal with an illness this dangerous to children.
1381977201399238662	@carranzapz @GeorgeGammon No dumbass.  If u are not an expert...Stay quiet.  I have taken care of countless covid pts in icu over last year.  Antibodies argument is an explanation for your ignorance ...
1481972968704118786	Who they going to blame now that just about every triple vaxxed person I know has gotten Covid and spread it to others.How can any business justify mandates now?Shouldn't the just fire anyone with a positive test to keep the others safe? It's just a fucking sensible.
1422287755393044486	The vaccination will help u w the Covid, if I were u I would go to the hospital &amp; check yourself for cancer, heart &amp; lung condition, eventually all Reps will continue repeatedly having Covid/Delta since y’all decide to go against science &amp; make this political
1373652296706355202	@AmberSchmidtke @WalesFanForlife Additionally she had COVID and tested positive a few times and had survived. Which means she already had the antibodies and didn’t need the vaccine. Oh and I thought the standard protocol was to not give someone the vaccine if they had COVID in the last 6 months?
1339656366139600897	I believe the swabs for the covid-19 tests are giving you some of the genetic coding made @  lab r engineered DNA changing concoction they're trying to call a vaccine it is not that's why they need to get the swab n u &amp; make you test positive so don't take the test=control over u
1323081185883385858	"Aner Ottolenghi, one of the two Israelis who received the experimental coronavirus vaccine at Hadassah Hospital today, said ""I feels great, someone had to be the first to get it. If not me then who?"" He's staying in the hospital for 24 hours observation https://t.co/MNdXOvETIj https://t.co/2ptC0TX5Kj"
1550716557071773696	@ppeden4206 @bjoconnell13 @TheMikeSalk Maybe it’s a sore wrist?  No. No way. Probably a huge conspiracy to mask a positive Covid test. Did you see they went so far as to find a look alike to hang out in the dugout and pretend he was Julio? But you and me aren’t fooled right?
1354871752514527235	@DeanMcMackin The key thing with the vaccine is that is doesn’t stop you getting Covid. Just reduces your chance of dying or going to hospital. I think as a safety measure, teachers in secondary schools should get jabbed. But primary cases are so low, I think they should get them back now
1448954291134291969	@dwelsh1987 I'm just getting over covid, tested positive 3 weeks ago. Got it at the Palace game. My youngest lad was with me. He come down with that cold you've got. Was convinced it was covid. He never tested positive once, I did every day for 5 days. I'm over covid now he's still coughing
1509989193853845512	@danrosenbergnet They are not distinguishing in data between kids admitted because of Covid vs kids there for other things testing positive. They test all. Very important. My contact there says vast majority are already there with other issues and are largely without symptoms.
1448985973103202305	@Christo07327347 @RealKevinNash I will not be in the ICU, turn your TV off and get off facebook and you will be free from covid. Overstated, fake numbers, false tests, false death rates. Covid is real, but not anything like they made it out to be
1375565195469336586	@NBCNewYork It's so important. I have patients who have been notified and monitored by the NYC Test &amp; Trace corps.  It's crucial to inform those who have been exposed, and for those who have been diagnosed with Covid, to stop the spread
1459591211363323908	@davidbwalker5 @CTVToronto I cant answer that but you can get covid twice. I thought I had covid...my GP sent me to hospital for possible pulmonary embolism which is a symptom of covid because I could barely breathe. Covid negative...lots of tests...scarred lungs...never smoked...but still covid negative
1375817744629833731	I feel fine at the moment, but the test result came back as positive for Covid 19 so I probably won't be able to post much of any art for a couple weeks
1461310487560396800	@troypallotto My wife manages the OR of the biggest Covid hub in south jersey, 100% of the people hospitalized with COVID are unvaccinated but I’ll trust you I guess because you have an American flag in your Twitter handle.
1347580659062231046	as if i’ve just tested positive for covid THE NIGHT BEFORE MY COVID VACCINE
1480586969256103939	@lone_alien Yeah, I'm so tired today. And now I know they both tested positive for covid last week before leaving work, I'm paranoid I've got it, even though I tested negative last week.
1506436376056766471	@redsteeze Why does she test positive the day before trips abroad?  Also, why are other “high profiles” announcing Covid positive today?  It smells to me.
1476339365265739780	@FergalBowers Does related to covid mean they died from cancer but tested positive in hospital? I have seen old death certs where person died from cancer but “hospital acquired pneumonia “ was number 1 on death cert.
1474810792591560704	@jameyjean 4 of my close family members tested positive for COVID a few days ago. We're having Christmas by Zoom this year. You are 100% not being unreasonable.

1412607404689137665	@gmen0475 @Alyssa_Milano Very slowly. Get NUTRAFOL. There’s obvious new growth but nothing like the head of hair I had before Covid, 1 year since I was in the hospital. I was just looking at pictures I took of my arms from Covid mid July 2019. Horrifying to say the least. A muscle wasting disease. https://t.co/6vXAqfPojG
1477940877456986113	@zellishrows It never ceases to amaze me the amount of trust put in something so useless. They only score +ve a fraction of the time (based on me having had Covid and a + PCR, 1+ LFT AND 3- In the same 24hrs). I'm more likely to get a positive pregnancy test...
1381654093559689223	POSITIVE FOR COVID: Country music artist Luke Bryan announced that he has tested positive for COVID-19. 'I tested positive for COVID but I’m doing well and look forward to being back at it soon,' Bryan wrote. https://t.co/yfLkDdKBGh

1584232725321781248	@KristinRaworth You don't need the internet. All you need to do is open your eyes, look around. Not vaxed, never had a cold let alone covid. My entire family is and have had it multiple times, several to the icu, and no they haven't been around me.
1475973895744364549	I tested positive for covid today :(
1419066006039777282	All of those ignorant and selfish bastards need to look into the face of another human being in hospital from covid and see if they can say to them “You don’t matter to me. Your life isn’t worth my inconvenience.” Because that’s what their march is about. #sydneyprotest
1479265826444296198	@caro_vina @BenjaminLinas Lol I stopped reading when that person compared covid to the measles or polio!! Do you know what the mortality rate was for those?! Do you honestly know what it is for covid? Let try. If you get covid what are your odds of being hospitalized or dying?
1392953798851661825	I just wanna let y’all know I was fully vaccinated in early March. Last Friday I tested positive for COVID AND I DEADASS FELT LIKE A BRICK FOR LIKE 4 DAYS SO PLS. Mind you I be wearing my mask 😔😔😔

1336037938304528387	@paulgazelka Just so I understand this, you: 1. Attended a GOP Dinner with 100+ attendees in November.2.  Failed to notify other lawmakers of a potential outbreak3.  Tested positive for COVID4.  Requested you be prioritized for vaccine.5.  Now share stories of a COVID fraud/conspiracy?

1510777297544089611	@cauley_anne @angusreidforum Yeah, because so many children have gotten so I’ll they’d have to go to the hospital for treatment because of this virus. I think the numbers are like 28 in a million. And not even close to that number of children have caught the virus. 24 children since the start of COVID have

1373658169528975362	After a year of social distancing, masking, teaching, and getting my first dose of the vaccine, I tested positive for Covid.

1439793862143184896	Back went out and I can’t feel the left corners of my lips. Don’t want to go to the hospital because COVID... fml
1368414670063861760	@yaakov_h Where I live, the rule for asthma is that you qualify for the earlier vaccine round if your asthma has led to hospitalization in the past year.There was at least once in the past year when I probably should have gone to the ER, but didn't, because I was afraid of Covid there.
1478495034035118082	One of the more mind boggling things happened to @JeffBarker_ and me on the golf course today.We get paired with two strangers to round out our group of 4.The first thing they told us is that they tested positive for COVID yesterday. (1/637284837262)
1474683576272752640	So yesterday youngest got 2 positive lat flows which is why we didn’t go to rellies BUT I’ve had full on Covid symptoms (fever, body aches, nausea, constant headache, off me food and booze (?!)) but I cannot get a positive test for love nor money. Will do a PCR tomo. https://t.co/NiK4e0nIoP
1478473300674334721	@Clau19071827 @MiamiDadeMso @MiamiSup @MDCPS 🙄 I’m sure you kid loves wearing a mask to school all day, mine don’t so they will not be wearing a mask, we’re going on 2 years and almost everyone around them has had COVID and they’ve never tested positive and we don’t wear masks anywhere!
1488542255828897794	i also tested positive for covid :')
1416250848917741571	@ToTheLifeboats @LarryGr41412122 No, a colleague of mine is an ICU doc that has seen NO vaccinated ppl in the ICU. They are ALL unvaccinated. He and I both have not seen ANY serious vaccine reactions but DAILY see long haulers with serious health consequences of Covid. Please stop speaking nonsense.😱
1422765945882349577	So today I tested positive for covid 19 to say it was like a guy punch is putting it mildly. Despite being cautious and vaccinated. I’m scared but I have to look towards the hills from which cometh my help and that’s God
1385187666002546689	Update #3: so I’ll explain some confusion firstly. I had COVID late December/ early January. Literally how I started off my new year haha but yea, that’s why this new positive test was all confusing. I’ve been receiving meds and still hooked up to the oxygen machine.
1508025769892712453	Day 7 since first positive test, probably day 10 of actual Covid. It took 10mins to show which meant I thought I was clear for 10mins.I’ve been lucky with symptoms but I want to get back to normal now!!! https://t.co/kqrXJeUXAh
1477756738250149892	@NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK Yes it does. Believe me I know we all have to chip in. But you have nurses in hospitals who can’t even get their own Covid test at the hospital they work at. But come in five days after you tested positive and have no symptoms. They are being treated as they are disposable!!
1387356782687932418	@Mariocaprisun @ZubyMusic Not where I am, but places like Michigan they are, despite vaccinations. To your point, you are saying a decrease is due to vaccinations in those with COVID. Because they are vaccinated, but still got COVID, they don't need to be hospitalized and they don't die like they used to?

1387354910669291520	I think Covid does exist I don’t believe in testing being accurate. I had allergies and super congested last week so much better this week after I got a day off. Tested positive at work for the second time they retested negative😅
1528872009022640128	I tested positive for Covid today. Thankfully I am vaccinated and boosted and am only experiencing mild symptoms. I know we all want to be done with Covid but Covid is not done with us yet.

1484808435338452995	Been following all covid precautions but I need regular checkups along with bi-monthly tests. Today I was informed all of them (doctor and the test guy) are positive. So now I have to isolate myself again.

1374135445324464132	A year ago today I came down with Covid 19 but as there was no track and trace or testing at the time, like many others who had it last year and were not admitted to hospital there is no statistic of me having it
1478640345839648769	"@libsoftiktok I guess missing a COVID test appointment automatically tags the test as ""positive""........."

1364086281672785924	@TCRG2012 @ann_neona That sounds great but we still don’t know how much real immunity there is. I was told i have a few weeks. I just had Covid, have asthma and had to go to the ER. This crap is VERY bad and I don’t know that I would survive a 2nd round. I want a vaccine the minute I’m eligible!
1347651771020111872	@M_Lumberjack It’s crazy because it doesn’t prevent you from getting it or spreading it but rumor has it where I work if you get covid and get admitted to hospital they might make me pay the full cost. I don’t trust the vaccine right now not near enough testing
1478477489802522625	I'm terrified. The room next to mine in our dorm the 3 ladies had positive covid tests. So the ra and wants our entire floor to go get tested. My appointment is tomorrow morning.
1538850725798694912	@benshapiro I think this is a spoof.  Lorenz said the same thing to a guy who actually questioned long covid, and she posed her haughty response, and he then posted a picture of him when he was hospitalized with long covid and told her to learn to lighten up.
1473772082999746572	@covidini22 @reima_kokkonen @MikaRajala6 @HakkinenVikke @TurtiainenAno Umm they do know and vaccine does not cause positive covid test. So those people that did not get covid during that time and are in hospital are not counted as covid icu patients😂. Ofc if you have data to proof your claims i am all ears.
1467536232603435012	@FCDOtravelGovUK I recently recovered from covid, and have to travel to the UK this month. It's recommended to not do PCRs for a month or two after having covid, as the result will be positive. What should I do about my day 2 test?
1475561557262319620	@liverazzi I am very aware of the numbers and also care for critically ill kids with COVID. Children in general are rarely hospitalized or die, so we could say this about every single disease. Enough with the moral panic about kids with cancer!
1484270885083271171	Listen… has anyone here been diagnosed with Covid and it ended up causing spotting or messing with your period cycle? I’ve been googling stuff and I guess there’s somewhat of a correlation but it’s just such a weird symptom to me &amp; I feel crazy
1419808546313670659	@HeidiMdx @chriske52963146 So I knew someone who was sick with the supposed flu in the beginning of COVID. Ended up having an antibody test which was IgM +. I said good for you, you are protected. That was in March/April. Then in June was going to go to another state and took a PCR test &amp; it was positive
1451549100533497882	@Miss_vick_ Bys are like “ BUT WILL I BE ABLE TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL THREE MONTHS FROM NOW PADDY. THATS THE QUESTION” ffs. And they think that people are blowing the covid thing out of proportion 🤣 they’re more paranoid than people who are following public health recommendations
1437874325512728596	I just spoke with the White House Vaccinations Coordinator, Dr. Bechara Chouchair. He points to the fact the majority of people in the hospital battling COVID or dying from complications from it, are unvaccinated.@wrtv @ikehaji46 @bchoucair46
1453021987429765126	Am I wrong to understand that we will need to make a gofundme before any overseas tour just in case one of us gets a positive covid test before coming home so we can afford  quarantine? No more UK/euro/Japan tours in the future I fear. https://t.co/wVGn9Rv8hO
1483582572739186688	@MailOnline im sure the hospitals got paid more like they do in the US if the test positive for covid its a money making machine for them meanwhile  the virus didnt kill them

1291495285525536768	@dotjenna Stupid Abbott is now pushing the flu vaccine and I've heard that most people who got  covid-19 had taken the flu vaccine last year or at the very least, they received positive test results.
1452208384363700228	@AMHotFlash @TomBall20211 Sorry for your loss, truly I am.We've seen incidents like you describe post vax as well with the conclusion that it was as a result of the vax. In Europe, predominantly vaxed in hospital, non vaxed are not all Covid.Investigate side effects further, it might surprise you.
1418570022880956423	@xecor27 @benshapiro If the vaccine is so great then how come people who are vaccinated are still being hospitalized?! If you have the antibodies from COVID that’s better anyways, I can donate my plasma, you can’t!
1360252119442485251	I keep seeing people sharing anecdotes of people that got the vaccine but still tested positive for COVID. The “this is why we’ll still need to be careful!” conversations have already started &amp; I want to unalive myself a bit.
1531690845274898432	Well shit… I just tested positive for covid 😑 thankfully, I’m dealing with mild symptoms, but it really sucks.If we met at SWCA, please get tested.
1462793474693120005	@RayMinehane @paulmurphy821 @TheOtherGordon I am agreeing that we need to start discriminating against anybody who has a higher chance of ending up in the ICU with covid. Unvaxxed, fat people, smokers and type 2 diabetes. All of those are choice related. Team fit and vaxxed!! Go team!
1407869675925508100	nung na quarantine ako and tested positive for covid, wala man lang akong natanggap na ganito. even words of encouragement from people around me. BUT I AM NOT SEVENTEEN
1480232190592131077	So my six-year-old nephew has tested positive for COVID.We’re rapidly approaching the “anger of a gentle man” portion of this pandemic…
1374369250555535369	One of the things I like about @fotoole's article today is that he draws on Anna Burns' Milkman to explain COVID. This underlines (again) that whenever there's a new problem in Ireland, one of our writers has already diagnosed it, explained it, and sometimes even offered a cure..
1424855553944309763	@cher I’m @ home with covid… it’s running rampant here in Florida. I work for local government &amp; they are covering up the cases. Still forcing us to work in the office even though so many city employees have tested positive in the past month alone.
1477368366780272642	@ochocinco I tested positive for covid this morning. Happy New Year!
1426918337947242499	@radtam @ScottAdamsSays I would like to agree with you as I’ve had covid and tested positive for antibodies 10 months after infection. I have not seen any documentation other than opinion to support this. Are you aware of studies to support this? Hoping you can point me to some links.
1481996091302510593	I tested positive as well but I opted not to register. Mas maraming walang access sa gamot at sanitary items kumpara sa’kin. You can make an instructional video even if hindi mo ma-experience firsthand ang Bayanihan E-Konsulta at COVID kit ng OVP. 👎🏽👎🏽 https://t.co/SpPFVAr55I
1515984667136122886	@moonvic76 I had it pre vaccines and was nearly admitted to hospital. Off work for 5 months. Now Long Covid. Still mask and take precautions. It’s such a nasty virus (and more than just respiratory) xx
1344582388714795009	One of my residents have tested positive for Covid and they decided to tell me this after I have already been around him. Thank fuck for PPE and being able to get the vaccine already, let’s pray I only need the first 50% of the jab🙃But in other news I am gonna stream tonight😝
1468172504141385730	I took a Covid test this morning and sadly, I tested positive. So anybody was at @InsaneChampWres on Sunday might want to take a test as well just to be on the safe side. I'll be missing the last ICW show of 2021 this coming Sunday as that's within the 10 day isolation period.
1437852340413894656	I know many people who aren't vaccinated and haven't caught covid. Yet every single person I know who has been vaccinated has caught covid, some cases were so severe they had to be hospitalized. The ones unvaccinated who got covid (all over 7 months ago) had a mild case.
1353989198454390786	@piersmorgan my mum received the vaccine on 21st Dec, sadly we lost her on 18th Jan, tested positive for covid a week after vaccine 😢
1377240697120645125	@CathyYoung63 There is 0 net positive for someone like me, 25, had covid and only had a headache. In great health. To get a vaccine that hasn’t even been tested for a year and isn’t FDA approved. Asymptotic spread has been proven to be insignificant.
1419835799168856083	@fluffyguy Hello @fluffyguy ! Glad you are coming through strong. Just wanted to give you an update that our mutual buddy Cleto has come down with Covid and is currently in the hospital. I’m sure an encouraging word from you would make his day. God bless bro!
1542601721163169793	@Maffewgregg Had a positive covid test this morning, worst sickness I’ve ever had.Bed ridden for most of today, bad fever, dizzy/confused, and I’ve got the swollen glands in my throat which is🤌🏻Worst part is that I can’t even play games because my eyes are SUPER sensitive to light now😭
1502773797812043776	@verslibre I have Covid symptoms, tested negative, the husband has tested positive.
1490707955565617156	@magacovfefe117 Had Covid Pneumonia. The doctor in the hospital gave me Pepsid. He said it keeps covid from attaching to the lungs. I also refused remdev. Unless given in the first 3 days, it does nothing. He agreed. Heavy does of steroids is needed. Z-pack if it turns into a bacterial infection
1374979626284515333	3 cases of covid in my class (out of 11 students.) and one is in the hospital and uni just ?????? oh im so pissed
1379954160389533697	@Jasperlope @JuanitoLiteral While that comparison group is noteworthy, I don’t think that specifically addresses the question here, the answer to which is significant. A more adequate control group would be those having never tested positive for covid &amp; whether they experience an increase in same disorders
1478443812754182149	@CBCAlerts @canadamelissa3 Lack of testing pffft allow me. So we know that 1% of covid cases requires the ICU. There are over 240 cases in ICU. Therefore the true case count in the wild is closer to 24,000 cases. CBC dont math and stats anymore? What happened? Oh right, right .... https://t.co/C1io299jO7
1490810333283647492	@SlackerSloth @nz_sparkle seems like kiwi's are sick of this and no longer bothering to get tested so they have have their freedoms removed from them for a months... BTW how long did cindy isolate for after she was shown to be covid positive... rules for thee but not for me huh
1488165641332924421	@wilescape @chainga1ns @jklinders @WalmartNK @deAdder And again, do you think the virus acts differently in europe. 😂😅🤣 I guess you also missed the CDC saying more than half of covid hospitalizations reported are due to people having covid but not hospitalized because of covid.
1385401276448509954	"@JUtahOSU89 @rundingoboyrun @BluePolitica @JimJamison84 @Jim_Jordan You goofballs won't take me out of the @ so I have to listen to you bicker like posturing high schoolersBut while we're on COVID, I have not yet heard any reason a ""positive"" 45-cycle PCR test  is anything but bullshit pretending to be science. Can anyone help me find one?"
1380169797196001284	Thinking about that time when clown college made me take a saliva covid test, it came back a false positive, then I took a PCR test (obviously negative), and I still couldn’t come into clinic for a week #akayesterday
1512883267644579841	@dbglisson Which sentence makes more “common sense” #1. I tested positive today for Covid. Thankfully I followed the science and got the 48 vaccinations &amp; 107 boosters! Or: #2. I tested Negative for Covid 19 today. Thankfully I followed the Science and got my recommended vaccine. WTF?
1460592674415726604	@Scott_WJ_21 @IamRomanWatson @lmw1308 @GeorgeTakei If you were talking about people sick in the hospital with Covid-19, then the survival rate of that group is way lower than 97%. I don’t care if they risk themselves, but our medical system is exhausted and can’t serve the vaccinated population’s regular medical needs.
1421337866060304385	@djconnel @dontmeanathing @SeamusBlackley @cbouzy What I’m saying is, with more spread, soon enough everyone will either be vaxxed or have gotten Covid. At that point, most ppl won’t be getting so sick they end up in the hospital or die.
1467817633554878467	@TravelodgeUK London city Airport please avoid at all cost before arrival I booked 2 rooms 1 couple caught covid wasn't able to attend can't get money bck considering 1 of them in hospital bar area rubbish on floor not cleaned for weeks no sanitiser empty in all areas room staine
1451572432741879809	Waiting on a call back now. I have to get my doctor to send me to an independent imaging center because I absolutely will not allow PCR testing, or any COVID testing to be done on me, so I can't go to the hospital for the X-ray. God bless you all and may your day be a happy one.

1526600777938219009	The only testing I want to hear about is antibody testing. Note - it's the only testing you DON'T hear about. Why?Because more than a year ago wherever they tested they got over 95% positive for antibodies.Testing for covid is of NEGATIVE value.
1598490617390178307	@RainyTerrell I’m sick with Covid. Tested positive today 😔 Hope you’re doing well 🫶
1301615641317826560	Robert Pattinson tested positive for covid....that’s it, I’m finding the vaccine myself
1382763100181561347	@Byil32 @DannyMeinz @Katebits people think you can’t get Covid again once you had it &amp; you definitely can. It doesn’t matter your age. I see people in the ICU of all ages dying right now. I think your opinions are valid &amp; in no way do I think you should be forced to get a vaccine. That’s your choice.
1474762534892851202	i really have to get covid tested ugh i feel so shit but i don’t drive so i don’t wanna make someone else drive me if i’m positive for covid
1451234001004351510	@straps0n @racquetball54 @ozzycorp1976 @squeelin56 @WADeptHealth I'm the moron, yet you think someone who dies of cancer, with no covid symtpoms, yet test positive for covid, should be counted as a covid death? Got it 🤣
1445099673119862787	@CashMon84244436 @redrockwizard @Timcast Since 60 percent of hospitalized Covid patients are vaccinated, I guess everyone should pay more.
1506220548233248775	@BaelaLayla @JansInput People are morons Very simple if some asshole gives you shit about your 😷 Just take the mask off cough in his or her face and tell them you were wearing the mask because you just tested positive for CovidThen say I hope you have a good day!
1416390881419022336	@DanielAndrewsMP Nah you need to get this zero covid bullshit out of your head! I ain’t going to happen, especially when vaccinated people transmit the virus. And what about the hospital numbers? Any in icu? If so how many vaxxed…. 🤬. #resign #ivermectin
1461378542197956613	@troytwc Don’t think it’s been reported but myocarditis doesn’t necessarily always come from having Covid. I covered two or three tragic high school sports deaths in Fla in the 90s and the players were diagnosed with myocarditis postmortem
1375920240123654144	After finally getting an appointment for the vaccine, I have to cancel it. And I may have covid so that’s great. 😑 I took a rapid test at @CityMD and the doctor was like oh it looks like it’s coming up positive 30 seconds after doing it. 😑 Worst doctor I might have ever seen.
1434334619176890374	@dekofler @ggld @ImranKhanfromN1 @ashishkjha Which univ? Any policy/guidance on how to quarantine for students  that test positive? Contact tracing?Is check in the honor system, “I  don’t have Covid checkbox”?

1436431960537243652	@sandieganmommy I am because it’s been proven that both vitamins boost your immune system,they have worked for me so far. I’ve had COVID,everyone in my household has had it,one one had to go to the hospital,and that was because he has asthma AND it was BEFORE we had even heard the term Covid.
1330848444160815104	@PeterHotez I was diagnosed with Guillian-Barre Syndrome after a vaccination have you seen any evidence that this could happen after any of the Coronavirus vaccine? Thank you, I am asking because I am vaccine hesitant
1474754198327726089	@Retlouping Explain to me : how can you have false positive? Only way i know. You’ve had it before and you still have dead corona virus gens in your nose . How u can have false negative : your test is not done correctly. You agree / disagree?
1412522407722639360	So even though I tested positive for covid still gotta go to work tomorrow
1387776834633412612	@MichiganHHS I've been waiting for a covid follow up for three days since my positive test. Any reason it's taking so long?
1450881110133649418	@BluemanSuperman @daveabrowne @Jim_Jordan 97% of people in the hospital for COVID are unvaccinated. Now, put your politics aside for one minute and try to think about what that means.I know it's hard for you, but try.

1482838091912024069	@ryancarson I know quite a few who got COVID recently.  All were fully vaccinated. Some tested positive, some not.
1430656450628620289	I'm sat outside the ER in my car, while my wife is inside in pain, due to the ER no longer allowing visitors in because of rising Coronavirus numbers. All thanks to the state's continuing inept management of COVID-19, and the idiotic anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers.
1399828593908330496	Lmaooo i have to ask people’s numbers to do their covid test, i asked this guy and he goes “well when you gon call me😏” Nigga if that covid test comes back positive😂😂😂😂
1476265580785246222	It. My roommate works at a high end hair salon where she does hair to really rich people that think covid doesn’t exist. She tested positive and I’m sure that’s who I got it from and it’s okay shit happens and we can’t control it

1397873177745707013	I've tested positive covid 19 last year. I was totally fine, but my other family member not. However I've been through a treatment very well. Nothing impossible. I've recovered just in a week. I followed doctor's instructions, specially don't stress about it...
1403048758355582982	Sad to report that - in addition to being trapped in hospital w no care package etc - my quest to equal my @guardian #quickcrossword pre severe COVID record of 4 mins 48 secs is dashed! #TheGuardian has removed access to crosswords from #SupporterMembers &amp; #Premium is too dear.

1425167208552882177	@denniss9117 Here’s the lie! As a covid survivor myself I can tell you. No legit medical facilities retests a covid positive person Because even when cured dead covid particles remain in your nose for up to 90 days. That’s why people who tested pos for covid aren’t retested 4 90 days.
1550144886464184324	BREAKING; After “mistakenly” saying he has cancer, Joseph R. Biden has now tested positive to COVID 19! Yes, COVID! You thought we were over it, right? I knew we weren’t.

1396446387462500352	Believe me , the vaccines work. Even if you catch covid and ur SpO2 levels fall below 90, or u a have comorbidities. you can still dodge the bullet. I don't know about the icu ward, but I didn't find anyone getting shifted to icu from my ward. Patients who were on O2 support,
1386319287732736000	Love the daily N*te S*lver tweet telling us its okay if young people are hospitalized and dying of covid. Its as comforting as my morning tea.
1420188351601258497	@CalebHowe Why is it that he was not given HCQ when he was first diagnosed ?? They know it would have saved his life !! Even a 15 year old study proved that much !! As for the vaccine there's oevidence that it prevents you from catching covid !! As for me my immune system is stronger !!
1471168146669199366	@DandyLyons044 Idk what’s normal anymore but they sent someone at my job home who is vaccinated but exposed to covid for eight days and he never tested positive lol. In NY they also stopped paying people for time missed so if you don’t have any more sick time you’re fucked 🥴

1500974234839007232	I've had so many colds this year the one time I think I have another cold and don't bother testing for covid because all the other times it was negative and just a cold I actually end up getting covid 😅 only did a test because a family member was positive 😬
1379466997759631360	@stealthprm Oh.... got it... that’s right. Because the people I know who died didn’t impact me. The days I spent in the hospital with Covid didn’t impact me. The 4 months it took me to recover didn’t impact me. You’re right. Thanks for reminding me that this country is full of assholes.
1374737516193005571	@pervocracy Partner and I both got vaccinated then four weeks later tested positive for Covid. I had extremely mild sore throat. He had bad cough &amp; fatigue. That doesn't count as a 'failed vaccine' it just means he'd probably still be in hospital or dead if he hadn't got the jab
1482638279019151360	@BeckSheri @amyriscool @Mauigirl52 @Chrissylynn7264 She was at home when she got sepsis. She had had covid for about ten days already, but became suddenly much worse. I can understand your concern though. You never know what extra infections you are going to pick up in the hospital. Hope you have recovered!
1379225899778850821	@kelseyo0211 Definitely. Hope none of them get Covid from this though.  I had it and was hospitalized for 2 weeks with it. Wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. It sucks. BAD.
1471227947805777920	@StephenConlon7 Daily testing and I hope not otherwise have all the game in hand actually apparently 2 more players tested positive today and were sent home I hope we don’t get anymore back luck I hate Covid

1573765409605566464	@SylviMcW @wolsned I’ve been asked that a few times well before covid was even a thing. At one point if you had blood drawn in the hospital (not GP’s) it was routinely tested for it. Again, pre covid. Not had bloods since except once after surgery.
1606397424871817216	@agargmd @CampsNP @Butterfly329 @kenjaques There is nothing to tell me except that because I am fully vaccinated and boosted, my COVID will be less severe than an unvaccinated person who tests positive using this exact same test.
1471355992671547393	@zoomshaftmorris @latbbolch So, if the entire team and staff is vaccinated, and they test positive for COVID (I say test positive because they almost certainly wouldn’t even know they had it had they not been tested), what do you advise the next step be in all of this?
1452341357977034752	I tested positive for COVID. I’m fully vaccinated. Have been since It was first available for me to be vaxxed. Always wear my mask EVERYWHERE. Always followed proper protocols. Stayed safe.STILL GOT IT. GET VAXXED. STAY DILIGENT. STAY MINDFUL. BE RESPONSIBLE.
1379452568137515012	Hey @RealJayWilliams you told me the covid vaccine was effective but my wife just tested positive and she is fully vaccinated. I put my trust in you what the hell?!?!!
1454597839519031301	@flemsha @DeanRosario I’ve been told that cases in hospital are only regarded as covid in hospital for 14 days. If they are still in hospital after 14 days they are not considered covid cases anymore.
1475677589259886600	@j3nnard I have to “prove” to my job that I have it to get PAID time off. And a positive test is not enough for it to them. I asked them if I’m just going to have to get covid, walk in to corporate offices, and make out with the CEO to prove it and I got in trouble lmao.
1331368704546902018	Guys I went to the bar on Friday and sat. Felt totally fine. Went and got covid vaccine last Thursday and then tested positive for virus on Friday. The vaccine totally gave me covid. Can I sue?
1436542502258020352	@addict_opium @Francenozoica @polanimalspod @ONS @PHE_uk What virus? Where is it? Myself and my family have yet to see ANYONE we know test positive for Covid let alone be hospitalized or die. Yet we know several who've been affected by the vaccine. This is absolute BS! I am not getting a vaccine for a GD cold!
1397972633615056897	@axhxo1 Poor Mr. Shafqat Mehmood... He got cursed by all the students of Pakistan and tested positive for Covid. Or so I heard
1348658865760595969	I continue to hear how many deaths from COVID and how many test positive for the virus.  The only way to deal with it is the VACCINE.  WHERE IN HELL IS THE VACCINE?
1471904940230688770	@badlefty @bit_noob Hate to break it to you, but everybody is going to get covid. Difference is the vaccinated will be sick for a few days, while the unvaxxed will be the ones in the ICU and dying. Im good with it.
1479228137225568261	The thing that concerns me about #StarTrekPicard news that over 50 folk tested positive for COVID is that it's not a small film or local tv show. It's an acclaimed Paramount/CBS show so they have compliance workers making sure everyone is following every precaution. Didn't help.
1340075604453044230	I was on an allergy immunotherapy treatment a few years ago where I went into anaphylaxis and ended up in the ER. Due to this I’m not eligible for the Pfizer Covid vaccine, but I’m hopeful that there will be one I can eventually get.
1379067470628200448	The headline today is for all people in England to be offered a COVID test twice weekly. I read recently that many people don’t report positive results and go on as if nothing happened. I’m concerned that the colossal cost for this may be a waste. Imagine not acting on a + result
1476343392183492614	@NicolleDWallaceIn the USA: My nephews contracted COVID 3 days ago and were admitted to the ER this morningIn India:Oct 12, 2021·TwitterThe SEC nod to administer Covaxin for children between 2-18 is a huge step in our fight against #COVID19Why is COVAXIN not available here?
1588005407808782336	I have not had COVID 19. This entire time. I have even tested when I had a scare. No positive test for COVID 19. Still I socially distanced. Am I part of the X Men?
1435197155015372805	@makesmilk I had to do a test because I had been traced of having been in contact with someone who tested positive. Through the NHS Covid app I could either order or book a test for that reason.
1469665623605133318	@jack92258550 And I see it too mate working in the hospital's etc, doing covid cleans all over the north east from Berwick to Bradford and coast to coast
1475955335013744649	I'm kind of livid. One of my guys is not vaccinated, was around people all day Saturday, and now one of those people has tested positive for Covid. So now, with two other people on vacation, I have to tell him to stay home until he comes back with a negative test.
1613966611626733568	@GeneEva49485150 Gene, I’m in my 60’s and had Covid. Rather than play Russian roulette with an untested mRNA vaccine,  I went to the hospital and received a half hour monoclonal intravenous dip and I was fine in a day and a half. I’m a #pureblood But U just #Keeponboosting 😂
1519045164018327553	“COVID is a virus that causes something called a pandemic and there is a test to detect it…Giggle! Giggle!” VP Kamala Harris ‘explains’ she has tested positive, and goes on to reassure, “But luckily I was not in close contact with any of my staff,if any are still around…Ha!Ha!” https://t.co/A58QVkt6yn
1437269613159587840	@wats37100346 @Marcatanas1216 @ashishkjha 2183 admitted to hospital with Covid in PA. 9.1% positivity rate. I agree that the masking indoors in nearly nonexistent. Thankfully the vaccines holding the line.
1431339926004502528	My fully vaxxed husband tested positive for COVID today. He teaches at a charter school that has a Utah state senator’s children enrolled in it. I can’t tag the senator because he deleted his twitter, but I hope his kids fail P.E. this year.
1595242520874721280	"@Its_Just_J1 @Russell117C @Sam_the_Yank @Thom_WMD @Timcast I was quarantined in the hospital for 4 days in the ER this summer because of COVID. Of course, I was admitted for an infected cat bite and just happened to test positive while I was there, but last year I would have counted as a ""COVID hospitalization."" That's just a fact."
1473639891858776068	My morning begins with my Boyfriend wanting to get covid tested...Idk what work will do to me if he's positive? Find out next time.
1387419450740183040	I have tested positive for covid. This kinda sucks
1406337417880256514	@Marlah_Cara $halfofmysoul - hello! I would be so grateful 😭 I was an essential worker, a substance abuse counselor, but I tested positive for covid. While I was recovering, my position was eliminated and it’s been so hard finding work. Appreciate anything 💝
1410109020300451845	@NZNeep Yep, I’ve seen how fats around the world have worried about how they would be treated if admitted to hospital about Covid and it’s a real concern
1476743853893902337	Okay so question?? So my roommate got tested for covid and it was negative. How do the test work? How early can it test positive? She got the pcr test so like someone know?
1481995788918087680	And why did I wake up to see that two people that plan on going to the Chicago show for ATEEZ, tested positive for COVID and still plan on going?? https://t.co/Sm0T4nNHQe
1388221555159683072	Idk what’s going on, it may be a variant and I’m not completely sure, but COVID has been hitting people hard in my area. Even seeing people my age in the ICU with the only co-morbitity being they are overweight. Please get vaccinated so I don’t have to see you at the hospital 🙏🏼
1381070585103589378	@antontroian @DuckeEmile I live in the U.K. where if you fall out of a window within 28 days of a positive test, you are added to the Covid deaths...And people trust it 😂
1393149228248096770	@carlquintanilla @brianstelter @ukpapers I’m still wearing a mask.Had a patient get both Pfizer vaccines 2 months ago.He died last week in hospital from Covid.I’m still wearing a mask.
1448510711240425473	@richardhills777 Yeah such a great poster who doesn't give two shits about the harm this Pfizer jab is doing.  18 yes 18 people  I know died, stroked, harmed &amp; many still suffering from this jab. How many covid positives have you seen and how were they treated.  How many in hospital 2 weeks back?
1431846914039824389	Okay folks: another Covidiot that will probably be in the hospital with Covid in the near future. I hope his karma doesn’t run over his dogma as the guy’s did…. This isn’t a dress rehearsal; it’s real!
1477388212565905421	@SabinehazanMD I've been on 5 continents and I suspect the great diversity of my experience has made the difference for me. 3 weeks ago I was working every day with someone who was diagnosed with Covid and is still under the weather, but I've been fine.
1369841543314604040	I got the Johnson &amp; Johnson Vaccine earlier today since it’s 1 Dose, let me tell y’all I am going through it with the chills 😬 I never tested positive for Covid-19 since the start and now I feel like 🤕🤒😷🤧
1419307390688661508	@JerasIkehorn I know an older man that died and a young man who was hospitalized with Covid pneumonia. (This was before the vaccine.)
1436936187097276416	@shellie_ratliff I personally know one person who is vaxxed and has tested positive, at first they said strep then after a return trip to the Dr tested positive for Covid
1468351853716914179	i get my covid booster shot early bc i volunteer in the hospital heheheehehe https://t.co/s5PN95pAYR
1464789733394063360	@TimRunsHisMouth I was told about 10 minutes after I walked into a clinic that I had covid and was being taken to the hospital. 10 days later when I was leaving the hospital I asked for another to make sure I was negative. The nurse said no bc it would take a couple of days to get the results.
1388576400198848517	For the record I've had every jab! I am not an anti-vax, I even tested positive for TB at school and had these tablets that turned my pee orange for months!  I would of developed active TB, but to compare COVID19 vaccines to the great vaccines, is insulting our intelligence.
1373400958802214920	@Covid19Joker Worked everyday getting “exposed” to the virus many times, don’t mask, never tested and won’t be unless I’m dying and they need to know it. I have no intentions of getting vaccinated but I did get a call from a health department a couple hours away that I had tested positive. 🤷🏽‍♀️
1434743366143541248	It’s so bad with Covid in Sydney hospitals that my partner’s specialist just changed his chemo regime so he doesn’t have to be treated in hospital. Get vaccinated people. Please don’t wait.
1379964022724964353	"We have to ask questions like ""Have you been in contact with anyone who has been diagnosed with COVID in the last 14 days"" etc when we send a technician out and this dude just kept shouting NO NO NO NO NO as I asked the questions"
1558064571142774786	Then I had a few really good days in there at the end of July, but then I started vomiting again. Now, in early August, I’ve tested positive for COVID. All of these viruses keep compounding on me and it’s really frustrating and annoying to keep going through.
1422255322794807299	@mikegephart1 @ChristineMittl1 @FOX35Nico @RepStephMurphy @fox35orlando @GoodDayOrlando Well I’m a covid treating doc - saw 59 covid patients in the hospital this am  - nearly 100% of docs treating covid in the hospital know what works and what doesn’t. You think there is world wide conspiracy to suppress HCQ? It’s not about politics everywhere you know ?
1422364555280224275	@JohnNiblock2 I am so sorry! Wash she one of the elderly in the hospital?Was she classed as one of our covid deaths?I knew when Gutwein said what he said, that they would make sure there were more deaths! He isn't psychic!
1385216245297975304	@BrownRecord Most unfortunate and I genuinely feel for them.  However, having just spent a week in hospital ( blood clots -not Covid) and seeing the devestating impact of covid on so many on my floor it puts the hockey disappointment into a much different perspective.
1355146062684688388	"As far as I can tell, nobody in a trial who received a dose of any COVID vaccine (Pfizer/BNT, Moderna, Novavax, J&amp;J) has been hospitalized for COVID. Some ""severe disease"" in a few, but defined by O2 sat, not needing admission.https://t.co/CxhHk3z99H"
1473235428002127872	Just had to cancel my booster for the 2nd time. First time I got a positive Covid test just before, this time I have a really sore throat and feel like crap. No positive Covid test (yet?) but even so...I am really trying to get fully vaccinated damnit. 😭
1420078567661182976	I hope this part is obvious but if you can get vaccinated, PLEASE do. It is obviously better to get a mild case of COVID and potentially live with manageable chronic illness than die in the hospital.
1484960334221828097	@stephmurrayyyy When my kiddo was hospitalized for asthma this summer (not COVID), the respiratory therapist said they were seeing a lot of asthma and a lot of kids who had had COVID (often without symptoms) six months before and now in respiratory distress. Why does that happen in US not UK?
1474073523027005476	Out of all the things I’ve been tested for in the last month, Covid isn’t the worst thing to have popped up positive.
1574573188092395520	@jimmy_dore @DentonDeLoss @TeresaCicconi @fitterhappierAJ When I get a sense of when its ok not to.  I had COVID once and it put me in the hospital for a week, I do NOT want it again.
1430074406345265159	@grandmagrit 1) despite me being pro vax (and vaxed myself) i myself would want any hospital treating those who are in most danger 1st and foremost. and that is also regardless of if its covid or not (i.e people going to the ER for other issues like stroke heart attack ect ect)
1377100578401087498	I'll guarantee you that even if you are vaccinated, covid will still get into your system from someone passing it onto you airborne. It will be less severe though, but it's still in your system and YOU WILL get tested positive for COVID.
1520663543854641153	@AndILoveTheClub @moulinmusicaluk It’s sad for the whole audience. But nobody can predict when people will test positive with covid. If the cast/crew tested positive today, it’s likely they knew just before you did. I’d recommend getting tickets to a another show while in London, make the most of your trip.
1379890802038607874	@starsrewritten @CheerFessions1 That part !!! Meanwhile every other patient I treat walking in the ER has covid 🥴🥴🥴
1392566710474006531	@JoJoFromJerz @IngrahamAngle @cdc How many pediatrics COVID 19 have you seen come to the ER and better yet how many have you seen hospitalized.Treating kids as human “Bat” spreading a virus is insane.  If you want to continue with your “security blanket” (Mask) be my guess, but don’t keep enforcing  lunacy.
1473101576994701319	Someone close to me works at a covid test sight. They tested themselves 6 times negative. 7th time positive. They did it again a week later. Two test back to back one positive, one negative. Weird
1432095015325499395	My bro ended up in hospital with concussion (from footy - he's doing ok). He thought it was 2019. He'd never heard of Corona. 🤯Huh. Didn't think I'd be jealous, but here we are.
1513884895214542849	@DavQuinn I don’t even believe that there is 1,000 people in hospital with covid David. I really think the figures are inflated bullshit. I like how you spoke the truths during this whole shitshow man fair play to ya 👏👏👏👏
1569827745064157184	A young person in my life ended up in the hospital after having COVID (immune system stressed, brought on another condition) and I am so flipping mad at #BonnieHenry and others who actively rig the system so people are infectedUnbelievable
1476609935626571777	@AirbnbHelp Trying to claim under your Extenuating Circumstances policy as one of our guests tested positive for COVID. No one is responding to my help case to confirm if I need to cancel on my end or your team will cancel it and check-in is this afternoon.
1514568420695715841	@KatieMagnet DfT has required railway stations to remove all Covid related signage. It is clearly over 🙄During March two of my work colleagues tested positive. During the past week FIVE have tested positive. Stay safe everyone; the clinically vulnerable are left to fend for ourselves.
1375597050960605187	So I factually tested positive for COVID but morally I’m negative. I think I should still walk around, go to stores, fly on planes etc.
1487259082826428416	@theOGstud @ASkarimbas what is misleading? You can get COVID more than once. I was very sick Jan-Feb 2020, came close to dying. I got sick again end of March 2020 . I was antibody tested at a laboratory in April 2020 and positive. In June 2020 was retested and had no antibodies.
1452740590693666823	@Mattlev66074754 @i_only_ride_em @c0vfefeislyfe @calumtattoos @GenXnomadD @NeilClark66 Our entire family have recently had Covid. We’re all vaccinated. We caught it from my husband who was infected by an anti-mask, anti-vaxxer. I was quite ill for a few days &amp; I know that if I hadn’t had the vaccine I’d probably be in hospital right now.
1468364772278079488	I just tested positive for covid. I followed the science, social distanced, double masked, 4 shots +booster. The only explanation is that someone from Florida crossed state lines.
1553146287775776770	@ChuckCallesto There is zero evidence that ANY of the Covid vaccines help with omicron transmission or acquisition and I can tell you I Han patients in the hospital with Covid
1561100956577808384	@DublinLiving @NotAtAllHopeful @BillboBagginsX @TheNewConserva8 @DrAseemMalhotra @GBNEWS I know a few doctors. Fact is they were ordered to put covid as the primary cause of death if patient had a positive covid test regardless of what actually caused the death. I also believe the process was changed so only 1 doctor was needed to sign a death certificate
1427740006152474624	this is hard.. trying to get myself a covid test, trying to feel like I’m not ruining lives, trying to find positive in the future but it’s starting to look.. like im going to be on my own for awhile..
1422169005075357702	So when I went to the emergency room Saturday before last bc my leg was numb I balked when they said I would be checked in for the night!! “Uh No “I keep up with the news and do not want to be infected w Covid!! Does Bethesda west make their employees get vaccinated? I am but ?
1382423384961789957	@JamesMDavis615 @DanielGriffinMD Good question. I read the letter in JAMA carefully. The denom is not all US kids with covid. It's all kids in that database who had an ER visit or hospitalization for Covid. Among those kids, 12% had been admitted. Of those admitted, 1/3 went to ICU, consistent with CDC study.
1474399628724518914	@NHSuk apologies if I have missed this information but if you are still testing positive for Covid after 10 days isolation ends do you have to continue isolating until you test negative?
1437075141486333952	@LaikasLost @shellie_ratliff I know of plenty of people who have had the jabs and still ended up in hospital with covid.. 2 actually died aswell that I knew personally.. don’t know a single person unjabbed who have had it.. in 18 months!?
1379752152705433601	@allareblessed @AutArmadillo I'm doing everything possible, but I'm a primary supply teacher, which means I come into contact with ~150 different unmasked children from different households p/wk.I tested positive for covid 9 days ago. I'm under 30 with a good immune system and no pre-existing conditions.
1470799470854131717	@AFranzsen @rcr_pereira I’m here. 8/12 of our icu  covid cases are not vaccinated. We are over full at 26 beds. In surge 2 we ventilated 60 patients at once.The doubling time is 2 days, so even with a third the hospitalisation rate, the cases will arrive at once, in about 2-3 weeks in hospital and ICU
1434216636609794048	@1947Oceanblue @OregonGovBrown No but you must be....Oscar De La Hoya is a boxer and in good health and vaccinated is in the hospital with COVID....Jesse Jackson is also vaccinated and got COVID and was hospitalized, so tell me they work....https://t.co/84ZdpaxzXg
1371086822105886731	@dugdale1863 @LPrivileged @Conservatives @MattHancock @nadhimzahawi You obviously aren't seen the amount of coming forward after the vaccine having #COVID19 like i said even hospitalized i don't get why @MattHancock is being silent about post-vaccine POSITIVES there are hundreds if not thousands #ToryScum #ToriesOUT #QuitHancock
1424279784083927042	My bestfriend and her entire family covid this past week, no they were not vaccinated as her 6yr old was the one to get it and infect the whole family, however she did not end up in the hospital and suffered typical covid symptoms.
1415733900370972672	@Colabubble @SkyNews We don’t even really know if the 63 today ACTUALLY died from Covid or if they tested positive and then on day 27 died from a heart attack, that, believe it or not, goes down as a Covid death….Ridiculous I know.
1418303765552279552	He really said if you could’ve taken the vaccine to avoid this would you??? 🤦🏾‍♀️I had the vaccine and was still sitting in the hospital the same way. Doesn’t avoid anything. AT ALL. What’s crazy, when I didn’t have the vaccine,I NEVER caught Covid. And I was out more than I am now
1479875995385708545	Got tested for covid today. Turns out I am covid positive.  At first I thought it was just really bad strep throat but nope.
1485705378826493956	"I'm in my 60s. Natural #coronavirus (common cold) isn't deadly. All I needed was rest and OTC cold meds.  I know that both the diagnosed long covid and patented covid lung have a different and unnatural ""spread""- for fear and money. Hospitals are capable of euthanasia for greed."
1379108452765741059	The best response is: thanks, I just tested positive for Covid this morning, but I’m exercising my right to move about freely, I just don’t want to maybe kill you. Usually gets them to leave you alone
1385354306254163972	@ganjaginga I know a mask person, had the double vaccines n still tested covid positive. This month.
1388630755660685320	Just found out my manager at work who had symptoms tested POSITIVE for COVID.  😳
1389634900504969221	@TheDustyRebel @NateSilver538 I got Covid in Dec badly enough I spent 5 days in the hospital so I have some idea about PTSD and Covid. But the experts say enough about how effective the vaccines are in the short run at least that Covid now seems to have dropped down to normal risk levels (at worst)
1472982285351858176	@eduwonkette_jen @safeschoolsny @NYCHealthCommr I had a student test positive on her own for Covid. Amazingly students sitting to her also got Covid! Clearly they got it from outside of school.
1408637817828171778	If I tested positive for covid i would simply just refuse
1383917546315812870	just did my back to college covid test, hope it’s positive x
1461078592750862341	@MarionEveni1 Thank you 🤗.. I would have been able to take off but someone else tested positive with COVID but I worked through it and I'm feeling a little better today
1429188962967457795	While I respect your decision Re vaccination I think you're a hiding to nothing on this Travis. While you may get COVID, when vaccinated, the symptoms are not as severe &amp; you won't end up in hospital or dead. I feel this may be your Dixie Chicks moment. Happy to debate on air.
1483515004259295238	Perspective | I fought hard for you in the ICU. So did covid. https://t.co/EzBtES9RuH
1479843699710480386	The fact them kids I babysitted for 2 days straight tested positive for covid this morning bruh I’m finna go get tested 😩
1311909879901290497	Donald Trump lies so much, it’s hard to believe him when he says he tested positive for COVID. There is an angle here.Sympathy votes? Suddenly cured with bogus vaccine? I doubt he is being truthful here.
1439827439912378371	Was doing a strep test and the family failed to mention that two of their family members were covid positive. A child who I guess wasn't raised better turned his face right towards me and coughed in my face. I later covid tested him and he was positive. 😑
1479966949706588160	So, 2 years later, I’m tired. Is my Covid choice still the same. Yes, I wouldn’t go to the hospital. I want to die at home with my family, not isolated. I admire and respect our hospital workers. I also trust them. But Come On People QUIT BEING SELFISH and start saving lives. end

1337865630792310786	Last month I participated in J&amp;J’s COVID Vaccine trial, and today I tested positive for antibodies!  I highly encourage everyone to get the vaccine when it’s available to you! https://t.co/yJNY4fM0cV

1473642747122827264	@MomAngtrades My wife who's vaccinated tested positive for covid. We are just speculating on what variation it is but regardless it's just the sniffles and loss of smell so far. It's been since last Friday. Maybe this can be the end of this covid mess.
1388210203032698888	I got sick 13 days after my 2nd vaccine..  yes, I had a (mild) case of covid..  I mean seriously?   (Mild meaning I thought I had a terrible cold but didn't have to be hospitalized)

1559085129909379072	@Laura_Scott I read you could test positive for up to 90 days after having covid but weren’t contagious after day 10.
1614311998971432967	@Lapo13 @MichaelPSenger I knew they were over-reporting deaths to COVID in April 2020 when they changed the requirements for filling out cause of death on death certs. No positive test needed to state COVID as primary COD.https://t.co/cZxIxQBlb3
1522557692899905538	@NinaVincoffMD This is happening a lot. I know three women personally all under the age of 41 who were just diagnosed with breast cancers, ironically they were also all vaccinated for covid. The ones gals oncologist said she has seen a huge uptick in BC in 25yrs+ recently. Hmm....
1359562710837571590	@bubbajennyshri1 No, exposed to COVID. Rapid test said negative. Saliva test came back positive. Pending PCR nasal swab results. I’m mid vaccine, 2nd shot next week.

Great President! (back to bed) https://t.co/yCzVRLZ0Pu
1378966051153657857	“Everyone in England will be eligible for 2 free Covid tests a week”.  Bollocks. I don’t want test, I want a vaccine! People won’t use tests as they don’t want to find they’re positive and have to take time off with the wife! #COVID19
1486052937881292804	Well I got the covid first time Saturday and Sunday had the chills really bad decided to tuff it out went to work and when I got home from work I decided to do an at home test and sure as shit it was positive
1549066555153174528	Daily protest tweet about @GOVUK handling of the #COVID19 pandemic. The number of people who have died within 28 days of a positive Covid19 test is  180,718 (my maths from UK public data). Most of the culprits may have left office but it still happened on their watch.
1519761348544114691	debating on if i should fake a positive covid test to get out of a uni trip to scotland tomorrow...
1479566250862944257	@BellaBluz @JackieO1967 @CoClarified Right.. My bfs gran tested positive in hospital. She was there for a UTI. Two weeks later she died at home of covid pneumonia. It's really irrelevant. Stop playing semantics. Kids are getting it, and kids are becoming very unwell. And yes, the shots do reduce spread. End of.
1439153196740526086	@AndrewSolender 'It's only 1.7%' the covid deniers and antivaxxers say. 'Only the old and infirm', they say. 'Won't be me', they say. 'I don't care'.'Pity me,' they say, when they do get sick. 'Save me,' they demand, when they land in the ICU.
1584248431857438721	@GammaReigh I never tested positive, but I know I had Covid in February. My brain is not right. My ADHD is off the charts, and I have to really concentrate if I need to explain something. I just feel so off.
1471978653680644098	@benjaminlfc @stejakbetsamlew @LFCTransferRoom I’m not at all. You’re very wide of the mark. I’ve linked you some evidence but let’s forget all that. How many footballers have missed two games because of Covid? One (Hudsen-Odi) which also could have been a false positive test.
1470859202398666764	I agree...the Vaccine doesn't stop you from getting covid at all... people have gotten the shot and still tested positive for covid
1537819437784518659	@funder I didn't have to be hospitalized or die from Covid!!!
1351682136563134467	Just a quick update for y’all:• Get the antibody treatment if you can. Helped my wife a ton.• I’ve now tested positive, but my symptoms (so far) have been mild. Just sore and tired and covid brain is real. • It still really sucks to have this. Get the vaccine instead.
1380929457049976835	@yeetwheat99 @BillKristol Better I'll show you the photos of 7 people I know that died due to COVID, and 30 who were hospitalized due to it, and 8 that are long haulers.
1425907629038186497	@msdh The assumption is the Delta Variant, but the test just says your positive/negative for Covid, not the variant strain.  How many cycles is the PCR test being run to determine if you have it or not? This test is 50% reliable I’ve read and discontinued end of 12/21.
1437331774749790211	@Bobbing01 @dhogan8914 @BellaWallerstei I had covid March 2020 then when our residents got vaxed I got a positive test 2 weeks later
1410204001832943621	@AaronBower I'm baffled as to why the difference in outcome to Cas. Both clubs have injuries. Both clubs have a positive Covid test. Both clubs have large numbers isolating, the entire academy in Cas' case. Outcome different. Can the @TheRFL explain
1433900890331615233	@eyeslikebadu I know a travel nurse who refused to get the shot and had Covid three times, each time was worse. They’re probably early 20s I told them they’re playing with fire. Contract ended a couple months ago. Wonder if he’s hospitalized yet
1458133663107985415	Guess what? Same thing happened again, except this time the test came back positive. Thanks @UNCHealthyHeels for exposing me to COVID for no reason

1475969610281373696	So I will say it now: please go get vaccinated.I tested positive yesterday for covid. I'm in okay shape, but I'm vaccinated. The postnasal drip, sore throat, chills, and muscle pain are manageable. I can only imagine what this could be like otherwise.
1462728562675441664	As a sufferer of self-diagnosed long COVID, long fibromyalgia and more recently long symptomless COVID, you are very lucky to have got off so lightly. I can barely make it to the benefits office and wouldn’t wish my agony on anyone.
1487923337372356609	This sounds like the perfect opportunity for me to teach the yutes about Jesus (who died for our sins within 28 days of a positive Covid test)
1473279187708522507	We have no where in our area, where we can go to get tested for covid. All home kits are sold out. This is a mess. Someone where my hubby works has got covid &amp; in hospital. She's in the office &amp; the other person in there with her is still at work. Hubby won't go back  until (1/2)
1378886863809871872	@jeffpearlman Anytime you can avoid swapping air I guess that’s the preferred thing in a pandemic? I agree that it’s just to set an example/minimize risk. A couple teams had to forfeit because someone tested positive so covid is still contagious. I’ve been pretty impressed w the NCAA
1403562853248864256	@OHAOregon I heard they're not going to report people who have been vaccinated who catch covid now unless they get to the hospital
1612292630590914560	@DanaMerylBerger @thewdogg @united @Delta It should be good for one year (from booking). Same think happened to me on American. Still kind of annoying &amp; encourages ppl to fly with COVID. I lived in Cabo for a year &amp; ppl who tested positive were literally buying negative tests.
1485105790042132486	@DavidSteadson @WicMar @coronatragedin @toknell That's number of covid patients in hospital beds.I realize now that you probably want the total af any patients in hospital beds.

1436017161512919046	@pgsween So you can test positive for up to 3 months for Covid, yet not be contagious. I’d be curious to know/see if there is any guidance on these types of situations in the NFL. Any thoughts or knowledge on this by chance?

So we have millions of those every week. We weren't doing that last year. Therefore just on probability alone any child going to hospital likely has done a covid test in previous 14 days.
1433692367152893954	@ChipWVTM13 Just a sanity check.  When there was such a thing called the flu, I wonder how many flu-confirmed kids were hospitalized?  Would love to see those numbers to compare to Covid.  Think about that.
1376951340174303236	@Aryan_Sharma05 @quinlanomonlano @MattHancock Look at the small print though. Deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Not all of those deaths are directly related to covid. I hate to use a cliche example, but somebody could test positive, be successfully treated and then he hit by a bus, which would go down as a covid

Suburbs and Chicago at about 90-95% capacity and that was yesterday, haven’t checked today. Like 20% of my HCW colleagues who boosted are out with Covid.Give me a break.
1473122308336365573	@PaulHughes11vic @alexpearsonUK @JeremyVineOn5 You need reading lessons! Where did I say ‘hospital’? Get YOUR facts right before jumping in! Most people in hospital are jabbed - thats because most of the population are jabbed. Comprehend? 10% are not jabbed. More than 10% of Covid patients in ICU (not hospital) are unjabbed.
1340752596018077702	I 100% would get the vaccine. I dont understand why its such a big deal. Covid is terrifying. Ive seen people, Young people. Be hospitalized for covid. It's a bad virus &amp; I will do anything &amp; everything to protect my family &amp; myself from it.
1380168155759280141	@CNN Is Covid really that bad? I tested positive 3 weeks ago and only felt fever and chills.  In like 4 days i was back to normal healthy.
1542974353427628033	@EmmaKennedy My partner caught covid from Glastonbury, we did the same, different rooms, doors open lots of ventilation. Tested positive today!
1527997316891918337	eleven days on from my first positive covid test and I'm still testing positive. this seems fine and normal.(the line's getting fainter and I've been feeling much better since around day five. I'm just side-eyeing the official 'ten days' thing a bit.)
1385700234769149957	@SDinPraxis I didn’t get the long covid, thank God. I did however, have a bit of a reaction to my 2nd jab and I’m being referred to hospital for tests. They reckon it’s covid related, the virus that keeps on giving! 🤪
1381659532569509888	@realTuckFrumper He's correct when you look at how they arrived at their numbers....I know someone right now begin buried tomorrow that fell off his roof, broke his back, had the vaccine in Feb., tested positive for COVID in hospital with no symptoms &amp; is listed as COVID death. https://t.co/tK8L25jT26
1478520411788828680	got covid in october it’s january now and im in the hospital waiting for a brain scan bc my legs r not working properly because of long covid and the migraine/head issues it’s given me. take it seriously bruh this shit fucking sucks
1379906710354153474	I’ll say this.. 78% of the people hospitalized for Covid were obese. Instead of mandating exercise and promoting a healthy diet, we go “Here’s a vaccine, and you get a year’s supply of donuts.” 😑
1479843165649657860	@vankayak Explain then why my spouse was on a stretcher for 3 days in the ER in 2019? There was no beds then. They moved her to a bereavement room after that. Then forgot about her as there was no monitoring capabilities, lock, or buzzer to contact staff. All pre COVID.
1476704943801348099	Do you know of anyone who has died of Covid. In the past two weeks 2 people I knew were hospitalized and improving.  Then suddenly they died. It has been sad.  Very sad.
1526775869741469698	After having to go to the ER for my heart even if it's probably not related to diet (COVID) I'm gonna try this Mediterranean diet recipe thing https://t.co/BsI93Fz1U7
1415025394210721797	@hakyrehc_ I think people who were definitely exposed to covid positive people and waiting on test results make up the isolation numberI could be very wrong tho but i think i saw that somewhere
1340194441101942786	@Sharsma1 @KING5Seattle If this is what you're referring to, research into an experimental COVID vaccine being produced in Australia was abandoned because it caused recipients to have a *false* positive test result for HIV.I don't see that it actually caused increased HIV risk. https://t.co/K0Jky64Rka
1374365305334534147	"@AaronC_48 So I've been told. At least this one was more than four years. When this pandemic exploded, I said quite often: ""Watch... when I end up in the hospital again, it won't be COVID... it'll be my shoulder."" And look what happened."
1377747239511203840	Ya'll. Does anyone understand how unlucky I am? I got vaccinated and then was diagnosed with COVID like 5 days later.
1540637315290353664	You are not losing it. I have refused to attend a breast scan in hospital. Covid cases are rising. I don’t want to get it. I wear an FFP3 mask when i go into a shop. It’s my body and my choice. You take care and keep talking to us. #WearAMask
1478556385315106816	@laineybabyfl @Lilugeor @FLSurgeonGen Ivermectin is safer. So is selenium, niacin, d3, melatonin, quercetin and zinc.This is what my family of four just took to stop the replication of the covid virus we all tested positive for. We all got better in one day.Regeneron should’ve been standard of care, not Remdesivir.
1386866986915975171	@TuckerCarlson you are a disgrace with your news reporting. You think it’s fake. Explain way all the hospitals are bracing for surges with all the relaxation of everything right before holidays? I am an HCW floated into icu saw 20+ covid people die every 12 hr shift January 2021! https://t.co/tBOSyxcAZ9
1616742549032693762	@elonmusk @ScottAdamsSays No vax…. no mask and never had covid positive test… and I work with lots of people…cca 300 per day
1378082791376756746	@ExplorerArts @PulkerMokLFK @TwitterSafety But here's the kicker.... My family doctor thinks it could have been COVID, as she believes the test is a farce with false positive and false negatives.And at one point, a hospital doctor said don't even bother testing me, as he had so little faith in the test.
1437997917105790984	@MEActNOW @Ordinary1World I think he just get diagnosed with COVID?
1473417930989781006	@GrassrootsJill @manyfcdgod @EricTopol So to the OP tweet, how do they distinguish Delta carriers vs Omnicron carriers, you can not tell me that everyone who tested positive for covid 19 is omnicron positive automatically with out further testing.
1458844340755873801	@j_ownby @timburchett I didn’t get my shots until September. Before that, no masks and out in public allll the time. I was within hand-shaking distance of at least 4 people who were diagnosed with COVID and I never got the first sniffle. 🤷‍♂️. Maybe it has more to do with genetics/DNA?
1603552593111879682	@celinegounder @CBSNews @cbsnewspath Very helpful. I’d thought I needed a positive test (day 5 used to be suggested as ideal) &amp; a dx. Treat Covid vs flu though🤔
1520052279096877057	@NoGoodNameLeft9 @feefer2 @EbriusPsittacus @DudeBroCrypto @DrEliDavid I mean seriously how LOW IQ are you! Vaccines are meant to stop transmission! #FullSTOPBreakthrough rates:Polio 0.3% Varicella (chickenpox) 0.04%Covid-19 - 85%(Don’t give me oh but they didn’t go to the hospital BS. They got the C19 the C19 is weakening - vax doesn’t work!)
1375826718863339520	@Mistress__Lucy @Sophie51403248 @burnssl @PoliticsForAlI 45,000 I believe and 5,000 had covid, or a positive PCR test allegedly. So not particularly accurate. But that figure I have was up to 21st January. https://t.co/8FvfyO5weH
1473331635659673609	To the lame stupid hoe in the red truck that’s tryna cut the line to get Covid test….. I hope you test positive.
1381431767849181189	I’m not gonna quote tweet the piece of shit, but if you have a positive Covid test or symptoms and knowing go into a large crowd, like say Wrestlemania? You deserve to never leave your house again until you can respect others. They literally say don’t go if you have symptoms.
1385528101808050176	@TakethatCt @buchanan17 @ammejo1 @JaiKanta22 @SemiMooch @SplinterSimba @WhoObito @The_Ouroboros__ @cole_davesc66 @Mwforhr @ibrushnroll @DanielB59756947 @pocketrocket210 @mjordan73 @crisps2014 @FlatSlugbrains @jennyrickson @90percenters You claimed 130,000 deaths. Still waiting for you to clarify if they are covid only or from a positive test but death from any reason. I'm still waiting for your answer.
1427761386919104513	I never took a covid test... i dont wear mask in Los Angeles which is heavily populated. I never got vaccinated.I have a feeling as soon as i take a test and score positive, they're going to force all this bullshit meds on me.
1476110519908007941	it’ll also help for when i eventually get covid, so i know when to trot on over to the hospital and add to their overwhelming case load 😌
1473309805464985611	I really hate the narrative that the vaccine is the only way not to be hospitalized by Covid…its like they know they’re wrong but they’re doubling down on this misinformation… work on ur immune systems and body and dont rely on an shot Please !!!
1473851075816046596	tested positive for covid. the pain i went through last night and the symptoms i had were some of the worst feelings i’ve had in my life. please get your shots and stay safe
1478894425996726272	I tested positive for COVID today. Very mild symptoms since Monday that I thought might be a sinus headache. Thus far, the vaccine is working. If you haven't already done so, please get vaccinated.
1344646374550360064	@Yeshua_pro_vida I saw an article a nurse got a vaccine and like 2 days later she tested positive for covid 😂 I'm like you're a nurse you're putting the strain of the virus in you. God gave us immune systems for a reason https://t.co/KYdQHEKeS9
1567942244715446274	I haven't yet received today's hospitalization data from Nova Scotia Health, but the dashboard relays that on Tuesday there were 51 people in hospital because of COVID, 10 of whom were in ICU. The ICU numbers recently have been relatively high.
1383017821366484995	was not practical to be followed. For more than a year, the Corona virus did not catch hold of me, but was tested positive after 3 negative RAT in a span of 14 days. Had received one jab of CoviShield too 13 days ago. I am fine healthwise now. But more concerning is that others
1386671585252233217	@talkRADIO @iancollinsuk Ian, I had an urgent referral for a cancer screening, I was told I had to have a covid swab and if it was positive they would have to cancel my appointment, an appointment to see if I had cancer. I paid £15,000 in tax in January, Why?
1486687482573996039	I've managed to do a little bit of house work, exhausted now but happy I achieved something!! I was terrified when i got a positive test because I've seen too much over the last 2 years.. From now on i WILL be looking after myself better, physically and mentally! #covid
1483192308757635078	Very scary to find out someone you care about who isn't vaccinated tested positive for covid, literally been one of my biggest fears all pandemic 😔
1416531149560684549	found out my bestfriend tested negative for covid after having the biggest scare that it would come back positive. Alhamdulillah for everything man
1381373080963006471	lol as much love as I show my phone hasn’t rung since I tested positive for COVID 🤨
1387144850256973824	@davematt88 @SecondGentleman As a side note to my posting I just found out that my EX who lives in Kansas was just admitted to the ICU with COVID. She refused to get vaccinated when she was due.
1379501003721039873	@k_jaydi @Elizabe32413720 Yes it is a bacterial infection but is a form of covid. I had MSRA after a car crash and surgery 15 years ago. Got Covid this Jan and Dr in hospital told me they were linked.
1383751428284448774	@MLevitt_NP2013 That estimate may need to be revised down when the data reveals how many people simply died and tested positive v people who died FROM covid alone. I suspect that the covid only cohort is in the low 10s of 1000s if that due to how deaths are recorded
1480507061834170368	One more hard blow, of course, I feel so. On Monday, 10.01.2021, the #Defence Minister @rajnathsingh has tested Positive for #COVID19. I pray hard, The Almighty, GOD to bless him with a fast and strong recovery. #COVID19India #CovidTesting #CovidVaccine @narendramodi @PMOIndia
1482831624320557056	I want to see a multiple regression analysis looking at the following independent variables and how they contribute to the odds ratio of being admitted to ICU with covid 19: vaccination status, age, medical comorbidities, BMI, on immunosuppressive medication. Thanks!
1603419371971674113	"@creativelies @EffYouJobu @chronicallybeee The person isnt sharing experiences, they're trying to form conclusions (clearly this is due to Covid). This is the same specious reasoning as antivax folks that will be like ""I know someone who got vaccinated and then they went to the hospital with a seizure"""
1544899770942103552	@ThaCrazyBuffalo @BrokenLobo Hoping for the best, fam… all I know is he did test positive for Covid a few days before he went dark.
1481741805209145346	Update: I tested positive, but not when you'd think I would. Settle in for COVID 🧵 number 3.
1479687678471770114	Like 40 students and teachers at my school yesterday positive for Covid 🥴. Only 30% of students have tested in the district.
1458047358621700100	@datta_arvind A fun fact: I was hospitalized for covid in the 1st week of Apr. Having no other task and an entire month's salary, I invested a very big chunk in axis ELSS (bhagwan ka naam leke) , something which I had never done so far. Its almost 30% up as of now.
1439576026334433283	@mattchewlala @KING5Seattle I can’t find the article now but basically there are many people who are not aware they have underlying conditions. Sometimes it takes Covid for them to be diagnosed. If I find the article I’ll post it.
1415080072688537605	Test came back positive for covid 😩 at least I’m already through the worst of it 🥴
1573119055678013442	It was a good run: two and a half years without COVID, but after two days of feeling like death I took a test tonight, and it was positive.Ugh.
1467415705213620234	@MickGinRSC We know very sick people are unable to be vaccinated, because it is too risky for themThere is no evidence at all that those in ICU on ventilators were previously healthy individuals who now have covid, none!I STRONGLY suspect these people have severe underlying health issues
1425625853803827207	@DanBerky I know. Was just frustrated bc ive been reading abt HCW being lectured, screamed at about Covid being a hoax while in the hospital.
1542128228629889027	Everyone in my immediate family tested positive for COVID except me. I masked immediately when I found out one of us had tested positive. It’s been two weeks of wearing a mask and pretty much isolating in my room because the family member I live with doesn’t grasp the concept.
1426618529269403653	As Children's COVID Cases Surge, There's Another Virus On The Rise: a surge in children diagnosed with a combination of COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus. Good grief. If I were religious, I’d say someone is punishing us all because of republicans. https://t.co/GYzi5YSBYD
1377654543643602953	So, I was exposed yesterday to somebody that tested positive. We are getting closer to being done with this...but, don’t let your guard down, we are not out of this yet. @CDCgov #covid #WearAMask
1598178791662448647	@harleybz49 @johnrich It’s totally up to you. As a nurse I see more vaccinated in the hospital with Covid then not vaccinated. Don’t convince yourself it works. It may disappoint you.
1451917371757760515	@rchoutntchsm1 @La78Tomking @notdred All well and good 1% I just had to go to the emergency room for a golf injury the place was packed with Covid patience it’s a person’s choice not the government.  roll the dice if you want.
1460985908837105672	@KeithGullis @SamanthaTaghoy I didn’t say they’re all unvaccinated. I have to be honest national data on vaccination status for those in hosp/ICU/dying is hard to find, if you’ve found it please do share. A significant portion of those dying from COVID don’t come to ICU, typically elderly or very comorbid.
1446466513238626327	@GammaReigh My younger had a classmate text positive for COVID, so she's been at home this week. Fortunately, my girl tested negative. Fingers crossed she's back in person again starting Monday.
1476606179434549251	I tested positive for Covid Sunday because I felt extremely sick all day. I’ve felt fine since Monday. Thankful as hell for the vaccine 🙌🏻
1456717357553004544	@GeorgeHagstrom @AndyHermanNFL I’m a random nobody, fully vaccinated, who tested positive for Covid yesterday and received monoclonal antibody treatments today. You’re wrong
1379446734334664706	Absolutely no way I am going to take two COVID tests a week just because. Especially lateral flow tests. Happy to be tested if I go back into the office, or even to go to the theatre, but I expect to be compensated if I can’t work due to a positive result. 1/2
1472614811007651857	@James882James @LondonWorldCom Either way - you're in hospital.And I wouldn't wish covid on any stroke patient.
1507797424785473540	My nanny caught Covid in hospital. 🤦🏻‍♀️
1581760496822517760	I tested positive for Covid today and this is the worst I’ve ever felt. Everything also tastes like shit.
1475603835930480645	Im wondering what’s in faucet water/pipelines that made that covid test positive…
1437523536533409794	@Rockprincess818 Not one shot. Spent 2 weeks in the hospital in April been back and forth for doc app. Not once have I had covid. Knock on wood.
1374411013664034827	@kaylayoungforwv I know two healthy people who contracted Covid while at CAMC for other medical issues. One died, the other spent a month in the hospital. Staff and/or visitors brought virus in. Providing legal immunity while increasing risk does not inspire confidence.
1453450760285564930	Am I the only one who feels like hospitals workers nowadays truly don’t give a fuck about they job as far as caring for people and helping? You go to the ER now and they literally ignore you. Or only care about Covid.
1477053789773316097	@cactusncookies I have a nephew that's a EMT.  He got COVID 9 months ago, gave it 2 his wife and 1 of his kids,. All were tested, all recovered. A week ago, he came down with it again (very mild symptoms, like allergies), his wife got it again. She is worse, but not enough to be hospitalized.
1482768691020378113	I know somebody who may have covid w 100* fever. She is not vaccinated, but her roommate IS and just tested positive 🤔
1420910352116617220	Not only did I get tested positive for Covid today, but this happens. Rizzo leaving is still the worst news I've received today.
1382629971856748544	I am positive for the covid test
1550111294304292870	So this was a waste of time 🤣because I had covid 7 weeks ago, any PCR test I do now will come back positive from the LAST time I had covid (stays in your system for about 90 days). FORTUNATELY the nurse did say that it was HIGHLY unlikely i would catch it again so quick.
1476534284945084419	I have covid and I’m double jabbed plus I had my booster two days ago. Today I have had symptoms and have done a test which is positive. I currently have a head ache and a achey back. Also feel out of breathe and have a minor cough. Will update on process #COVID19
1538967028345757696	@Dale66845992 I tested positive for Covid @ 67 years of age.  I believe in natural immunity and am a Pureblood.  69 years old now.
1389288243942854656	I don’t know who needs to hear this today, but if you get diagnosed with COVID, please listen to the doctors who have treated this for over a year on which medications you should be taking, NOT a politician who isn’t a scientist.Seriously, it could save your life.
1399382201398022146	@HemantSorenJMM Sir,Step by step kizea,Mask and Social distance par strong rahea.Bahut log bina Covid test ke hi COVID Positive hai and ghar me hai.Abhi E Pass within city hata kar   Random COVID test har jagh jayda se jayda kizea, then Covid negative jayda ho tab unlock me jayda facility degea
1482021001735335937	I have been tested COVID positive today.
1554815345239760897	My case of covid is so brutal. I actually believe if i was over 50 and not completely healthy I would be hospitalized right now. Ive never been so sick in my life. Day 4 of 103°+ fever and my other symptoms have only gotten worse.
1373949400997855235	Been sent home from school because I have to wait to see if my bros Covid test is positive or not nice
1422672083369213953	I now know 2 vaccinated people who tested positive for COVID. One is young and healthy. Wear your masks people. It isn’t over. Take care of yourselves and others. Be nice.
1501632821563215874	@HumzaYousaf How many are in hospitals with a false positive. Someone I know 6 positive LFT and a negative PCR test. Covid is gone stop trying to hang onto the little control you have. It’s the cold and flu season. How about you do the honourable thing and resign.
1466222189317959682	For CoVID, lung and heart function tests are essential diagnostics OF function.After the 2 wks in the ICU and surgery, I couldn't STAND without fainting. So they stress tested me on a tilt-table. I simply didn't have enough red blood cells. WHY I fainted due to lack of oxygen.
1373413651588116486	I tested positive from COVID  in the whole house and nobody else did stfu it’s a lie
1518922385088344064	@kookcove @cptndemocracy64 @richdatasci @GVDBossche @FatEmperor I've only ever seen the TV clip of a shot New Zealander who tested positive for covid.Surely the AE reports in both scenarios would list gunshot as being a possible cause of death?Another concern is where a deceased person tests positive &amp; no autopsy is performed😱
1380081342424158210	@RougeNoirUK As I understand it, the PCR test picks up RNA fragments of an coronavirus, so my guess is that anyone with the fully formed spike protein before the antibodies have been created to attack said protein, might test positive. So a window of opportunity?
1379561365707362306	@_RoughCountry @kcdartexpress yes.  most of my family tested positive for it with more headcold symptoms.  Only 2 of us morphed into bronchitis a week later and 1 of those pneumonia but it was under control.   Thankfully.   There are a lot of common sense measures to treat covid they are not telling you.
1386944966870683649	@_captainscience Yes, I was affected to the extent that I took a Covid test and had a checkup in hospital. I got the all clear but it took over a week to resolve. It wasn’t nice but I’m glad my immune system was doing its thing because it can often be a bit rubbish. 😄
1426810375253766147	Tested positive for Covid on Friday. It feels like I have the flu, everything you get with that you get with Covid. The isolation is going to be hardest part. #covid #isolation
1447670897267994625	@jessforbiden I have 14 family members who contracted Covid19 this passed November, December &amp; January. No one was hospitalized &amp; we were all over it from 5 to 14 days approx. Smell &amp; taste returning for 2 of us took almost a month. TBH it wasn't the worst we have had but is in our top 5!
1375251897263742979	@Jessicam6946 Going for covid test tomorrow. Two different employees I work with tested positive. I am worried but I feel fine.
1489225065308774403	@Wasteofskin2 @POTUS So, just to be sure I am not mistaken… When an American without Health insurances get sick and have to be hospitalized for Covid, for exemple, do they get the bill? 🤔
1374035246019178502	💉 COVID-19 VACCINE: I just got my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine at DCH. I am eligible through the 1C category. I got it because I was so sick with COVID-19 nearly 9 months ago and had to go to the hospital. I knew it was something I never wanted to experience again! @abc3340 https://t.co/Fb9EhiyQLP
1510842268151910402	We switched from our first bar because they were doing the last round at midnight. This new bar is more crowded and I left my N95 in the car. Hope I don't get Omicron. I've never tested positive for covid.
1487609021997719556	@Goreshe Sorry, but you got scammed heavy. No way Covid testing costs anything. It's free at every pharmacy, clinic by me. Even when I went to the ER that shit was free. Nah. Dispute that shit. smh charging for covid testing 😤 lmao
1415747947145400322	@DavidJoBrexit I went to hospital today and was held up by a COVID patient having a cardiac arrest in the corridor while I was standing waiting a Dr told me after the 19th this is going to be terrible I said but the vaccine works he laughed I kid you not
1515913126151032832	@CBCPolitics @RosieBarton I really wish @RosieBarton had the time to challenge @jjhorgan on his claim about COVID outbreaks in schools. BC is doing THE BARE MINIMUM for testing. You have to be hospitalized to get tested. How would they know if there was an outbreak in a school?
1376545750801387526	@Pam19831 @joncoopertweets The ship Captain Cruz said he witnessed a child being tested for Covid and it was positive.  Nice to know he had plenty of time to wait.  I call bs.  Why wasn't he video taping the border when Trump was in office.
1504092706188017668	After successfully avoiding this thing for two years and doing everything right, my 8yo just tested positive for COVID. I am a wreck. #CovidIsNotOver
1380411402247102464	@GMB @kategarraway Thats wonderful news to hear, that kate's husband Derek is back at home after a year being in Hospital due to Covid. Its a Miracle a Pray answered. I'm so happy😂for Kate and the family on this great news. Im so glad Derek is finally back home with his family.
1380276956634173441	@Dr2NisreenAlwan @royalsociety @ProfBrianCox @AdamRutherford Great discussion. Thank you.It's worth mentioning that in the USA the subset of Long Covid patients who meet the criteria for ME/CFS and have PEM as a mandatory symptom, are actually being diagnosed as having ME/CFS after 6 months.https://t.co/AtvI8isg9J
1525228850485121026	@nakedpastor I tested positive for covid a couple of days ago. Fortunately I have a mild case of it which I attribute to be fully vaccinated.
1440708787719917572	At the hospital I tested positive for COVID and had to be held in quarantine at the hospital since I was a danger to myself for 10 days. I was then transferred to the psych unit for 8 days where my meds were adjusted and I had some therapy. I'm home now and feel better atm 7/ 7
1482742194284990466	@quasar9uk @PutrinoLab @julierehmeyer I have 5 positive GPCR autoantibodies. A new dx of POTs, chronic fatigue and many other symptoms not all readily explained by these diagnoses. I took a nucleocapsid test just after symptoms developed (right after vax) to rule out covid. It was negative.
1436396197078388739	@AHS_media My job involves patient care in ICU at PLC and it is concerning to see 2 patients in a room that is made for one.  This is not normal and is directly related to the increase in Covid patients.
1463649994964189186	@StephenKing Just look across the pond, heavily vaccinated countries aren’t doing so well. Maybe Biden should switch direction and remove vaccine mandates. The vaccine does not stop transmission. If you want me to sign a waiver saying I won’t go to the hospital if I get covid, I will.
1472357293459066882	People will say such and such got Covid and died or almost died. I will say I know they did. They went to Hospital didn’t they!? You will say yes. I will say that’s the trick. Homeless don’t die of Covid. Remdesivir kills people and reckless doctors kill people.
1379994866541850628	@SIDPharm A8: my pitch isn’t the nicest but I did tell my grandba if you get COVID I really think you will at least make it to the ICU, the vaccine won’t likely send you to the ICU. He got vaccinated.
1486834445558501379	Kenney says they have 1363 covid patients in hospital, then corrects himself “or I should say, patients *with* covid”. He says the ‘overall burden in hospitals is stable.’ WTH????  Isn’t it because dozens of people are dying every week.
1586399365446656001	@ScottPaulissen @ElizaCharley I have long suspected I have hEDS. When I was in my 20s I brought it up to my Dr, he said he didn't believe in EDS. Other things he didn't believe in: fibro and CRPS. Now I'm in my 30s, have been struggling with Neuro long covid almost 2yrs. I finally got diagnosed with POTS..
1400481799420088321	@MonicaGandhi9 This past weekend i couldn't even visit by partner in the hospital for emergency surgery, despite us both being fully Vaccinated, due to their idiotic 1x visitor per day COVID policy at Kaiser.  Mama got there before me.
1480862111140089857	@Michael17064609 @MestizoBobbyHil @bylenasun @ScottGottliebMD @CDCgov @rachel_roubein I *might* believe this of “people hospitalized for COVID pneumonia”, or even conceivably “people with symptoms severe enough to seek medical attention” (while noting that there’s going to be a hell of a reporting bias there).
1503657214342414337	Get well soon kim kai 😔 My real and virtual bf both tested positive COVID today 😭
1384643986971897857	I was wondering, if you test positive for covid and you're vaccinated what are the chances that it's a false positive?  I made assumptions [50% vaccinated, 95% efficacy, 1% currently infected, false positive rate 0.5%] but I'm too chicken to share my math. I got ~1 in 5 chance?
1490344041535488006	@alphagal_info I got COVID on January 15th and it flared up everything making my symptoms worse.  Hopefully it will calm down soon.  I have SVT and I keep having runs also  I still wander if the SVT and alpha Gal are related as I was diagnosed around the same time.

1377800258063831043	@TheColorGreen11 That makes me so angry. “Not good stewards.” The good stewards are busy voluntarily  walking into ICU rooms and shutting the glass door behind them...while they care for critically ill COVID pts. Give them the PPE and support to do it safely. Period.

1377498712944050176	@MattHaneySF Me and my gf both have covid right now and even tho she was fully vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine, she still tested positive and has to quarentine. I know this is only anecdotal but still seems like they're jumping the gun on this one
1485330444191252486	I guess that 102F fever on Friday was more than just a random cold. Tested positive for COVID :/ I'm so gd upset right now.
1405202750460289030	“But where is the proof that I can get Covid still if I’m vaccinated Tee?” Proof is in the hospital. Proof is in ground. “Just bc you’re nurse, doesn’t mean you know everything.” Yea ur right, but I believe in what I’ve seen and the facts. —Tee
1459540869930000390	Went Pricesmart and saw someone in the car park who I know tested positive for covid last week. Man ain't even get cleared to go back to work but you outside. Then we wanna know why we in this mess.
1531253218977755138	I think it's similar to how the Flu acts. Each year we count all the people who get the flu by those who get tested and are positive. However, a big majority get it, have mild symptoms, don't get tested. Also, some people die from the Flu. Just more kids die from Flu than COVID.

1432894841537630208	@Cernovich A statistic I'm looking for if anybody can help. What percent of people vaccinated had already had covid symptoms or tested positive positive for covid in the past. Cannot find this stat.
1467979802900451329	@kevinwoodward I don't think vaccination data by zip code is available, but I'll see if I can find anything. We do know that ~90% of those hospitalized for covid in Larimer County aren't vaccinated. Loveland's case count per 100k for 10/6-12/6 is ~27% higher than Fort Collins'.

1422762323098279939	@Kent83Kevinin @LasVegasLocally Cases matter because the more people with Covid, the more who will get severely ill and die. Also, the article is referencing hospitalizations, not overall cases. I don't know anyone who wants to end up in the hospital even if they don't die. Grow up.
1611034806598664194	@shnecks77 @igorsushko What attention does it need?  I've currently only one relation in hospital (She's 95). Hospitals in China are busy, I'm told by those that know less busy than expected.  Everyone I know in China has had COVID in the last weeks. Somewhere between 0.5-1M old people are going to die
1465436773786525704	@davidjware @rageofthecat @jonboldted @JennaEllisEsq I beg to differ. I went to the gym at least 5 days a week for the last 10 years. Got Covid and spent 21 days in the hospital. COVID could care less if you’re healthy.

1468883851925618690	@Trumpeteer14 If the test did work (which I doubt) you would test positive because in an early addition of The American Medical Association  under virus covid is listed as a common cold.

1388917906814246914	@blitzburgh6 Gotcha. I know we’ve been advised that it’s recommended you don’t get the vaccine until at least 3 months post positive COVID test so I was just curious about the TL of yours.  So many variables to this, it’s just crazy.

1367550800520740865	An idiot I know had the opportunity to get the vaccine over a month ago and refused because he “didn't  know what was in it.” He tested positive for covid last weekend and is now experiencing all the symptoms.
1379069097426747392	@ByYrSide Having the flu vaccination does the same thing as in doesn't protect us fully from flu. Plus this vaccination makes it less likely that I end up in hospital which with my comorbidities I'd surely die from Covid.

1371637799137509376	If I test positive for Covid recover and die within several weeks of recovery my death is still recorded as Covid. If I have the vaccine and die several weeks after it’s down to natural causes. Hmmmm
1474192148664782848	I just found out how much my hospital bill was when I was in the ER for covid 😶 I want to cry
1532462952925863936	my whole family tested positive for covid but i didn’t 😌 that feels funny bc they always be telling me that i’d be the one to catch it bc my immune system sucks
1428814341407653891	My husband is in hospital with COVID, double pneumonia, and low 02 saturation. He had minor surgery on Wednesday, and caught it at the facility. Kids &amp; self negative so far. Please, please remember him in your duas, get vaccinated, and wear a mask.
1606806609820356609	@mattbc @HHSGov After avoiding COVID for years, I tested positive this morning, too. Still not sure how I got it. Started paxlovid this afternoon.
1386077072347607045	@NursingNotesUK had the same sentiment back in the philippines. we'd have many deaths a day in the emergency room cuz ambubags out of commission. city gov't corrupt/ full of red tape &amp; haven't got replacements sorted for 3 months. traumatic &amp; i can't imagine going through the same w/ covid
1401198374519414786	@SwapnilRajput77 @GioJoseph5 @livnletliv27 @ANI I mean the same 5cr test are conducted  but positive cases are less but somehow last month dead bodies of covid patients found floating in ganga
1462797208122765315	hey y’all i really hate to be doing this but there is a big Covid outbreak in my city rn and someone i live with just tested positive and i’m not sure if i’m gonna be able to work for a while. please please if you can send money to /ka63l on PayPal or @Kabel-Blowers on Venmo tysm
1418528453364797443	I don’t get it, I was in contact with someone who has now been tested positive.I’ve had both vaccines, I’ve done a flow test which shows I’m negative, I have no symptoms, but I still have to self isolate for 7 days? #Covid19UK #COVID19 #COVID
1568396466552709121	@OliverMoy I tested positive for Covid yesterday, I’m like 99% sure I got it @ playlist😪Feel better soon❤️
1548204446265405440	Look how much better off we would have been under Hunt as PM back @ the start. Ok I don’t agree with just ‘leaving covid +ve people there’ but definitely segregating hospitals between covid &amp; non covid sites, segregating staff, &amp; treating more of the covid +ve in hospital = good?
1376969980261072896	@PrisonPlanet Wait, I think I get it. Is this because 80% of Covid patients in the hospital are obese? Perhaps they could just limit the plate sizes instead? #followthescience
1428488575440457731	"@InOkanagan @EpsilonTheory Canadian numbers are BS. I know nurses at Sunnybrook, St.Mikes &amp; McKenzie. Dig thru the Ontario data and you'll see the hospitalizations are labelled ""with covid,"" because everyone is diagnosed with covid when the test has a 95% error rate."
1387152713775996929	Having covid initially was horrible but as I’m in the hospital being treated for it properly I feel a little better a day
1328761367894036482	I need a huge western road trip - seven states to fill the bucket - but they're all at like 45% positive COVID test rates.  I guess I'll wait for a vaccine shot.  Any thoughts?
1529763572389228546	Hey y’all so I did text positive for covid and I’m thinking it’s from megacon if you did go last weekend pls get tested! Even if you think it’s not because I thought I was just having allergies since my meds worked but I checked just in case
1372641651626291218	@MDHealthDept @GovLarryHogan  That’s Good news Governor.  I’m 67 (Phase 1-C), with 3 underlying health issues I cannot visit a mass vaccination site to due to mobility issues and none of the nearby pharmacies I can’t even register.  Of course I don’t hospitalized if I get COVID
1597940236717555712	@ProfessorLou1 @Douglasrobb4637 Agree 😢 I was fortunate Feb-2020 to find @LoriShemek on Twitter after my 1st SARS-COV-2 infection. Her Enhanced Mitochondria Protocol includes super doses of D3 + other OTC vitamins/supplements that helped me beat death in 2nd infection in ICU Aug-2020 and Long Covid ever since.

1400213458281549833	@talkRADIO @THEJamesWhale @virtualash I had COVID &amp; recovered! I tested positive for antibodies! That’s why I’m not having the jab! And don’t forget that a small percentage of people have died after having the jab so would you be happy to have that on your conscience if you were forcibly jabbing everyone?! 🤔

1447010946937880580	@buffetjay @LiquidUte @I_the_Person @EWErickson Well they can’t say the vast majority of hospitalizations are unvax Covid if they don’t test for Covid in the vaccinated.Had a Covid + unvaccinated going to the ICU I took this morning.Cause for hospitalization was being ejected from a car crash and had a massive brain bleed.

1367078370304008193	I had my Covid vaccine 6 days ago.I suffered with all of the side-effects, it seems &amp; then yesterday I decided to have a Covid test because I couldn’t taste anything.This morning I tested positive for coronavirus.
1401557304743403522	thinking of my lola (she survived covid !!!!!!!!) tonight.. how i wasn’t even able to visit or take care of her in the hospital. we all deserve so much better than this government’s failed pandemic response. tangina talaga we will never be done grieving as a nation
1457541602902114304	@TheRickyDavila @NFL If 30% of the people hospitalized for COVID where I live weren't completely vaxed, you'd have even more of a point, but yeah, there is a racial double standard for everything.
1394479610629287938	@Dustie_Doll I know someone who went to the hospital because they had appendicitis. They got their first Covid vaccine a few weeks ago, so I looked it up and in the studies some people got appendicitis after the vaccine. Not sure if this is case, but we will never know.
1439222796236648451	@SuePersists @WajahatAli Israel has an 85% vaccination rate yet has one of the highest infection and death rates from Covid. Four out of five people hospitalized in Israel have been vaccinated. So tell me how the vaccine works? 👉🏼https://t.co/tHhZY1Yfw1
1517675754875543552	@rels11 @lollyfoot In my school district kids can return ANYTIME after testing positive if their “symptoms are resolving”.  Not gone. No negative test needed. Can I just say we continue to have as many Covid positive cases as we did a few months ago.
1473885778229014533	Lo sisi ngi hlekisana naye tested positive for covid and I’m also not feeling 100 🙆🏽‍♂️
1374125368035057666	@grxcealsina i was diagnosed with GERD like a month ago. it happens when you get an upper respiratory infection (covid). i lost 20 pounds and was super sick until i had a scope done, could not eat anything and had no appetite. got new meds and i feel 10x better.
1378885430007971841	@TSN_Sports @incarceratedbob @DarrenDreger Scary situation.   Guy just described my hangovers when I was in my 20s.  Not sure I would call that sever symptoms for Covid.  Not downplaying it but maybe we should reserve “severe” when they need oxygen supplements or in hospital
1476294821446836227	@pulte I just tested positive for Covid. Anything could help. $KeyGellin
1527701483361165319	Broke down a bit in the parking lot of a @kpthrive Covid testing. Having to put my 6 mo through that test was how I imagined my week to end. But on the positive I just watched my 2yo run holding her lil butt to the potty and go by herself!😻The bad and good of #parenting
1431324565012197376	@OriginTemplar @CryptoLilze @WanderingWare If she tested positive to Covid, she would have antibodies. I’ve heard of others whose family had Covid and they never got it during that time. But some got it months later. We have had crews interact together in groups of 50 and one would end up positive and others not.
1553014935642185728	@ehforgetit My first home test was negative, but then I did a PCR b/c all of my symptoms screamed Covid, and it was positive. Covid sucks. I hope you feel better soon.
1434331100004880391	oh no another enhypen member tested positive for covid? i hope they all get better immediately ☹️
1433831815148621827	@Here_Existing_J @DrEricDing I guess we should all just make decisions based on your anecdotal evidence? If you are a kid you have a .0005% chance of going to the hospital because of covid. That’s not even 1 kid per several school districts. Stop pretending, stop virtue signaling, it just makes u look bad
1311763177865183232	@emmakennytv I’m not against vaccines but why would anyone have this covid vaccine when it has been pushed out without enough clinical trials. My husband and I tested positive for covid 19 my husband has lots of underlying health problems and we have both fully recovered. So definitely NO....
1421272534708785163	welp, we just got our covid test results in order to travel next week and... there was one positive result and one negative resulted btwn April and I.
1376882737081114628	Well, guess it's my turn. Got the call from the hospital a little bit ago. Tested positive for covid. So I'll be quarantining in my bedroom, at my desk on the play station.....
1477850376196038659	@DeniceAllHeart @IsabellaMDeLuca I am unvaxxed. I have had covid 3 times. Didn't drink any bleach. Didn't eat any horse dewormer.  My girlfriend got vaxxed and got sick from the vaccine. Got sick from the booster. And she still tested positive for covid twice.  But tell me more... 🤡🤡🤡🤡
1397513550621462529	@RealMattCouch @SeanTho98192182 Thank God!! I had to use the @ChildrensHD and @RobertKennedyJr mask/covid test forms yesterday to keep child in school. I'd love to follow/keep updated on this litigation.  Conn has 18 hospitalized!
1438614689257230339	@arpizzy Vaccination isn’t equal total immunity it’s equal a more prepared immune system, the people who contracted Covid after vaccination barely had any symptoms, and some of the ones I know when tested and were found negative after 10 days of the positive test instead of the 14 days
1479490628987899913	@jasonleitch hi there, just throwing a suggestion out there, I am a GP and also work in hospital medicine, so aware of staffing issues, why not move covid pos pts to the Louisa Jordan &amp; staff it will covid pos (mild symptoms) staff that would otherwise be isolating.
1460283271858769923	@mjinko_ie @KeithMillsD7 Sure, I'm just trying to get to the numbers.If 1000 people are vaccinated and get covid, x will be hospitalized.If 1000 people are unvaccinated and get covid, 6x will be hospitalized.I want to know what x is because 6x is being presented as significant.
1386727487862935556	@celliottability I don’t want anyone else to die from COVID, but we know that’s not going to happen, because you are Doug Ford’s puppet and don’t know how to use you brain. But if you won’t quit, I hope one of your family members get COVID and ends up in the ICU.
1373692807785947139	Had to work today. My opener for the weekends went to Vegas last weekend and then tested positive for COVID on Thursday. WEAR YOUR F-ING MASKS and don’t go to places like Vegas that probably aren’t following social distancing.
1467544858516762635	No, however, I have had to work in the hospital with patients who die from COVID without realizing they had the power to protect themselves from dying. They refuse to believe the science, because of fear and lies!
1430618199234531328	My COVID test came back positive today… positive that WAGMI‼️
1420103201592954886	@jefd12 I agree 100%. A health care worker told me that the test come back positive or negative only. They do not have a label of variant attached to them. How does anyone know what form of Covid they may or may not have?
1449530398791241733	@jackie__AK Covid can take up to a week to show itself on tests after being exposed. Hence you could test negative two or three times and then show up positive. That's why the quarantine. It sucks and I'm sorry you have to go through it.
1603824951307517952	Lidocaine liquid and misdiagnosed me with a Viral URI.The next day(sunday) test results come back, positive covid, negative everything else.Monday I call my PCM and leave a message, This is the second day, no treatment plan from anyone.By Tues still no call back from PCM4)
1531740267786686465	Has anyone had COVID but never got a positive rapid test? I’d swear it’s just mild allergies except I have one swollen lymph node. :/
1364247957629931522	@staceys5551 I had the moderna vaccine. It's had to determine what the effects were for the first dose since I started showing covid symptoms the same day I got the shot, then got a positive covid test not long after. The 2nd shot just left a sore spot on my arm.
1519080755095289857	Not how I pictured my birthday going but here we are 🤷‍♂️ Flew to Austin and immediately tested positive for Covid 🙃 Each day has been a little better and today, kicked off a new adventure with @atmosphere_tv 🚀 Excited to help grow their new sports channel 📺 https://t.co/r5X83PxJiX
1528080692894175234	@GBNEWS I think she's tested positive for more than Covid...lunacy leaps to mind!
1490421584649142275	A guy I worked with all last week. Tested positive for covid this morning. The good thing I will not have to train the new guy. Other good news is . I get to do the guys job that will be out. I love his job. The thing is I have worked around so many people that has been sick
1446467981056303106	@RWMaloneMD Fun fact: Between 100-200 United States Congress Members (plus many of their staffers &amp; family members) with COVID.. were treated by a colleague over the past 15 months with ivermectin &amp; the I-MASK+ protocol at https://t.co/nsTSsXtcgd. None have gone to hospital. Just sayin'
1439903836559249409	@chrisrock It’s awful!  I don’t know if I had it, but the second shot destroyed me for 24 hrs.  Awful full body pain.  I couldn’t imagine dying from covid or being hospitalized for weeks w/ it. Praying!!!!  For anyone &amp; all🙏
1380044487838212098	@surbalu @rajinikanth @soundaryaarajni It’s hurting me also bro . Covid is peak . Why to risk his life just for a shoot that too he got admitted to hospital becoz of shoot last time
1419086876636598273	@catturd2 I'm not surprised as coca cola, kiwi fruit &amp; a goat have also tested positive. CDC is withdrawing PCR for 'covid testing' as cannot differentiate nor diagnose.
1387353812277600257	@cary_northrop @SekeltheAwesome I worked with patients in ICU with a history of crohn's who were ravaged by covid.
1337400372093181956	I spent a week in the ICU at tge Cleveland Clinic. I recovered with physical therapy, using a walker and a cane. I cannot take a flu shot EVER AGAIN because next time it may kill me. I likely will not b able to get the Covid vaccine.
1354832161761865730	Why do all normal doctors appointments end up with me having to go to the hospital to be monitored. On the bright side I’m getting my covid vaccine today.
1312050148990758919	Make me skeptical as to whether or not Trump actually tested positive.  Maybe this is just more bullshit so Trump can show that his #Hydroxychloroquine, a phony #vaccine, or injecting bleach is the cure to #COVID19.
1459193125923139589	@jswMAGA @TheHoyt08 @JesseKellyDC I know 22 people diagnosed with Covid.21 have lived and an 86 yr old who had Pneumonia complications R.I.P.12 of those 22 are now vaccinated,1 is gone.1 is disabled for good.1 had a reaction so bad they were instructed not to get a 2nd shot.Can I tell my truth in 2021? https://t.co/17Nf7I9hVR
1484989654159945730	Was going to Texas to see my family and they all just tested positive for covid 🤦🏾‍♀️🥺
1507745728478777349	What are they gonna do with all the Covid internment camps? I know, why not convert them to hospital beds seeing as we just destroyed an entire generation's future presumably coz there weren't enough of them to go around?#Covfefe1984#BranchCovidians #WakeTheFuckUp https://t.co/hu7V9PWoJK
1375124648019566592	@jillrock12 I typically speak to the COVID hospital census, which is everyone currently hospitalized with COVID. Hospitals throughout the state submit their COVID patient counts each day and the the Ohio Hospital Association compiles those counts. D/D = day over day &amp; W/W = week over week...
1381817420843773952	@CBSNews theoretically, every other state is going through it. it's just the vaccinations have kept it from becoming a severe covid #atrisk cases. so it isn't getting diagnosed.i wonder if rural areas, because exposure might be less and so immune systems beat it off.
1386321671733366787	@SaraGio15 @LilRedRooster I legit saw a guy on a local group state that covid wasn’t that bad even though his wife spent two weeks in the ICU on a vent.  He was arguing against masks and distancing
1442754624193122305	@SClarified It’s because more are being vaccinated and getting Covid then giving it to others. I’m hearing about people who got Covid then tested positive again after the shot. This is so bizarre.
1437895482798481414	I was sick bad for one day, today i feel much better. But they still said I tested positive for Covid. I can still taste and smell. Wasn't that like the largest indicator of Covid?
1512094344924307465	@ACanadianYeti @Sflecce @ACEPOntario @OPSBA @CatholicEdu @AFOCSC Oh I am so sorry! We have a nephew in the hospital now with asthma  who contracted covid at school . 4yrs old.

1578143809510469632	Meanwhile, I was just informed that my gran who was admitted to hospital a month ago with a heart attack is now on a COVID lockdown ward, and apparently some of the members of my family are on their xth time getting COVID. (I lost count for them).
1375130733736554505	Got my first does of Covid vaccine today, and then fucking tested positive for Covid 2 hours later. WHY!!!
1437145676257898501	@Swissarmyguy @csuka072 @DerbyB11 @billonesty Hey you. Stop BITCHING. It’s my fucking choice to not get vaxed and if you don’t like it suck a cock. You’re not going to see me or anyone else I know that’s unvaxed going to the hospital for COVID. Seriously stop being such a fucking crybaby and man up. I like my freedoms

1438257782692720641	@thisappiswild @flossyflange @ToryRambo That's why I said the figures need looking at. Why were they in hospital?Same as those who died 'within 28 days' of a test needs looking at.With covid OR from covid.With the jab OR because the jab didn't work  'Just gimme some truth' as John Lennon wrote.
1401621060529885193	@LarcombePeter @ClarkeMicah I have certainly come across medics like you in the NHS, I care not a jot for your intimidating tone, I chose to support a simple fact, positive test do not equate to ‘cases’ . I believe our NHS has, because of poor investment and scarce resources, become a N. Covid service.
1373883123130327041	The Fact that I know people who personally died last year working for Amazon and thousands of there workers have tested positive and continue still to contract Covid this is beyond disgusting PR idk nothing about this YouTuber but no amount of clout  https://t.co/s4q7axf8wW
1356242645044092928	@andyatticus90 @_JackH2 @spencermorgan93 Like I said I've seen what bollocks they tell us take covid away its pneumonia covid is just what they say to add numbers and keep the place locked down why do you think they put deaths if tested positive in 28 days but now 60 days 🤔 maybe the vaccine
1527121221371961345	@FPWellman Looks like classic white privilege to me. Let’s see how fast he runs to the hospital when his azz gets infected with covid.

He went into the hospital with covid.  3 weeks later they put him on a ventilator.  3 weeks later he died. When I called to speak to him I asked the nurse about therapeutics and was told the vaccines were the only preventative 1/2
1436437756767518722	@kaymariex0x0 @POTUS It will protect you from getting really sick or dying of COVID. An overwhelmingly high amount of the people in the hospital today are unvaccinated (around 85% I don’t have the exact #). That means the vaccinated folks are relatively okay.
1412088842719539206	@rebslogan @Katohough Thanks for sharing the story it's good to hear from people like me not tested in March and not poorly enough to be admitted to hospital. Its been a rollercoaster ride on this #longcovid journey.
1463213517931118597	@wtfmig Don’t worry! If you take enough covid tests you’ll eventually test positive! I believe in you!
1476279430129586180	@saltysixties I spent Christmas Day in the hospital, I tested positive for COVID, I started coughing on Friday and went to the hospital and it came out positive, I believe I got it from my supervisor, I feel okay just a slight cough, so I’m isolated for 10 days, take care of yourself
1376513902729699328	A year ago, life was very uncertain for these two. Both hospitalized with COVID, and things weren’t looking great. Our family couldn’t be together, and hadn’t been since Christmas 2019. Saturday we celebrated my Papa’s 80th birthday TOGETHER. ❣️ https://t.co/ZZPt4x1F2o
1488425481598865408	Sighs. Day 5 of Daddy Covid watch. He’s still positive. Feeling bit deflated as we were hoping he’d be ‘free’ with a day 5 and day 6 negative test. I howled and did a mega scratch outside his bedroom door this morning. This is getting boring.
1386670785822085127	"@timfarron And there was no context for it. My Mum goes to hospital every couple of weeks for an certain issue but in between she enjoys a full, active life.

1384892832637407232	2 weeks ago today I tested positive for Covid, 1 day before I was to get my first vax shot. Today I’m mostly over it. A little cough remains but that has improved over the days. For only a mild case this thing still sucked. One day was terrible and a few were less than great.1/2
1373993035189604355	When you test positive for COVID they tell you to quarantine, but when a college basketball player tests positive, they don't send them on a bus to Dallas? Show me how that makes sense?
1617595597170823168	@somegal446 Nope.  I do however personally know (or knew) two people who died from Covid and two more who were seriously ill from Covid (hospitalized and intubated) before the vaccines became available. And I know one who died from Covid after refusing to get vaccinated.

1472441062287294464	Hey ya’ll — I tested positive for COVID. I was at For the Children both days and the after party on Saturday. I also was at Gracie Barra Glendale on Tuesday 12/14. If we ran into each other, please go get tested. https://t.co/rdSOb8C9iB
1374416472173211661	"@casewrites UGH. I'm so sorry. There's nothing to say but it sucks. I lost my godmother yesterday who ""recovered"" from covid in February and spent the next 6 weeks in the hospital/rehab but had a heart attack on Sunday. She didn't die ""of"" it... but most definitely ""because"" of it. A waste."
1485491742443175936	oh my gosh so many artists diagnosed with covid these days 😭😭😭😭 i hope they will come back stronger soon and gws 😭😭😭😭😭
1463391095102984193	but I don't know if it would have mattered. The poor man was losing his mind &amp; I tried to rescue him by the 6th wk. By then, he had picked up COVID while in the hospital. I was prepared to take care of him at his home, in quarantine. However, I got there too late...
1529435432051777536	@WookieJon I sat In the ICU a month before Covid -19 came to earth…Thoughts and prayers were appreciated and Worked better than any amount of Funding or “action”
1484764956516323328	I tested positive for Covid.Normal fever hai N Ready for this trendBB15 TROPHY AWAITS KARAN
1374799379144523787	@Treysouls i deadass got diagnosed with covid last monday and its been horrible lmao what do they mean that shit dont exist, i had it and it sucked and i only had mild symptoms
1420708389215096839	#factcheck #GetVaccinatedNow vaccination reduce the risks of getting worse and getting free admission to the hospital. I don’t think you want to be hospitalised for months with Covid. Please get vaccinated if you can. https://t.co/eUXUbjg2aN
1432923938342932489	@GardenerMinOne @rpcounat It does protect - you won’t get as sick ending up in ICU, which is much more preferable. I don’t think either of us would want to die in ICU. It is a personal decision but should be made with a generosity of spirit towards others. Hospitals all over the world are battling COVID.
1475820578011496452	@ForwardMyCalls @CalebHowe @scottlincicome They are getting Covid but they aren't being hospitalized or dying. If you can't acknowledge this basic, immutable fact then you are a dishonest person and not worth another moment of my time.
1431621232466739212	I just saw a neurosurgery PA who told me she’s working full time in her neurosurgery job AND VOLUNTEERING in the emergency room treating COVID patients (in her “spare time”). I hate to imagine her treating a Caleb Wallace but she would.
1443333366367932421	Fun fact:Those pulse/o2 sensors they pop on your finger in the hospital are in drastic shortage due to COVID 19.Here's a test batch to see if I can fix themHere's hoping https://t.co/LcIr7zPs5Z
1517923570818580482	Bad news folks… even though I have been self-isolating from my covid positive husband for 6 days I have finally tested positive for covid. I still don’t have any symptoms and I am ready to resist them using my own willpower should they appear. Pray for a bitch
1487034314374238208	I tested positive for covid 👍🏻
