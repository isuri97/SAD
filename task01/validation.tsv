Anyone who suffers for more than 28 days before dying is considered to have died ‚Äúafter Covid‚Äù.  Not sure how they measure deaths ‚Äúof/from covid‚Äù	0

1346903396729708552	Had the second dose of Covid-19 vaccine today.  I hope any symptoms will be as absent after this dose as they were after the first dose three weeks ago.

1372905327025348610	@tsrandall @StevenTDennis It was easier to do that early on when older ppl were the only vaccinated group and thus trackable.The other group that has very high back rate is health care workers (early access to vax), and I can say in hospital settings, staff covid cases have plummeted.	0

1373366502821404675	@GeorgeJulian @TorButlerCole These events terrify me. I‚Äôd have to be with J 24/7 if he were admitted to hospital for anything. His support worker had a hospitalised client &amp; the hospital fought against having person‚Äôs support worker on the ward (and this was pre covid). It makes no sense for so many reasons.	0

However, the #LongCovid cohort I am curious about would have not been admitted to the hospital (would have had mild or no #COVID sx) due to a robust immune response i.e. young women/children.	0
1387858253464457218	Being fully vaccinated means I‚Äôm much less likely to get COVID, but it also means if I do get COVID I‚Äôm much less likely to get hospitalized or die. Hence, I‚Äôm more comfortable taking risks.Bottom line: vaccination is awesome!	0

1305869925488222209	Am I misunderstanding this Covid Testing.  Surely if you have a test and are negative, you could be positive within a few days/weeks.  Would have thought only a #Vaccine will tackle this #CovidPandemic - and the Government shouldn't rush into that without adequate trials.	0

1374554733357248512	Yeah the Habs planned for two of their players to test positive for Covid. Give me a break man. This wasn't a set up. This was bound to happen. No team is immune from having games called off cuz of Covid.	0
1339728308469174272	@4evercookie81 Good Q! Studies are unclear how long natural immunity lasts (i.e. immunity by getting COVID vs. vaccine), so until we know more you'll probably still want to get the vaccine. If it helps, people who had previously tested positive for COVID-19 were included in clinical trials.	0

1378691922827608064	@nymattregan On the margins, I guess there will be a few vaccinated people who get severe Covid and are hospitalized. And keeping prevalence very low will reduce that, and vaccine passports are a tool for that. But we have to assume these are very small numbers.	0

1365674189026447364	@SimonZena1 @ImaniRutherford @WSJ I would have replied, I hope not. But my boss an Teacher Administrator took the vaccine last month got her second dose a week ago. Yesterday she tested positive for Covid and is home on quarantine. This makes the second time she has had it.	0
1353420217691500544	Just approached by the New York Times. Despite UK Gov narrative, BAME people DO understand #COVID as a risk &amp; are NOT all anti-vaccine. My bro &amp; sis are now both in hospital w/Covid. Both mitigated against risk &amp; were desperate for the vaccine. The prob is higher BAME exposure.	0
1374032980595798018	@TheDamageReport Because she's definitely a very real reliable source herself who checks all the things before she tells people. She's my GP. Last week, she told me I tested positive for COVID, but we cured it by cutting off my feet and yelling into the stumps to scare it out of my head.	0
1388553540453425162	@SandraAHoffman @drmjgilchrist @Outlier1952 Sorry! I thought you were diagnosed at 16. I‚Äôm pretty sure I also have comprehension issues. Covid has a twisted way of getting the truth out. It‚Äôs so hard for me sometimes to wonder, what if someone had seen this or that when I was a kid? I know it‚Äôs pointless.	0

1382489330917253123	@DrTomFrieden My own family physician caught COVID and was sick for a month. He was hospitalized and put on oxygen. Fortunately, he survived.	0
1335633829890060288	@stephmsheets @AutumnRenaeMBA @blackfemmesoul @DeeLaSheeArt I‚Äôve never been tested for flu but have been diagnosed with the flu many times (even when having vaccine). I went to ER last month and got tested for Covid when I went in for something that had nothing to do with flu. Numbers are inflated in comparison to regular flu due to	0
1328113127599247362	@Brexit_si_watp @Salajayne Im 51, I didn't know anyone who's had Covid it until today when my next door neighbour rang to say both him and his wife have it. She has been taken to hospital with Pneumonia. They're both in their 70s, bless them. I felt sad that they were so near to having the vaccine.	0
1376454705669419008	@RosamundUrwin @lucyabeavis @stu_fraser Im a hv &amp;there is a delay in hospital admission notifications from hospital to us.often we don't know until weeks https://t.co/WLhSgc0pBn‚Äôs very frustrating.Covid has impacted us massively looking after 400-1000 families per hv.Mostly safeguarding too.Hope u &amp; ur babba are wellüíú	0
1376189220755243014	Tested positive for Covid. The funny thing is I don't feel sick. Only symptoms of Covid I have is the lack of smell and taste.	1
1348521758387822592	Have just tested positive for COVID-19 despite having received first dose of Pfizer vaccine and my second dose was delayed. Now I am going to be another Health Professional absent from work when services are running short. Feeling deeply disappointed and frustrated.	1
1377264876884787203	"@GeoRebekah Color me surprised. Texas is same as Justices of the Peace (most who don't have any medical background) make final call if people died ""from Covid"" even after tested positive.https://t.co/2cCtAGXFS1"	0
1378338193121107974	Hopefully you won‚Äôt catch Covid. If you do and end up in hospital, would you not regret not having it? Most of my family are in medical profession and they have told me the suffering people go through. Have a good Easter	0
1382395738454364163	@CarCarr5 I know somebody who died from Covid19. At least, that's what his birth certificate says.He was 53 years old, obese, and had diabetes. He went into the hospital to have his leg amputated because of his diabetes. He died in recovery from Covid19, according to the hospital.	0
1384361216336859136	@ceolaf @DLeonhardt I mean I would expect it would account for the vast vast majority of them given that severe COVID means that a person would be hospitalized and thus likely tested immediately.	0
1378114577431359492	The nice thing about a mask is that you can stare at someone with your jaw agape and it's your own business. I looked at her - overweight, Hispanic, working in the service industry, all of which put her at greater risk of ending up in the ICU with COVID.Or the morgue.	0
1372650264566583299	"‚ÄúI ended up in hospital with Covid. This gave me opportunities to tell several nurses that there were people praying for me all around the world, and explain something of what that says about God's family, the church.""https://t.co/9o2la81F96"	0
1379907189737938946	@GingerGano Only had test for antibodies when I had blood drawn for yearly physical. Negative. Zero covid tests, no vaccine. I am in the highest positive county in NY (Rockland) and maybe the country ? And I never stopped going to work, not for 1 week.	0
1373270082122563589	@UKCovid19Stats Am I right in thinking a lot of the over 80's tragically dying now are ones that have been in ICU on ventilation for quite a while? Or is it from the 1% of over 80's who have chosen not to be vaccinated	0
1352385548535652353	It‚Äôs kinda poetic that I‚Äôve gone through the thick of Covid in the hospital, helping the sickest patients since March... and now that I was offered a vaccine, and denied it of course .. I am now bed ridden with Covidü§Ø	0
1376544082009411586	@Dr2NisreenAlwan What % of kids are suffering from long covid there in the UK? Here in the US I am seeing very little on it and we have 3.34 million kids who have tested positive &amp; climbing. US is trying to reach herd immunity by vaccinating the adults and letting the kids get infected it seems.	0
